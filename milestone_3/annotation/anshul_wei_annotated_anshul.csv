"Bloody Nose, Empty Pockets review – bittersweet bar-room endgame","It’s the “last day in paradise” for Las Vegas dive bar the Roaring ’20s, which will shut permanently after the evening’s festivities. Over the next 18 hours, as the booze begins to flow, there are several slurred flirtations and a fight. Inevitably, at least one person takes their top off. The film is directed by Bill and Turner Ross (known for their documentaries 45365 and Tchoupitoulas), and shot fly-on-the-wall style. But elements of this riotous hybrid documentary are staged. The Roaring ’20s is actually in New Orleans, not Vegas, with characters street-cast, and playing fictionalised versions of themselves. Yet the sense of the watering hole as a haven for lost souls – not to mention the threat of gentrification to civic space – couldn’t be more vérité. Inside the bar, red fairylights give a rose-tinted glow. The film’s mood is bittersweet, never more so than in a scene that shows the revellers trailing into the car park to set off fireworks, depicted via grainy security camera footage. Sophie B Hawkins’s 1992 track Damn, I Wish I Was Your Lover (a pop song about bearing witness to an abusive relationship) plays softly from the jukebox inside. Martin, a regular, hovers by the bar, watching Hollywood western The Misfits. Like Eli Wallach’s Guido, whose voice can be heard on the TV, he’s “just looking for a place to hide and watch it all go by”.","Bloody Nose, Empty Pockets",FILM
Sylvie's Love review – Tessa Thompson captivates in jazz-hot romance,"Sylvie (Tessa Thompson) has been taught by her mother to stand tall, shoulders back and chin lifted, like a proper lady. Unobserved, she’s considerably looser, freer, grooving to Bill Haley’s See You Later, Alligator in the back of her father’s record store. It’s this uninhibited joy that catches the eye of struggling jazz saxophonist Robert (NFL player turned actor Nnamdi Asomugha) in Eugene Ashe’s glossy period romance. Set in Harlem between 1957 and 1962, the lusty spark between the pair combusts despite Sylvie’s engagement to the more respectable Lacy (Alano Miller). An unexpected pregnancy and a career-making gig in Paris are further obstacles. Thompson and Asomugha have great chemistry, but the film stalls a little in the second half, when the focus pivots towards the couple’s careers. Like Barry Jenkins’s If Beale Street Could Talk and Todd Haynes’s Carol, Ashe takes the form of the 50s melodrama and recentres it on characters the genre has tended to ignore. This isn’t as politically restless as those films – it’s less interested in subverting the “woman’s picture” than establishing itself as one. In the same way that Saul Leiter’s photographs of New York were a visual reference point for Carol, cinematographer Declan Quinn draws inspiration from Gordon Parks’s photo essays for Life magazine. The period costuming is also a dream, with Thompson as striking as any Golden Age heroine in a teal Chanel gown and white elbow-length gloves. Sylvie’s Love is on Amazon Prime",Sylvie's Love,FILM
Deliver Us From Evil review – frenzied hit-man thriller is full of cinematic life,"There’s a throb of menace driving this gonzo action-thriller from South Korean director Hong Won-chan, who wrote the screenplays for The Yellow Sea and The Chaser. This was a big box-office hit on its home turf. Hwang Jung-min is In-nam, a former cop turned paid assassin who has just whacked a yakuza in Tokyo, and now this dead man’s fanatically violent blood-brother Ray (Lee Jung-jae) is out for revenge. To add to this, In-nam hears that his former girlfriend has been killed in Bangkok, following a bungled attempt to make contact with the kidnappers of her nine-year-old daughter – and the child is still alive, in the abductors’ hands. So In-nam journeys to Thailand on a desperate redemptive mission to save this little girl, with the scary and blood-thirsty Ray on his trail, and the only person in Bangkok who can help him is Yui (Park Jung-min); Yui is a transgender woman who, for all that she is no mobster, manages at one stage to ram a van with her pickup truck, saving In-nam’s life. The twin storylines should undermine the film’s pace and focus. They don’t. There are some impressively spectacular shootouts in the streets and a Bourne-level rooftop chase, together with some very crunchy close-quarters martial arts. Hwang, his face almost always covered in beads of sweat, is a very persuasive and impassive action hero and Lee is creepy and uproariously over the top. Could he be a Bond villain in the years to come? The 007 franchise could certainly do a lot worse. Released on digital formats on 4 January.",Deliver Us From Evil,FILM
"The Call review – a phoned-in mix of ghouls, ghosts and well-worn tropes","This telephonically themed horror film, set in nameless American suburbia circa 1987, is not to be confused with the Korean horror film of the same name that also came out this year (and relies crucially on a landline call). This confection is a fairly shonky assemblage of tired tropes, full of dropped connections and annoying static. Its biggest virtue is that it contains another gamey, and game-for-anything, performance from horror-film matriarch Lin Shaye. Shaye has played spooky ladies in scads of scary films, such as the Insidious franchise and lesser known fare such as the enticingly titled Helen Keller vs Nightwolves. Here she is Edith Cranston, a former schoolteacher who has been a raving mess since being blamed for the death of one of her pupils (although never convicted of the murder). Nevertheless, a gaggle of teenagers, including Tonya (Erin Sanders), older sister of the murdered child, has persisted in taunting, teasing, playing pranks and bullying Edith for years. When Tonya and new kid in town Chris (Chester Rushing), along with brothers Brett (Sloane Morgan Siegel) and Zack (Mike Manning), finally push Cranston too far, she kills herself. But her husband Edward (Tobin Bell) summons the high-school seniors back to the house with a strange proposition: if they make a phone call on a decrepit old princess phone, ostensibly to a handset installed in Edith’s grave, and stay on the line for just one minute, they’ll each earn a substantial inheritance. Being teens in an American horror film, the kids are too stupid and greedy to twig this is a terrible idea. Traumatic flashbacks, mangled corpses with gymnastic abilities and blood-splattered undead apparitions soon ensue. One might posit a subtextual interpretation that the youth of today, reared on mobiles, are so unaccustomed to landlines that they see these once ubiquitous household fixtures simply as conveyances for transmitting evil. Released on 11 January on digital formats.",The Call,FILM
"This Is Not a Burial, It’s a Resurrection review – an uncompromising tale of resistance","This is an extraordinary and otherworldly feature film from the tiny landlocked kingdom of Lesotho in southern Africa. It is the tale of a rebel spirit: an elderly woman who opposes government plans to flood her village, making way for a dam. It’s a film about resistance and resilience, but director Lemohang Jeremiah Mosese is coolly unsentimental and realistic about the inevitable march of capitalism and construction. Weaving in ideas around displacement, collective identity and history, this film takes on almost mythic qualities. Some of the actors are non-professionals, but the central role is performed by Mary Twala, who appeared in Idris Elba’s Nelson Mandela biopic Long Walk to Freedom. She plays Mantoa, an 80-year-old widow whose son – her last remaining relative – is killed in a mining accident in neighbouring South Africa. (The film isn’t about poverty, but it’s present in every frame.) Feeling ready to die, Mantoa is making arrangements to be buried in the village graveyard when she hears of the dam project; villagers are to be forcibly resettled in the city. Mantoa decides to put stop to it. She has nothing left to live for, and in a sense this gives her real power. She doesn’t care about offending the pastor, or if people think she’s a witch; she is bent on being buried with her family. This is a severe, uncompromising film; it’s more like a series of images strung together, each framed exactingly, like a painting. At the centre of it all is Twala, often silent, her expression fixed in determination – no words needed. Mosese has said that to avoid cliche he wrote the character as a man then switched the name to female. And Twala gives a tremendous performance, intimate yet epic. This Is Not a Burial is the first film from Lesotho to be entered into the Oscars race for best international feature. Sadly, Twala did not live to share in the success; she died in July last year. • This Is Not a Burial, It’s a Resurrection is on Mubi from 13 January.","This Is Not a Burial, It’s a Resurrection",FILM
Ham on Rye review – subversive satire on suburban conformity,"First-time feature director Tyler Taormina has dreamed his way into a very strange and intriguing film: a Gen-Z reverie about life and fate, somewhere between The Prom and The Purge. The film never behaves as if it is anything other than a realist coming-of-age drama but there is something else going on. Haley (Haley Bodell) is part of a clique of popular high-school kids in a bland suburban town who are preparing to take part in a local tradition. She and some other girls are wearing floaty dresses of sacrificial white and getting ready to go down to a local deli called Monty’s – along with a whole crowd of other kids – for what seems to be a pairing-off ritual, like a dance without music or dancing. But there is a lot riding on this, and Haley can’t persuade herself that she wants to join in. Ham on Rye is a satirical parable on conformism and aspiration, and it speaks to anyone who, in settled adulthood, looks back to when their life and romantic chances were arbitrarily decided by a few events in their teens and early 20s. And there’s another layer, too. Ham on Rye takes a bleakly subversive look at the whole idea of breaking free of your boring suburban home town and making it in the glamorous adult world beyond. This is the theme of so many films, and perhaps it is the overriding theme of Hollywood itself. So many films succumb to the romantic fantasy that the way to do this is to be a rebel, a free-thinker, a defier-of-norms. Yet this film, in its surreal way, is grimly about something closer to the un-surreal truth: the people who got out of their boring, philistine home towns were overwhelmingly the competent conformists, at least outwardly and temporarily. They were the ones who worked hard, got good grades and went far away to college, where their individuality could at last flourish. Taormina’s meditation on all this could be compared to Yorgos Lanthimos or Gus Van Sant, but it is very individual work, as creepy as a ghost story. • Ham on Rye is available on Mubi from 11 January.",Ham on Rye,FILM
Vanguard review – Jackie Chan reunites with Stanley Tong for patriotic action comedy,"Veteran Hong Kong action director Stanley Tong reunites with his longtime star Jackie Chan for this amiable but rather under-par adventure with silly CGI effects. Chan is allowed one or two comedy moments, but takes a very straight and stately role as Tang, the “elder statesman”-type director of an elite private security firm called Vanguard, presiding over tough, battle-ready and apparently also catwalk-ready young people – and occasionally pulling a few martial arts moves. In his trim three-piece suit and glasses, however, he looks faintly like Ronnie Corbett. A Chinese accountant and his young wife are kidnapped in London’s Chinatown and Vanguard (with its preposterous HQ full of people wearing phone headsets and gazing at computer screens) is tasked with rescuing him, his wife and his winsome daughter, who is doing laudable conservation work in a nation state referred to initially as “Africa”. She is also vulnerable to abduction as she frolics with CGI big cats in Lion King world. Tang and his crew toughly resolve to rescue their man, while frowning at his supposedly unwitting links with arms dealers, the source of all his woes. Their adventure takes them all over the world, from London (where Chinatown and Buckingham Palace are apparently adjacent) to a fictional land that looks vaguely like Zambia and then to the ineffably boring but wealthy world of Dubai. The scene with a jetski on the edge of a waterfall deserves points, but this feels disposable: the Chinese New Year is earnestly referenced as part of the film’s strident and faintly humourless patriotism. • Vanguard is in cinemas and on digital formats from 8 January.",Vanguard,FILM
Vanguard review – an outrageous waste of Jackie Chan,"There’s an argument to be made that a film featuring a jet-ski machete fight on the edge of a waterfall, robotic surveillance wasps, solid gold supercars, weaponised attack hyenas and Jackie Chan doesn’t actually need to be good, in the conventional sense of the word. And with its multiple locations (London, Beijing, Dubai, Zambia, India) and efficiently packaged moments of nationalistic fervour, this action picture, which pits Chinese covert security organisation Vanguard against the scenery-mangling forces of evil, is clearly aiming for the pulpy escapist end of the market. But even so, there’s precious little fun to be had in this self-important mess of a movie. Chan plays the head of Vanguard, but spends an awful lot of time in the field with his elite agents. Their mission: to rescue a businessman and his eco-YouTuber daughter Fareeda (Ruohan Xu) from villains who see them as the route to a missing fortune and, ultimately, some kind of genocidal ultra-weapon. The score feels like being trepanned by music; the story, like the VFX action sequences, is illogical and hacked together. It’s an unforgivable waste of Jackie Chan, action-movie legend, reduced here to pratfalls and gurning double takes. Vanguard is available on multiple VOD platforms",Vanguard,FILM
Robin's Wish review – how a comedy giant was destroyed by dementia,"The genius of Robin Williams is taken as a given by this intensely sad documentary, which pays fleeting tribute to the actor and comedian’s talent but focuses mainly on the undiagnosed neurodegenerative disease that led him to take his own life in 2014. Lewy body dementia is a deadly and devastating condition, one that is little known and frequently misdiagnosed. And for someone like Williams, whose brilliance depended on the quickfire, sparking neural connections of his exceptional brain, the symptoms, which include fear, delusions and hallucinations, must have been particularly terrifying. This film, made at the behest of Williams’s widow, Susan Schneider, is intended to raise awareness of the condition. It’s certainly informative and affecting, but the limited use of early archive footage and the emphasis on Williams’s decline and suffering make for bleak viewing. • On multiple VOD platforms",Robin's Wish,FILM
Mayor review – an inspiring portrait of a Palestinian city official,"Local governance, according to Musa Hadid, mayor of the Palestinian city of Ramallah, is the most beautiful branch of politics. It’s certainly, as this compelling fly-on-the-wall documentary attests, the area in which he is able to have the most direct connection with the city and its people. The very likable Mayor Hadid is a robustly hands-on public servant – we watch him pondering city branding and overseeing the abseiling Santas at the Christmas tree lighting. We also see him dealing with a sewage spill, berating a bus driver for speeding and, in some of the film’s most dramatic moments, witnessing Israeli forces shooting at protesters, and finding himself temporarily besieged in the city hall. Deft editing and unexpectedly affecting music choices make for an engaging portrait of the kind of impassioned and dedicated politician who seems in short supply right now. • Mayor is available on Curzon Home Cinema, Dogwoof and iTunes",Mayor,FILM
The Intergalactic Adventures of Max Cloud review – video game send-up is virtually pointless,"Here is a throwaway space spoof, an affectionate send-up of the naffness of early 90s video games, that lovingly recreates the vintage details with its production design and fight choreography, but is troublingly low on scripted gags. It plays out in two dimensions: virtual and real life. Inside a computer game, explorer Max Cloud is an intergalactic hero, a preposterous macho knucklehead in latex, sturdily performed by actor and martial arts expert Scott Adkins, who has appeared in a few of the Marvels. I did wonder if an actor with the comic chops for some megaton silliness might have done some heavier lifting here. Meanwhile, in actual Brooklyn, teenage gamer Sarah (Isabelle Allen) is hooked on the Max Cloud video game. After a fight with her dad she is mysteriously teleported into the game – and into the body of a minor character, chef Jake (Elliot James Langridge). You might consider this a waste of a female lead – putting her into the body of a male actor – but there she stays for most of the movie. For any chance of making it back to her real life she must complete the game with the help of her friend playing in her bedroom (Franz Drameh). John Hannah is painfully unfunny as ultra baddie Revengor, who wants to destroy planet Earth over a past snub. This is a film so inoffensive that for the first 10 minutes I thought it was targeted at kids, until one of the characters dropped a swear (and thinking about it, anyone under 40 will be oblivious to its reference). But in lampooning naffness without enough laughs, it veers perilously close to actually being naff. A reminder that clever comedians are required to pull off daft comedy. • Released on 18 January on digital formats.",The Intergalactic Adventures of Max Cloud,FILM
The New Music review – Parkinson's meets punk in a feelgood fable,"There are some moments of genuine feeling in this uneven Dublin-set indie about a classical pianist who joins the punk scene after being diagnosed with early-onset Parkinson’s. I wasn’t entirely sold on all the performances and there is a fair amount of predictability in the storytelling. But it’s a film made with warmth and sincerity, and the energy of the soundtrack by local bands helps along the awkward bits. Cilléin McEvoy is pianist Adrian, a former child prodigy on the brink of classical stardom. He reacts with fury and denial to his Parkinson’s diagnosis, disappearing off to Dublin where he rents the fourth room in a shared house. His flatmates are three carefree students in a punk band – two men and female drummer – who don’t spot his telltale tremors. Adrian has known nothing but music and discipline since childhood, and, dressed in his expensive suit and shiny leather loafers, he is the antithesis of punk. But inevitably his sniffiness about the band’s primitive songs gives way to appreciation. There is something in McEvoy’s buttoned-down, accountant-stiff performance that is somehow unconvincing – or perhaps the character is too thinly written. Certainly, he’s eclipsed by Martina Babisova, who gives a lovely natural performance as cool drummer Jodie. When he behaves like a total prat after they sleep together, she calls him out in a way that is disarmingly open and honest; their relationship gives the film its beating heart. Director Chiara Viale is Italian and her camera chases about the Dublin streets looking for fun and good times – it made me desperate to get on a plane and go somewhere, to see something new. The film is a little patchy, but its feelgood mood is hard to resist. • The New Music is available from 18 January on digital platforms.",The New Music,FILM
The Doorman review – Ruby Rose turns model action hero,"Model-turned-actor Ruby Rose (Orange Is the New Black, John Wick: Chapter 2), is utterly mesmerising to look at – with her lush lips, perfectly shaped eyebrows and macho tattoos – but so far the jury is very much out on whether she can act more than merely adequately. This action vehicle doesn’t exactly strengthen the case for her defence, although she moves with impressive grace in the actiony bits when required in closeups that show her character, Ali, whupping bad guys’ asses. Rose is meant to be a former marine, haunted by a botched assignment that cost the lives of a family she was protecting. In the film’s present tense, she takes a job as a doorman – shouldn’t it be “lobby attendant” or even “doorperson”? – at a posh New York City building, only to wander accidentally into a heist that goes very wrong. A strangely immobile-featured Jean Reno offers an almost self-parodying turn as the snobbish yet brutal French mastermind of the criminal gang, who are looking for paintings looted by the Nazis years back. Ali must protect the husband (Rupert Evans), teenage son (Julian Feder) and irritatingly spunky daughter (Kíla Lord Cassidy) from harm – which involves a lot of skulking in the building’s secret passageways, making for a mostly one-set shoot that looks like it saved a lot on budget. Director Ryuhei Kitamura, whose career began with pulpy horror fare, directs with efficiency but a seeming total lack of awareness of how silly this all looks from a distance. There’s little humour or invention to leaven the deadened inertness of the script. • The Doorman is available from 18 January on digital platforms.",The Doorman,FILM
Daniel review – terrifying tale of an Isis captive,"Over the last couple of decades, Danish cinema has increasingly proved to have a strong aptitude for emotive, nuanced drama and intelligent engagement, particularly through documentary-making, with conflicts abroad. This inspired-by-a-true-story feature, from journeyman director Niels Arden Oplev (who helmed the original Girl With the Dragon Tattoo film) skilfully combines those two strands to tell the story of Daniel Rye, a young Danish photographer who was captured by Isis in Syria in 2013. Filmed in a wiggly, handheld fashion – such a signature of the Dogma 95 years it almost feels like a retro affectation – the plot tracks methodically through Daniel’s story, holding tight on the expressive face of Esben Smed, who rises to the physical challenges of the role. For starters, he has to convincingly pass as Rye when he was young enough to be a contender for the Danish gymnastics team, although presumably a stuntman performed most of the acrobatics we see. In the film, after an injury ruins Rye’s sports career, a shift into photojournalism takes him to Syria where he falls into the hands of Isis, which was barely known at that time. They demand a multimillion-dollar ransom, but the Danish government sticks to its policy of not negotiating with terrorists. The film toggles smoothly back and forth between Rye’s family back home, scrabbling to raise the money without letting the story get into the press, and Rye himself in Syria. Oplev doesn’t shy away from the depiction of torture and suffering experienced by Rye and his fellow prisoners, one of whom was James Foley, an American journalist whose plight became an international story. Anyone who followed the news at the time will know the tragedies that lay ahead, but the point here isn’t what happened but it why. There’s empathy for all those scarred by this conflict, even in a strange way for John (Amir El-Masry), the British-accented Isis jailer who makes Rye’s life hell but is revealed in closeup to be consumed with his own kind of psychic pain. This is another film about a white European mixed up in a Middle Eastern war they barely seem to understand, but on its own terms it’s a story well told. • Daniel is available from 18 January on digital formats.",Daniel,FILM
'The most honest person I ever met': Chadwick Boseman's widow pays tribute at Gotham film awards,"The first significant awards event of the current film cycle spread its net wide, but the main attention of the 2021 Gotham awards, designed to reward independent film-makers, was focused on a tearful speech given by Simone Ledward as she accepted an award on behalf of her late husband Chadwick Boseman. Boseman had been announced as a recipient of the Gothams’ annual tribute award, along with Viola Davis, Steve McQueen and Ryan Murphy. Ledward, whose marriage to Boseman was made public only after the actor’s death, said in her speech: “He was the most honest person I ever met … He was blessed to live many lives within his concentrated one. He harnessed the power of letting go and letting God’s love shine through. May we not let his conviction be in vain. It is my honour on behalf of my husband.” She added: “Chad … thank you. I love you. I am so proud of you. Keep shining your light on us.” Boseman was also nominated for best actor for his performance in Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, a biopic of the celebrated blues singer played by Davis. However, in the event the award went to Riz Ahmed for his role as a drummer with hearing problems in Sound of Metal, catapulting Ahmed into the wider awards race. There was another surprise win in the best actress category, with Nicole Beharie winning for her performance as a former pageant winner in Miss Juneteeth, defeating strong favourite Frances McDormand who had been nominated for festival hit Nomadland. However, Nomadland, the widely admired study of retiree victims of the 2008 financial crash directed by Chloé Zhao, did take two prizes – best feature and the audience award – making it the only film to claim more than one win on the night, cementing its status as an Oscar frontrunner.

"Hunted review – Red Riding Hood reboot is a nifty, nasty trip into the woods","Cinematic rethinks of classic fairytales, especially Red Riding Hood, are a micro-genre about as exasperating and banal as the “year X called and it wants its Y back” joke. In Hunted’s case insert, 1985 for X and “postmodern feminist trope” for Y. Nevertheless, this uncomfortable but adroitly executed horror version in which a young woman is chased through the woods by toxic male monsters is pretty good stuff: unnerving in the right ways and flecked with colourful, unexpected specks of wit. In what presumably must be rural Ireland given most of the supporting characters’ accents, Eve (Lucie Debay, feral and fierce) is a bit of an outsider, a French woman stuck in the middle of nowhere supervising the construction of a housing estate. A chance visit to a local bar brings her into the orbit of a charming, vulpine-featured nameless stranger who sounds American but is actually played by the French actor Arieh Worthalter. After he saves her from the aggressive attentions of another guy (Ciaran O’Brien), Eve lets down her guard only to find herself kidnapped by a psychotic, sadistic misogynist. Even worse, he’s a psychotic sadistic misogynist with a movie camera, and we all know how evil they are. From there on out, the rest of film is the narrative slap and tickle of escape-recapture as Eve, dressed in red duffel coat, tries to get away. She is in an ancient, soggy forest where there are a few other characters wandering around, ready to fill the roles of grandma and woodsman. But director Vincent Paronnaud, working from a script he co-wrote with Léa Pernollet and David H Pickering, adds a few kinks that divert the story from the tracks laid down by the fairytale origins. Thankfully, we only see glimpses of the footage of tortured women on the hideously believable nemesis’s camera, so ultimately the movie – just about – feels more like a critique of the character’s woman-hating mindset rather than a vehicle for it. Released on 14 January on Shudder.",Hunted,FILM
Recon review – GIs on a mission to nowhere,"The Tenet-style action “rewind” in Recon’s opening scene suggests this adaptation of Richard Bausch’s 2008 novel Peace, based on his grandfather’s wartime experiences, might offer more than the average second world war thriller. Don’t get your hopes up. There’s no time travel, nor multi-perspective narrative tricks, nor even an innovative depiction of trauma’s impact on memory. Recon takes place in just the single dimension of reality, and a rather leaden one at that. Alexander Ludwig (Vikings) stars as Marson, a US army corporal stationed somewhere in Italy, who is sent trudging into the mountains by a callous commanding officer on a pointless and potentially suicidal reconnaissance mission. He and his small crew are irritable, exhausted and haunted by a recently witnessed war crime, all of which they articulate at length as they struggle through the snow. Their guide is an elderly farmer (Franco Nero, AKA Mr Vanessa Redgrave; furnishing the film with some Italian suavity) who was unfortunate enough to have crossed their path. He may or may not be a secret Nazi sympathiser leading them into a trap, and his habit of mumbling, “I had a family … tutti morti,” doesn’t do much to allay suspicions. The soldiers’ chit-chat has some Catch-22-esque wit to it – especially when delivered by Marson’s Brooklyn-accented brother-in-arms Asch (a standout Chris Brochu). But there’s altogether too much of it. In a real combat situation, surely arguing this loudly about Hershey bars and baseball odds would have drawn the unwelcome attention of enemy forces, with deadly consequences. The fact that it doesn’t here saps any potential dramatic tension from the situation, notwithstanding all the unseen snipers and landmines they encounter. Bausch’s book has been praised for its existential profundity on religious matters, but very little of that makes it to the screen. • Recon is on digital platforms from 18 January.",Recon,FILM
Blithe Spirit review – Judi Dench presides over a deathly farce,"The classic Noël Coward comedy about a ghost (first filmed by David Lean in 1945 with Rex Harrison) has now been adapted again, with stage and TV director Edward Hall making his movie debut. It can only be described as an un-reinvention, a tired, dated and unfunny period piece that changes the original plot a bit but offers no new perspective, and no new reason to be doing it in the first place. (Not compared with, say, Matthew Warchus’s stage revival of Coward’s Present Laughter at the Old Vic, with Andrew Scott radically reinventing the leading role.) This film looks unironically like the tatty old musical revue show that Ken Russell imagined for his “meta” adaptation of The Boy Friend. Dan Stevens plays crime writer Charles Condomine, who has been creatively blocked since the death of his first wife Elvira (Leslie Mann) seven years before, and now tensely remarried to the more uptight Ruth (Isla Fisher). He has the idea of putting a spiritualist into the new movie screenplay he’s working on, and invites a notorious stage medium, Madame Arcati (Judi Dench), to his house to perform a seance, so that he can do some research into the wiles of these confidence tricksters. But, to his astonishment (and Madame Arcati’s), the seance brings back the ghost of Elvira, who wreaks havoc. Despite the heavyweight cast, the film’s production values are those of a kids’ TV show that might go out on a weekday afternoon. Dench does her best with the role of Madame Arcati, and she even has a notably surreal moment, carrying out an occult ceremony in a beachside cave. But the rest is a festival of mugging and farcical overacting, and the Cowardian style seems brittle without any snap. • Blithe Spirit is on Sky Cinema from 15 January.",Blithe Spirit,FILM
Imperial Blue review – Ugandan adventures of a drug-smuggling dope,"Drug smuggler Hugo (Nicolas Fagerberg) has “the connect”. Or he’d like to think he does. Certainly this debut feature from British director Dan Moss knows several good spots, guiding us through a series of impressive locations with the confidence of a seasoned traveller. After Hugo’s big-money hashish deal in a partly flooded Mumbai building site goes wrong, he’s introduced to Bulu, a blue-powdered hallucinogen with mystical properties. “They say it makes you see the future,” says his go-between (Ashish Verma). Could this mysterious substance make Hugo enough money to satisfy his UK-based bosses? He’ll have to track down a supply source first. Everything about the London drug world that Hugo then stops off in – from the 80s punk get-ups of the big players to the readiness with which these supposedly shrewd operators approve Hugo’s wild goose chase – is risibly unrealistic. But he’s soon en route to “Fort Lugard, Uganda”, where the plot is on safer ground. The wise decision to employ locals where possible tells in the compelling specificity of the Ugandan settings and characters. Esther Tebandeke and Rehema Nanfuka are both excellent as, respectively, Kisakye, a village woman with access to the blue stuff and a healthy suspicion of Hugo, and Angela, Kisakye’s more worldly, scheming sister. Hugo is also a very believable example of the kind of straggly bearded adventure-seeker who’s convinced he’s blending in with the locals. Too believable, almost. These guys get tiresome after a 10-minute chat at the backpacker hostel bar, so why construct a whole film around his story? Especially with an abundance of more intriguing characters relegated to the margins. Imperial Blue aims at a knowing satire of colonial arrogance, yet still, somehow, it’s all about the white guy. Eurocentrism is one helluva drug. • Imperial Blue is available from 18 January on digital platforms.",Imperial Blue,FILM
Stardust review – David Bowie biopic is an odd-couple oddity,"The very talented actor and musician Johnny Flynn here makes a perfectly game attempt to impersonate the young David Bowie in this ironised and fictionalised account of Bowie’s 1971 US publicity tour which – partly – inspired his Ziggy Stardust persona. Flynn carries off Bowie’s clothes and delicate mannerisms plausibly enough and, impressively, he does his own singing. But, all too often, this Bowie looks as if he is presenting TV’s Bake Off. Bowie arrived at Washington DC’s Dulles airport where an immigration official called him a “fag”, and where Mercury Records publicity man Ron Oberman (played here by comic Marc Maron) arrived to meet him, having got a lift to the airport from his mum and dad, and took the bemused Bowie back for a home-cooked family meal, like a 13-year-old foreign exchange student. The movie shows this, but where in reality the tour saw Bowie fly to major cities, meeting with Oberman a few times and doing interviews, the movie escalates this to a huge comedy-odd-couple road trip. Oberman and Bowie head across the country in Ron’s uncool, un-rock’n’roll station wagon, with Bowie playing disastrous, low-key gigs and Ron becoming a Spinal Tap-type PR goof who is mortified at the poor turnout. Meanwhile, back in London, Jena Malone plays the heavily pregnant Angie Bowie, who comes across as a charmlessly shrill and bad-tempered scold, and David is having traumatised flashback memories of his troubled brother Terry (Derek Moran). The movie makes a laboured connection between Terry’s mental illness and David’s dark imaginings, a connection that surely comes close to misunderstanding the nature of schizophrenia. And so the tour goes on, and Bowie providentially hears (or hears about) the music of Iggy Pop and cult psychobilly star Legendary Stardust Cowboy, which fed into the Ziggy Stardust creation. This is a strained, frustrating concoction that doesn’t do its subject justice. Flynn really can sing, though. • Stardust is available from 15 January on digital platforms.",Stardust,FILM
Macaulay Culkin joins calls to get Donald Trump cameo removed from Home Alone 2,"Home Alone star Macaulay Culkin has endorsed social media comments demanding Donald Trump’s cameo in the film’s sequel be digitally removed and replaced with one of an older version of Culkin himself. Culkin replied to a tweet that asked “petition to digitally replace trump in ‘home alone 2’ with 40-year-old macaulay culkin” with the single word: “Sold.” Culkin then followed up by responding “Bravo” to another tweet that contained a comic edit of Trump replaced by empty space. Trump appears briefly in Home Alone 2: Lost in New York when Culkin, as its hero Kevin, asks him for directions to the lobby of the Plaza hotel, which Trump owned at the time. In an interview with Insider in December 2020, the film’s director Chris Columbus said that Trump “did bully his way into the movie” by insisting he get a role in the film in return for allowing shooting to take place in the hotel. Columbus added that Trump’s cameo was a popular move: “When we screened it for the first time the oddest thing happened – people cheered when Trump showed up on screen. So I said to my editor, ‘Leave him in the movie. It’s a moment for the audience.’” A petition on change.org to replace Trump with Joe Biden had accrued 189 signatures at time of publication.",Macaulay Culkin,PERFORMER
MLK/FBI review – startling study of the war against Martin Luther King,"The FBI’s secret campaign of bugging, harassment and defamation against Martin Luther King Jr in the 60s is the subject of this startling but sometimes frustratingly reticent and guarded documentary. This poisonous dirty-tricks campaign continued until King’s assassination in Memphis in 1968, a murder that the bureau was somehow unable to prevent, despite its fanatical round-the-clock surveillance of King as well as its loudly proclaimed dedication to crimefighting. It is now a matter of record that King was a flawed human being and had extramarital sex, but this is an enduringly mysterious part of his public image. (Even Ava DuVernay’s very fine biopic account of King in her 2014 movie Selma, starring David Oyelowo, tactfully romanticises these indiscretions.) The bureau’s audio tapes of alleged meetings in hotel rooms were finally, in 1977, handed over to the National Archives by order of a federal judge but sealed – they cannot be released until 2027 at the earliest. What exactly will they prove? Anything at all? All we have right now are the typescripts of the agents’ highly subjective summary reports. This film from Sam Pollard, based largely on the work of Pulitzer-winning historian David J Garrow, shows how bizarrely toxic and dysfunctional the FBI’s campaign was, an ongoing secret war that involved running informants within the civil rights movement – a painful and even tragic aspect of this history that probably deserves a documentary of its own. Bureau director J Edgar Hoover was incensed by King’s leftist associations, and by his international celebrity, especially after he was awarded the Nobel peace prize in 1964. After chancing on evidence of his adultery, Hoover hoped to use this to undermine him, and with extraordinary spite circulated the tapes to King’s wife Coretta and even to church leaders and the press, apparently hoping (in vain) that someone would go public. There was even a suggestion that King was present at a rape – and this film, very gingerly indeed, comes close to hinting that there might one day be a #MeToo case to answer. But wait. Where is the proof here? Where is the naming of names? Surely the bureau, with all the dark powers at its command, could have induced one of King’s alleged mistresses to come forward and go public? Apparently not. It is a question that this film does not fully address, although it certainly gives us a queasily detailed picture of Hoover’s pure paranoid nastiness. • MLK/FBI is on digital platforms from 15 January.",MLK/FBI,FILM
Archive review – anyone for a posthuman wife? She comes with an off switch,"British illustrator and visual-effects director Gavin Rothery makes his feature debut with this artificial intelligence thriller: a tale of love, death and robotics that has some nicely creepy moments. Set in 2038, it centres on lonely computer scientist George Almore (Divergent’s Theo James), who is holed up in a remote research facility in Japan secretly working on an android version of his wife Jules (Stacy Martin); she has died in a car crash. His prototype, J3 (also played by Martin), is his closest yet to the real thing: a highly advanced humanoid with spookily pale skin who looks like she might be the ghost of his dead wife. Poor old J1 and J2, his earlier, clunkier prototypes: they look on bitterly as the newer, sleeker model gets all George’s attention. The movie opens with sweeping helicopter shots over a snowy forest. Inside the concrete bunker-like facility, Rothery works wonders with a modest budget (he was behind the look of Duncan Jones’s Moon), creating an ungimmicky nearish future that looks a lot like today. When George’s corporate bosses threaten to pull the plug on his research, he hurries to put the finishing touches to J3 – a task involving the contents of a fridge-like archive unit containing his dead wife’s consciousness. George is surrounded by the robot versions of Jules. J1 is boxy, non-verbal and baby-like. J2 is a little more advanced: she can speak, and behaves like a teenager, huffing jealously when George removes her legs to give to J3. In the end, George is playing God – creating a woman not from a rib but electrical components and computer programming. The script’s take on this is romantic: here is a man who’ll do whatever it takes to be reunited with his wife. I couldn’t help finding it a bit more sinister; when J2 misbehaves, George orders her back to her docking station. He is in control. (Anyone for a posthuman wife? She comes with an off switch.) And the final ta-da revelation felt a bit contrived. Still, Archive is refreshingly non-cerebral – and that’s a compliment. It’s a sci-fi movie that wants to entertain, not deliver a lecture on AI. • On digital formats from 18 January.",Archive,FILM
Armie Hammer drops out of Jennifer Lopez film amid social media controversy,"Armie Hammer has dropped out of an upcoming film with Jennifer Lopez after messages allegedly sent by the actor were leaked online. Hammer has described the messages and social media response to them as an online attack, calling them vicious and spurious. Hammer, star of movies including The Social Network and Call Me By Your Name, had been set to appear opposite Lopez in action comedy Shotgun Wedding. However, he will no longer take the role. A production spokesman told the PA news agency: “Given the imminent start date of Shotgun Wedding, Armie has requested to step away from the film and we support him in his decision.” Hammer, 34, became the focus of social media commentary over the weekend after explicit and disturbing messages alleged to have been sent by him were circulated online. Hammer said in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter on Wednesday: “I’m not responding to these bullshit claims but in light of the vicious and spurious online attacks against me, I cannot in good conscience now leave my children for four months to shoot a film in the Dominican Republic. Lionsgate is supporting me in this and I’m grateful to them for that.” Shotgun Wedding will be directed by Pitch Perfect filmmaker Jason Moore and follows a couple who get cold feet before they are due to walk down the aisle. Things are complicated further when the wedding party is hijacked by criminals. Hammer played the Winklevoss twins in The Social Network and starred opposite Timothee Chalamet in acclaimed drama, Call Me By Your Name. He most recently appeared opposite Lily James in a Netflix adaptation of Rebecca. • With Press Association",Armie Hammer,PERFORMER
MLK/FBI review – state-sanctioned harassment of a hero,"Sam Pollard’s archive documentary cleverly uses the FBI’s pursuit of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr to tell the entwined history of leftwing protest and state-sanctioned surveillance. Former FBI director J Edgar Hoover feared “the rise of a black messiah” would disrupt the segregated status quo, and so set out to use information about King’s private life, such as his extramarital affairs, to discredit his public persona. Pollard includes clips from movies such as Big Jim McLain and The FBI Story to show how the bureau infiltrated pop culture to cultivate an image of itself as “reasonable, sane and patriotic”. MLK/FBI reframes this as propaganda, and shows how King’s antiracist project was viewed as anti-American political dissent. Pollard’s decision to eschew traditional talking heads in favour of voiceover interviews allows the archive to take centre stage. The director first looked at King in an episode of PBS’s Peabody award-winning Eyes on the Prize II in 1990. Thirty years later, his life remains rich terrain for Pollard, who is keen to consider him as a complicated and fallible man rather than an untouchable icon. • MLK/FBI is available on multiple VOD platforms",MLK/FBI,FILM
Blithe Spirit review – unhappy reimagining of Coward's classic,"This asinine adaptation of Noël Coward’s 1941 stage play stars Downton Abbey’s Dan Stevens as author Charles Condomine, who accidentally summons the playful ghost of his late first wife after participating in an ill-advised seance. Stevens plays Condomine as a cliche of a blocked writer, emboldened by booze and misogyny, knee-deep in discarded drafts of a screenplay based on his bestselling crime novel. Edward Hall’s film attempts to send up Condomine for leeching off a female muse, which clashes somewhat with the source material’s “blithe” mood. The impish Leslie Mann is well cast as his dead wife, Elvira, who provides a jolt of creative inspiration. Judi Dench’s screechy caricature of psychic Madame Arcati is less winning.

Stardust review – David Bowie biopic has no sparkle,"The year is 1971 and David Bowie (Johnny Flynn) is about to embark on his first US tour. Except he only has a tourist visa and so he’s not supposed to perform – convenient, given that the film-makers were unable to secure the rights to any of Bowie’s original music. Its omission is noticeably awkward, with Flynn doing inert versions of tracks Bowie covered, such as Jacques Brel’s My Death, as a clumsy workaround. The narrative centres around a supposedly formative road trip Bowie took with his American publicist Ron Oberman (Marc Maron), suggesting that encounters with Andy Warhol and the Velvet Underground helped give birth to Bowie’s alter ego Ziggy Stardust. Troublingly, flashbacks that look at Bowie’s relationship with his half-brother Terry Burns (Derek Moran) imply that the singer’s family history of psychosis also played a significant part in the creation of his onstage persona. A title card indicates that the film is fictionalised and so perhaps shouldn’t be scrutinised for fidelity. Still, the whole thing feels strangely pedestrian, unable to capture or channel Bowie’s maverick spirit. Available on multiple VOD platforms",Stardust,FILM
"Are We Lost Forever review – breakup drama runs out of steam, if not sex","Sheets in disarray, two lovers avoiding each other’s gaze; Swedish director David Färdmar opens his feature debut with an emotional bomb blast in a perfect white bedroom. “So you can’t even say it any more,” spits out Adrian (Björn Elgerd). Finally, Hampus (Jonathan Andersson) concedes: “I love you. But there is no more ‘we’.” Leaving the wounds hidden, this is a promisingly imposing opening scene – but Färdmar, as he charts the pair’s breakup, can’t fully flesh it out in a stiff and increasingly laboured LGBT drama. Initially, it’s a duel for moving-on supremacy. Adrian seems to take the early lead, hooking up with an ex, while Hampus appears the needier, tearfully manipulating him back into bed. But it’s Hampus who strikes out first on a new relationship, while Adrian – resentment weighing behind his eyes – remains hostage to the issues that sabotaged them in the first place. Seeking to give these intimate negotiations epic dimensions, Are We Lost Forever follows in the footsteps of Abdellatif Kechiche’s Blue Is the Warmest Colour, sharing the same taste for establishing its naturalistic credentials through explicit sex scenes. On the other hand, Färdmar struggles to deliver the dramatic money shots. Adrian’s control issues – obvious in the bedroom, and ably conveyed elsewhere by Elgerd’s watchful performance – are made clear. But the film isn’t focused enough to open this trait out into a compelling character study. The often-soapy exchanges in which Adrian masks his hurt before someone reaches across the table mean that the film’s initially well-braced rhythm starts to drag, while Färdmar’s rigid framings are a far cry from Kechiche’s limber entanglement with his lovers. Like its protagonist, Are We Lost Forever can’t break free. • Are We Lost Forever is released on 22 January on digital platforms.",Are We Lost Forever,FILM
Heroes Don't Die review – reincarnation mystery is on life support,"Heroes Don’t Die is the second recent film – after Quentin Dupieux’s absurdist Deerskin, also due in the UK in 2021 – in which French high-flyer Adèle Haenel gets behind a camera to soothe a wounded male ego. Here she plays film-maker Alice, who decides to humour her friend Joachim (Jonathan Couzinié) who, after being collared in a Paris street by an angry Slav, comes to believe he is the reincarnation of Zoran, a Bosnian soldier who died on 21 August 1983 – the day he was born. The pair pack the digicam and head Balkans-ward to track down the truth. Debut director Aude Léa Rapin, co-writing with Couzinié, reaches for Nouvelle Vague-like sprightliness with this meta-filmic setup. But it has the unfortunate effect of spotlighting Heroes Don’t Die’s self-regard and hesitancy over what form to take. If it’s satirising first-person documentaries, it doesn’t keep that subject in sharp focus. The character-study element, as Alice begins to doubt Joachim’s sincerity about his belief in reincarnation, feels expedient. It engages only sketchily with Bosnian history: it situates its story in Bratunac, the next town over from Srebenica. This tempting proximity to seriousness, when a war widow draws parallels between her and Joachim’s situations, leads Rapin towards borderline misjudged musings (“It’s good to tell yourself stories.”) Haenel, the film’s moral centre, is capable of both the Clintonian hauteur she showed in Portrait of a Lady on Fire and a gabbling, caffeinated over-seriousness used to fine effect in 2018 French comedy hit En liberté!, but this film leaves her dashing between the two poles. True to form, though, for the film’s slightly maddening inconsistency, in the final 10 minutes – as Joachim encounters a peasant woman who may or may not be the dead soldier’s wife – a gripping, almost wordless scene delivers pathos, thematic depth and a poetic kick from a glorious Bosnian hillside all at once. Otherwise, it is a largely frustrating exercise; sometimes history is best left in the backdrop. • Heroes Don’t Die is on Mubi from 21 January.",Heroes Don't Die,FILM
UK reimposes Covid-related travel restrictions on film and TV crew,"Film and TV crew are no longer exempt from coronavirus restrictions related to job travel, it has emerged. The UK government’s list of jobs that qualify for travel exemptions has been updated to remove “television production” and “high end television production and film”, which means that executives and crew arriving in the UK will have to isolate for 10 days. The move is a reversal of the widely publicised policy that saw film-makers and crew allowed into the UK in July without quarantine as part of a government drive to get film production in the UK back up and running. Culture secretary Oliver Dowden had made the announcement after apparently consulting with Tom Cruise, whose Mission Impossible films were among the Hollywood productions to restart shooting in the UK in September. Other productions likely to be affected include The Batman, starring Robert Pattinson, which had been halted for two weeks in September after Pattinson tested positive for coronavirus. The only media-related job on the government’s list still exempt from travel restrictions appears to be workers on the BBC’s broadcasting transmission network and services.",UK government,OTHERS
About Some Meaningless Events review – attempted murder and the movies,"Here is an intriguing, bewildering fragment of what might be called underground new-wave cinema from Moroccan director Mostafa Derkaoui: a docu-fiction shown once in Paris in 1975, but then immediately banned by the Moroccan government after which it disappeared from view, resurfacing in 2016 when a negative was found in the archives of Filmoteca De Catalunya in Barcelona. Derkaoui and a group of other young film-makers are shown hanging out in Casablanca, in a bar and on the streets and at the port, interviewing people about what they think cinema should be doing. Long scenes in bars spool past, apparently semi-improvised, in which the film-makers and their interviewees get very drunk, among lots of other drunk people who are always on the verge of an argument or a fist fight They occasionally ask young women in the bar what they think about cinema and shamelessly tell them they are beautiful enough to be in the movies, asking for their contact details. Then they realise that one of the guys they have interviewed, a man at the port who had claimed to be a teacher, was in fact a dockworker, who had tried to kill his boss – a mob racketeer who was taking most of this man’s pay. And so there are more long conversations (only deadly serious and sober, this time) about whether they can include this footage, about whether this makes them complicit in a crime, or whether this is not an opportunity for precisely the kind of socially engaged cinema they’ve been yearning for. It’s not clear how much of this is real and how much fiction: the entirety of the “murder” may be a reconstruction of a real case. An interesting archive oddity. • About Some Meaningless Events is available on Mubi from 20 January.",About Some Meaningless Events,FILM
12 Hour Shift review – guts and gore in cheerful bad-taste horror,"In the 90s, everyone had heard the urban myth about black-market organ trading: the story of the poor chump who went to a party and woke up in a bath of ice minus a kidney. Now, with this blackly funny, cheerfully violent bad-taste comedy-horror, director Brea Grant riffs on the legend. Her film is set in 1999 in the ER unit of an Arkansas hospital where one of the nurses, Mandy (Angela Bettis), runs a side hustle in organ trafficking. Whenever a patient who is unlikely to make it is wheeled in, she earmarks them for harvest – and has even been known to nudge victims along with an injection of bleach. Mandy arrives for the night shift dead exhausted. Patients assume that she is overworked, but the truth is that Mandy is addicted to opiates, slipping vials of morphine into her scrubs pocket. She bankrolls her habit with the organ business, working in cahoots with nursing colleague Karen (Nikea Gamby-Turner). Bettis is terrific, beautifully underplaying Mandy’s bone-dry sense of humour: she is openly contemptuous of patients and their families, rolls her eyes at colleagues and refreshingly has zero anxiety to please. And while she may bump off the odd patient, she is also highly competent. She is not, however, a criminal mastermind. Things go seriously wrong when Mandy recruits her cousin, textbook airhead blonde Regina (Chloe Farnworth), who botches a kidney pick-up. After misplacing the organ, Regina puts on a nurse’s uniform and decides to find another patient to kill. It’s a throwaway film that perhaps I shouldn’t have enjoyed as much as I did, but Mandy is such a deliciously sour character. • Available from 25 January on digital platforms.",12 Hour Shift,FILM
Persian Lessons review – hard-to-believe Holocaust survival drama,"Here’s a superbly acted, though worryingly polite, Holocaust survival drama by the Ukrainian film-maker Vadim Perelman. It’s the story of a Jewish man from Belgium called Gilles (Nahuel Pérez Biscayart), who stays alive in a transit camp by pretending to be half-Iranian and teaching Farsi to a savage-tempered SS officer, Klaus Koch (Lars Eidinger). In truth, Gilles doesn’t know a word of Farsi; the language he makes up is gibberish, and he lives in constant terror of slipping up, forgetting one of the words he’s invented – almost 600 in six months. The film opens with the line “inspired by true events”, but given the plausibility issues here surely it is safe to prefix that claim with “very loosely”. The setting is France, 1942; Gilles, the son of a rabbi, is transported to a transit camp with other Jews caught trying to flee to Switzerland. A hustler by nature, Gilles easily – too easily – persuades Nazi officer Koch that he speaks Farsi. Koch is a chef by training and dreams of opening a restaurant in Iran after the war. Suspecting Gilles of lying, he grills him, with laughably easy questions: “What is the capital of Persia?” “What language do they speak?” Persian Lessons is more credible as a psychological study – and, if a performance can rescue a film, it’s Biscayart’s portrayal of Gilles. With his gaunt face and perpetually stunned expression, he is the embodiment of Primo Levi’s man who knows no peace, who lives by a yes or no. But Perelman goes light on the audience. He refrains from depicting anything too harrowing – there’s nothing here too brutal or upsetting to make you look away from the screen. This fable about language and memory is a troublingly easy watch – though it floored me in the devastating final moments, unexpectedly acquiring great depth and seriousness of purpose. • Persian Lessons is on digital platforms from 22 January.",Persian Lessons,FILM
LX 2048 review – James D’Arcy lets rip in forgettable dystopian mish-mash,"James D’Arcy is one of those good-looking, highly competent British actors who is steadily and widely employed, but seldom gets cast in the main role – apart from, say, playing Edward VIII in Madonna’s memorably panned biopic WE. This quirky, low-budget science-fiction feature gives him a chance to let rip (maybe just a smidge too much at times) as Adam Bird, a depressed middle manager for a technology firm. The American accents everyone puts on, even though most of the cast is British, suggests that events are supposed to be taking place somewhere in North America, though the cityscape, with its glowing monorail and CGI skyline, is pretty obviously a set – in this case a studio in Vilnius, Lithuania. That barely matters because the characters hardly ever go outside, and if they do it’s mainly at night because the sun is now so hot and toxic. Writer-director Guy Moshe has mashed together some solid and recently fashionable dystopian conceits, touching, for instance, on the existential dilemmas of cloning, or the lovelessness of always-online society. However, after a promising start featuring lushly brutalist production design – all concrete, 3D printed plastic and recessed lighting – the concepts start to feel like a less interesting Black Mirror episode, and the last act is a mess. But D’Arcy really goes hell for leather as his character starts to unravel: he faces betrayal from his wife (Anna Brewster), a Mephistophelian inventor (Delroy Lindo) and eventually his own facsimile. Jagged editing with explicatory flashbacks doesn’t make it any easier to parse, and the confinement to a single set for most of the second half evokes experimental fringe theatre, not necessarily in a good way. However, the scene where Adam shags a rubber sex doll will live on in the memory long after you’ve forgotten what the film was actually about. • LX 2048 is available on digital platforms from 25 January.",LX 2048,FILM
The Rental review – predictable cabin-in-the-woods scares,"Initial high hopes are dashed at the third-act stage of this disappointing cabin-in-the-woods horror-mystery in which actor Dave Franco (brother of James) makes his directorial debut, co-writing with mumblecore film-maker Joe Swanberg. Two couples rent an ocean-front beach house for a luxury weekend getaway: tech entrepreneur Charlie (Dan Stevens) and his partner Michelle (Alison Brie), with Charlie’s brother, Josh (Jeremy Allen White), and Josh’s partner, Mina (Sheila Vand), who is also the co-owner of Charlie’s tech startup. When the foursome arrives, they are instantly nettled by the guy showing them around the property: Taylor (Toby Huss) makes casually racist comments about Mina. And it turns out their ultra-fancy rental has some very strange things about it. Are they being spied on? The dynamic between the four characters is interesting at first, in part because there is already some difficult sexual and social tension between them; it isn’t just the weirdo place they find themselves in. But when the gory/scary stuff really starts happening, the film suddenly loses its dramatic charge. The focus is muddled and uncertain. When tough guy Josh (who we learn has already done jail time for violence) starts taking action against someone who might not actually have done anything wrong, the film starts becoming more of a suspense thriller in which our four hapless heroes have to cover up their own misdeeds. It almost seems as if they themselves are the bad guys, which undermines the potency and the dramatic point of the threat that emerges from the darkness. It’s pretty basic boilerplate, scary-movie stuff, with tropes and tricks that have already been extensively satirised elsewhere. • The Rental is available on Amazon Prime Video from 22 January.",The Rental,FILM
The Exception review – psycho-thriller foiled by lazy sexism,"Depressingly, this Danish psychological thriller resurrects some pretty outdated sexist stereotypes with a quartet of emotionally manipulative, unsisterly and two-timing female characters. It comes to us from a trio of men: director Jesper W Nielsen and a script by Christian Torpe, who adapts Christian Jungersen’s bestselling novel about four women working at a small NGO investigating genocide. When they begin to receive death threats, their suspicions turn on each other – and the film plays with the possibility that inside each of them may lurk a crazy psycho bitch. Danica Curcic plays Iben, an earnest researcher who was recently held hostage in Kenya by terrorists. Back in Copenhagen she is experiencing PTSD, at night seeing the child soldier who guarded her, a gentle, soulful-looking boy. Iben works at the NGO with her best friend Malene (Amanda Collin), a beautiful, complicated woman who shows cruel disregard for other people’s feelings. With the team administrator Camilla (Lene Maria Christensen) they snidely gang up on the new librarian Anne-Lise (Sidse Babett Knudsen). It’s Iben who gets the first threatening email. Everyone assumes the sender is a Serbian war criminal – but might it be Anne-Lise? There is nothing wrong with the performances. The best-friend dynamic of Iben and Malene feels nicely complex and plausible – which is more than can be said for the rest of the film. The two women have recently co-authored a book exploring the psychology of war criminals, and its thesis is that most people have something inside them ready to commit evil. And their pass-agg workplace bullying appears to be meant as a small-scale equivalent of that tendency, leading to some truly absurd plot twists as the characters turn on each other. Throughout the film I had the niggling feeling that at the bottom of it is a deep dislike of women – or, at the very least, a total lack of understanding. • The Exception is available on digital platforms from 22 January.",The Exception,FILM
The Wacky Hen review – circus comedy is a flightless flop,"This animated Argentinian-Spanish co-production offers a pretty undistinguished tale of a zero-to-hero talking creature (a scrawny, bug-eyed hen named Turuleca, voiced by Elisabeth Gray) who joins the circus and becomes a star – though it’s fair to say that the character, lighting and set designs are often striking. Even so, most of the nice, more-central-to-the-plot characters are very bland, while Turuleca herself is an emphatically hideous creation. On the other hand, there’s a higher degree of craft to the villains and secondary cast members, with their gargoyle faces and stylised figures. The opening act, where our avian heroine is acquired by sweet little old retired music teacher Isabel (Roxanne Bachmann), seems to augur the usual hyper-idealised view of farm life. But when Isabel falls off a roof and has to go to hospital to recover from amnesia, things kick up a notch: Turuleca, on her way to find her mistress, falls in with a troupe of circus folk. The dancing, songs and assorted circus-y antics strike a nice balance between the fantastic possibilities of the cartoon form and enough verisimilitude to keep more literal-minded kids engaged. And it’s a nice touch that this very modern, ethical circus won’t use animal acts because animals can’t give their consent – a rule that’s cleverly circumvented here by having a sentient, talking chicken as its protagonist. The voice acting from the cast for this dubbed-into-US-accented English version is also serviceable if not particularly outstanding. At least the maladroit song translations from Spanish into English create hilariously inept lyrics that sometimes don’t even bother to rhyme. • The Wacky Hen is available on digital platforms from 25 January.",The Wacky Hen,FILM
Cannes film festival 2021 to be delayed until July – report,"The Cannes film festival will be delayed from its customary May slot until July, it has been reported. According to Variety, the festival’s organisers will announce new dates for the 2021 edition this month, after last year’s event was called off following a series of postponements. According to the report, the organisers have confirmed their resolve to host a physical event in 2021, after the cancellation of Cannes in 2020 dealt a body blow to the international release circuit. If the festival does move from May, July appears the most likely timeslot: later in the year would precipitate a clash with major festivals such as Venice and Toronto, which normally take place in the last week of August or the first week in September; while space in Cannes in June is already taken by the Cannes Lions advertising festival, which is due to go ahead as planned. Variety suggests that the Cannes hotel organisation, the Syndicat des Hotels de Cannes et du Bassin Cannois, has been already told the festival will move to July – normally peak tourist season, but currently badly hit by the pandemic travel restrictions. A local hotelier is quoted as saying: “The dates we’ve agreed on are between July 5-25. So, the festival could start roughly around July 5, or a few days later.” According to an interview in French magazine Les Inrockuptibles, Cannes general delegate Thierry Fremaux has also raised the possibility of extending the festival’s length due to the likelihood of a backlog of high-quality films delayed by the pandemic. After the festival was called off in 2020, Fremaux presented a selection of over 50 films, including Wes Anderson’s as-yet-unreleased The French Dispatch, Pixar animation Soul, which premiered on streaming platform Disney+ in December, and Lovers Rock and Mangrove from Steve McQueen’s Small Axe anthology for the BBC.",Cannes film festival 2021,OTHERS
Tokyo Dragon Chef review – ramen-themed yakuza musical comedy,"Cult Japanese filmmaker Yoshihiro Nishimura, who started off doing special effects before moving into the director’s chair, is best known for pulpy, action-horror fare with self-explanatory titles such as Mutant Girls Squad and Tokyo Gore Police, as well as the more enigmatically monikered Meatball Machine Kodoku. Tokyo Dragon Chef, I’m assuming, lies tonally between the one about gore police and the one about meatball machines given it’s about a pair of ageing yakuza thugs, Ryu (Yasukaze Motomiya) and Tatsu (Yoshiyuki Yamaguchi), who decide to open a ramen restaurant. Their speciality, which does indeed look darn tasty, is a recipe Tatsu honed while doing time and working in the prison’s mess hall, a kind of ma po tofu with ramen. Soon, their tiny venue is drawing rave reviews from YouTubers and a pretty schoolgirl (played by pop star Rinne Yoshida) comes round to sing songs about ramen because – of course – this is also a musical. But then another pair of rival ex-yakuza types (the joke is that all four actors used to play gangsters in straighter films back in the day) start up a food truck business selling ramen across the street. What’s more, they’ve hired a buxom, pink-haired creature in a latex bodysuit (Saiko Yatsuhashi) who may not actually be human and somehow never feels the strain of the enormous quantities of food she can eat. The Japanese dialogue is probably much funnier than the subtitles make it seem, but it’s hard not to suspect that even native speakers might find the film’s concept more amusing than its execution. You have probably seen TikTok videos with more budget than this film. But it’s playful and brisk, and what’s not to love about any movie that has baddies who go around with giant eyeball masks on their heads, just like the immortal experimental punk band the Residents? • Tokyo Dragon Chef is available on digital platforms from 25 January.",Tokyo Dragon Chef,FILM
The White Tiger review – gripping adaptation of Aravind Adiga's class parable,"Powered by a surging, impatient energy and a bracing undercurrent of spite, Ramin Bahrani’s version of Aravind Adiga’s 2008 Booker prize-winning novel is one of the more successful literary adaptations of recent years. The story of a poor but wily driver who claws his way out of the cage created by caste and servitude to become a success story in the new India, it’s not subtle in approach. Nor should it be: it’s a full-blooded assault on a rigged system designed to keep the privileged in their lofty place and the poor on the streets far below. Although it leans heavily on narration, the film’s skittish cinematography brings texture to the backdrop and a satisfying depth to the characters. The narrator is Balram (Adarsh Gourav, excellent in a slippery, hard-to-like role); he’s smart and ambitious, but destined to work on his family’s tea stand. Spotting an opportunity, he learns to drive, masters the flattery that the upper classes expect from their servants, and inveigles himself into a driving job for Ashok (Rajkummar Rao). Balram brings total loyalty to his urbane, US-educated new boss. But loyalty cuts both ways. When Balram is betrayed by his employers, his ingratiating smile curdles, and generations-worth of suppressed anger finally erupts. In contrast to the empathic embrace of Bahrani’s early films (Man Push Cart; Chop Shop), this is harder, more cynical. But we don’t need to warm to the characters to be enthralled by this compulsively watchable class parable. On Netflix",The White Tiger,FILM
Baby Done review – Rose Matafeo carries tinder-dry pregnancy comedy,"A chirpy, good-natured pregnancy comedy from New Zealand, Baby Done is carried by a no-nonsense performance from standup comedian Rose Matafeo. She plays Zoe, a professional tree surgeon who is completely unprepared for her unplanned pregnancy. While her partner, Tim (Harry Potter alumnus Matthew Lewis), embraces the idea of parenthood, Zoe frets over the unfinished adventures on her to-do list. Tinder-dry delivery bolsters the film’s gentle humour, and while the momentum sags a little in the second half, the natural chemistry between Matafeo and Lewis keeps the audience invested and the story relatable.

76 Days review – harrowing account of the incubation of the coronavirus,"Winter 2020 in Wuhan, China: ground zero for the coronavirus epidemic. This urgent fly-on-the-wall documentary, shot in four hospitals during the 76 days of lockdown in Wuhan, shows the “fearless soldiers”, as one grateful patient describes the doctors and nurses, on the frontline of a battle with a then unknown foe. It is, at times, harrowing. The film doesn’t shy away from grief at its rawest, fear at its most paralysing. There are moments – the swollen fingers of an elderly patient clinging to the hand of a stranger invisible behind layers of PPE – that are wrenchingly sad. But crucially, there’s also an element of hope and even humour in this affecting tribute to healthcare workers everywhere. On Dogwoof on Demand and other digital platforms",76 Days,FILM
Synchronic review – tiresome time-travellers going nowhere,"Here is a squawking, gobbling, factory-farmed turkey, and it’s a shame because its co-creators Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead are a film-making duo known for interesting sci-fi horror fantasy. In 2017, they gave us a very intriguing indie movie called The Endless, in which they also starred as two thirtysomething brothers who 10 years previously had been freed from a sinister cult, but make a strange decision to revisit this creepy brotherhood whose world now seems more interesting than their current banal existence. That was a very atmospheric, if confused film. Sadly, all the problems with it seem to have magnified for this muddled and exasperatingly slow and pointless drama. Anthony Mackie and Jamie Dornan play Steve and Dennis, two careworn paramedics in New Orleans having to deal with the casualties of a new synthetic drug called Synchronic with time-travel powers. The problem with “imaginary drug” films is that they’re an easy and unearned route to excitement, and only a very rigorously clear and consistent narrative, and preferably a humorous script, can make them work. Ariel Schulman and Henry Joost’s Project Power (2020) was another imaginary-street-drug-in-New-Orleans film that was successful because of bright performances from a cast headed by Jamie Foxx. Similarly, Neil Burger’s Limitless (2011), with Bradley Cooper’s washed-up loser getting a mega-IQ boost from a brain pill, was viable as raucous satire. But Synchronic is frankly just silly and tedious, with faintly absurd and jeopardy-free time-travel scenes and a dramatic focus hopelessly split between Dennis and Steve’s separate but equally tiresome lives. There is a laugh when Mackie’s exhausted time-traveller comes back to the present and declares to his video diary: “The past fuckin’ sucks, man.” As does so much else. • Synchronic is available on digital platforms from 29 January.",Synchronic,FILM
Beginning review – shocking but shallow tale of religion and bigotry,"This is the much-admired feature debut of Georgian director Dea Kulumbegashvili, part of the official selection for last year’s cancelled Cannes film festival, where it might well have been a shock-cinema talking point had the event gone ahead. It is co-produced by the Mexican film-maker Carlos Reygadas, whose influence is very apparent, and the movie as a whole is an intensely, indeed overbearingly, curated and controlled experience. It is a succession of disquieting tableaux, shot mainly from fixed camera positions in which the relevant action can be happening very far away, and one of the speakers can be off-camera for long periods: a cinema in the high style of Haneke, Farhadi and Kiarostami. Yana (Ia Sukhitashvili) and David (Rati Oneli, the co-writer) are a devout Jehovah’s Witness couple with a child who preside over a newly-built prayer house in a remote community. When a religious meeting is firebombed by bigoted locals, David makes an official complaint to the (equally bigoted) police about their marked lack of effort or interest in finding the culprits, and makes a trip to Tbilisi to discuss matters with community elders. Meanwhile, Yana is left behind and is menaced and assaulted by someone claiming to be a cop. The central rape scene is very disturbingly shot and there is also what I admit is a potent final sequence, imagining some kind of retribution or spiritual degradation happening to the assailant in geological time. But there is something inert and frankly shallow in the film: a refrigerated mannerism in which rape and religious beliefs are both kinds of arthouse artefact, not made any more authentic or compelling by the suggestions of Yana’s own ambiguous attitude to what has just happened. Kulumbegashvili’s style is confident, if derivative. Her technique now has to evolve away from these self-conscious influences. • Beginning is available on Mubi from 29 January.",Beginning,FILM
Josep review – haunting tale of an artist adventurer,"The Spanish illustrator Josep Bartolí lived enough life to fill a dozen epic biopics. He fought against Franco’s fascists and fled over the Pyrenees into France with 500,000 other refugees in early 1939. After escaping from an internment camp, he made his way to Mexico, where he became a lover of Frida Kahlo. In New York, he was friends with Rothko and Pollock, and designed sets for Hollywood – until his name ended up on the blacklist. Now his life has been turned into a film: not an epic, but a slender and haunting French animation focusing on his years as a prisoner in France. It’s the feature debut of Aurélien Froment, best known as a cartoonist for Le Monde where his work appears under the name Aurel. He frames the film with the fictional story of an elderly French man, Serge (voiced by Gérard Hernandez), who’s telling his grandson about his stint as a fresh-faced gendarme working as a guard at an internment camp. We see him as a young man (voiced by Bruno Solo), a gentle soul with a pleasant face. (He reminded me of a Raymond Briggs character.) His colleagues mock him for refusing to abuse prisoners, who are treated more like criminals than refugees. Secretly, Serge makes friends with one of the Spanish, a handsome man with a magnificent hooked nose, who is constantly drawing – scribbling pictures on cutlery, walls, in the dirt with his finger. He is Bartolí (Sergí Lopez). Aurel draws scenes inside the camp in a grim camouflage of greys and dust browns, and shows us Bartolí’s angry, Goya-like drawings of the horrors: prisoners’ faces ravaged by disease and hunger, contorted with despair. Often the image remains still, the characters’ expressions and movements static – frozen like memories fixed in the brain after all these years. It’s a delicate, thoughtful film, moving and real. Not utterly bleak either, ending with a rampage of colour and life in Mexico – and a brilliantly sweary cameo from Kahlo. • Josep is available on Mubi from 28 January.",Josep,FILM
Spike Lee compares Donald Trump to Hitler,"Spike Lee has likened Donald Trump to Hitler in an acceptance speech at a film critics awards show, adding that “the whole world is laughing at the United States”. The director made his comments when he accepted a special award from the New York Film Critics Circle for his short film New York, New York. The film was released in May 2020 and Lee described it as a “love letter to its people”. Lee said the comments about the Trump were recorded on 6 January, the day of the Capitol breach, which he said was “a very sad day in the history of America”. “We are living in a very serious time in America,” said the director. “His president, President Agent Orange, will go down in history with the likes of Hitler … all his boys, they are going down on the wrong side of history.” Lee has a history of sparring with Trump, including calling him a “motherfucker” over Trump’s response to the 2017 Charlotteville protests, during which activist Heather Heyer was murdered by white supremacist James Fields. Trump accused him of a “racist hit on your president” after an earlier acceptance speech by Lee at the 2019 Oscars.",Spike Lee,FILM-CREW
"A Ghost Waits review – haunting, heartwarming romcom","Chock full of delightful narrative surprises, imaginative genre tweaks, and warming performances from its two leads, this low-budget romcom-horror story is worth seeking out. Director Adam Stovall, who co-wrote the script with the film’s star MacLeod Andrews, makes an impressive feature debut with an obviously teensy budget. It’s smartly deployed to cover essentially one set, some theatrical makeup and kit for some fetching black-and-white cinematography that simultaneously recalls vintage-era spooky movies of the 30s as well as too-cool-for-school early Jim Jarmusch films such as Stranger Than Paradise. Andrews’ protagonist Jack is a handyman who works for a property management company. His job is to check over houses for damage and do some light cleaning after tenants move out. However, it looks as if the former residents of an ordinary looking, two-storey suburban house left in a hurry, leaving all their possessions behind; Jack’s boss wants him to find out why so many previous clients similarly skipped out in a rush. Turns out it’s because the place is haunted by Muriel (Natalie Walker), a “spectral agent”, as she insists on being called, who has felt a particular sense of ownership over the building for many years. At first, Jack doesn’t even notice the doors opening by themselves or the lights turning on, but eventually Muriel gets his attention and makes herself visible; the two discover a spiritual affinity of sorts, that grows into a friendship and more. Like Tim Burton’s Beetlejuice, the script’s world-building posits a kind of afterlife bureaucracy in charge of hauntings, albeit one that seems to have gone through a very 21st-century style rebranding that has banished use of the word “ghost”. Muriel is a respected worker, but her boss, officious desk ghoul Ms Henry (Amanda Miller), is determined to undermine her and puts another co-worker (Sydney Vollmer) on the case as well. All of this ensures the film is not in the least bit scary, and clears room emotionally for a conclusion that’s as weird as it is apt and genuinely moving. Choice musical cuts from Honeyhoney, the Bengsons and Wussy further enhance the film’s insouciant street cred. • A Ghost Waits is released on the Arrow player in the UK, US and Canada on 1 February.",A Ghost Waits,FILM
Summer of '72 review – tame boy-meets-psychiatric-patient romance,"“She might be crazy, or she might be the sanest person I’ve ever met.” Some cringingly obvious lines really lower the tone of this deep south melodrama (released in the US last year with the title Tuscaloosa). It’s an adaptation of Glasgow Phillips’s novel about a white kid in early-70s Alabama: a psychiatrist’s son, he falls in love with one of his dad’s patients. The director is Philip Harder, a veteran music promo maker who evokes time and place with the intoxicatingly intense colour and heightened reality of a William Eggleston photograph. But his film, though well-meaning, is disappointingly tame and soap opera-ish. What it has got going for it is a trio of gusty, heart-on-sleeve performances. Devon Bostick is terrific as Billy, a charismatic dope-smoking drop-out who’s back home in Alabama mooching about, working as a gardener at his dad’s psychiatric hospital. One day, he spots beautiful new inpatient Virginia (Natalia Dyer), who tells him she’s not crazy and that her dad locked her up for being a nymphomaniac. Dyer’s intelligent and sensitive performance does wonders for a character who, on the page, looks like a male fantasy: a cool-girl psychiatric case, fun-loving, free-spirited and up for anything. Marchánt Davis completes the trio as Nigel, Billy’s African American childhood friend. He joins a group of militant civil rights activists and becomes the target of racist cops, but there’s just too much going on to properly explore the dynamics of the two men’s friendship. Another subplot in flashback reveals the death in mysterious circumstances of Billy’s mother when he was a child – a storyline that seems to exist purely to fend off criticism that here we have a film about brutal racism and oppression of women told from the perspective of a privileged white man. • Summer of ’72 is available on digital platforms from 1 February.",Summer of '72,FILM
Disney removes 'negative depictions of native peoples' from Jungle Cruise ride,"Disney is to overhaul its Jungle Cruise theme park attraction to remove what it describes as “negative depictions of native peoples” and to “reflect and value the diversity of the world around us”. The changes were outlined in a blogpost on its Disney Parks website, which included concept art for the redesigned attraction, a simulated riverboat ride originally developed for Disneyland when it opened in California in 1955. It has since been replicated in Disney theme parks in Florida, Tokyo and Hong Kong. In a statement quoted by USA Today, Disney added that its designers “are addressing negative depictions of native people while adding a humorous storyline … this group of adventurers [will] be diverse – in background and fields of interest”. Partly inspired by the 1951 film The African Queen, Jungle Cruise has long been a target of criticism for its inclusion of caricatures of indigenous people as well as a character, Trader Sam, who offers “heads” for sale. A post by design group Thinkwell calls elements of the attraction “horrifyingly racist”. Disney’s redesign of the Jungle Cruise follows its decision, announced in June 2020, to rework its Splash Mountain attraction. Originally inspired by the now repudiated 1946 film Song of the South, Splash Mountain is being modelled on its 2009 animation, The Princess and the Frog, the first to contain an African American princess. A film version of Jungle Cruise, starring Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt, has had its release delayed until July 2021.",Disney,FILM-CREW
God of the Piano review – icy family drama is a virtuoso debut,"A classical pianist gives birth to a hearing-impaired son in Israeli director Itay Tal’s impressive feature debut. You could interpret his film as an allegory of tiger parenting and other child-raising techniques with gimmicky names. And the script raises all sorts of questions about whether talent is innate, how far it is influenced by genes, and whether it needs to be developed while young. Tal refrigerates these questions into an elegant and disturbing family drama that has echoes of Michael Haneke: it’s a film with a shard of ice lodged in its heart. Naama Preis is the pregnant pianist, Anat, who is on stage when her waters break. Not missing a beat, she carries on playing, amniotic fluid trickling into her shoe. At the hospital, routine tests reveal that her baby son is deaf – further investigations will be needed. I watched what Anat does next with my hands covering my face; it is a heart-stopping moment of scary-but-not-scary cinema. The story then skips ahead a few years. Anat has given up the piano to focus on moulding her son, Idam, into a musical prodigy. He performs in public for the first time aged seven or so. Later, there’s an unbearably tense scene as he sits down at 12 to play in front of the wider family after dinner. All of them are pianists, and musical greatness is the only measure of success. Anat’s father, a well-known composer, demanding and severe, is hypercritical of the boy’s technique. Through all of this Anat’s face is inscrutable, impossible to read. Is she numbed by guilt or has being raised in this toxic environment warped her self-esteem and sense of family life? Another director would insert epic meltdowns here, but Tal keeps things cool and collected – and his supremely satisfying film gets the job done in 80 minutes. • Available on Your Screen.",God of the Piano,FILM
Cannes film festival officially delayed from May until July,"Cannes 2021 just got hotter. The annual film festival, which prides itself on launching the premieres – and careers – of some of the world’s top directors, will now take place at the height of summer, following concerns over the Covid pandemic. The festival had been scheduled to take place from 11-22 May; now it will run from 6-17 July. “As announced last autumn, the Festival de Cannes reserved the right to change its dates depending on how the global health situation developed,” explained a press release on Wednesday. Variety had reported last week that July was the most likely choice, with organisers extremely keen to host a physical edition of the festival after last year’s was called off following a series of postponements. Holding the event in July would mean that Cannes retains more than a month’s head start on the autumn festivals: Venice, Telluride and Toronto, which begin in late August. The Cannes Lions advertising festival is scheduled to take place as planned in the city’s Palais des Festivals in June. Local hoteliers were reported to be positive about the change as their hopes of a normal tourist season this year rapidly diminished. The event usually attracts some 200,000 visitors to the Riviera hotspot, generating an estimated 200m euros’ (£176m) worth of economic benefits for the area. Cannes general delegate Thierry Frémaux had mooted the idea of extending the festival’s length due to the likelihood of a backlog of high-quality films delayed by the pandemic; this appears to have ditched. After the festival was cancelled in 2020, Frémaux presented a selection of more than 50 films, including Wes Anderson’s as-yet-unreleased The French Dispatch, Pixar animation Soul, which premiered on streaming platform Disney+ in December, and Lovers Rock and Mangrove from Steve McQueen’s Small Axe anthology for the BBC. Premieres at the 2019 edition included Parasite, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Pain and Glory, Sorry We Missed You and Portrait of a Lady on Fire. The Sundance film festival begins later this week in a wholly virtual format. The Berlin film festival, which is normally in February, will now take place in two stages: digital only in March and physical in June.",Cannes 2021,OTHERS
Twist review – try-hard reboot spray paints over Dickens' tale,"Michael Caine already has the distinction of appearing in what many believe is the greatest Dickens adaptation of all time: The Muppets Christmas Carol, in which he played Scrooge. Now he is Fagin in this try-hard modern reboot of Oliver Twist, in which the plot and indeed meaning of the original has been jettisoned, leaving few of the characters – though the original’s tiny, sticky-fingered tealeaves are now promoted to supercool young adulthood. It never really comes to life and there’s a kids-TV feel to most of it, although the free-running scenes are watchable enough, and Caine’s disguise as a grumpy Russian plutocrat with a fake moustache raises some laughs. Rafferty Law (the dead spit of his dad, Jude Law) plays Twist, a young graffiti artist who gets roped into street crime and finds himself hanging out with some cheeky but nonviolent young chancers in Fagin’s employ: a gender-switched Dodge (Rita Ora), and a character called Red (Sophie Simnett), who is in an abusive relationship with another gender-switched character, Sikes, played by Lena Headey. Caine’s Fagin turns out to be a former art dealer ruined by an unscrupulous competitor (enjoyably played by David Walliams), so Fagin plans an elaborate robbery to get his own back on this absolute rotter. And so we are in caper-theft territory, with people disguising themselves as police officers, lowering themselves into lifts from a hole in a ceiling, spray painting over CCTV cameras and pinching Old Masters. Noel Clarke and Jason Maza are Brownlow and Bedwin, the flat-footed coppers on Twist’s trail, but hardly able to keep up with his parkour shenanigans. This movie’s not unlikable, but the action and comedy are under par. • Twist is released on Sky Cinema on 29 January.",Twist,FILM
The Capote Tapes review – inside the iconic writer's ice-cold mind,"There’s a necrophiliac fascination to this documentary about the life and times of Truman Capote, author of the 1958 novella Breakfast at Tiffany’s – filmed with Audrey Hepburn – and the true-crime reportage masterpiece In Cold Blood from 1966. The latter was about the brutal slaying of a Kansas farming family in which the cold-bloodedness of the crime was matched by the cold-bloodedness of Capote’s literary and journalistic performance – befriending the culprits with prison visits and privately agitating for their death penalty to give his book a sensational ending. If anyone had the splinter of ice in the heart that Graham Greene said a novelist needed, it was him. Capote was also a gay man in an era when being one was dangerous, but when those prominent in the arts could hide it in plain sight with extravagant mannerisms. Norman Mailer admired his courage and I found myself thinking of a German word invented by the English writer Ben Schott: schmetterlingsschnauze, or “butterfly jaws” – the toughness of the dandy. This film from Ebs Burnough, based on a cache of audiotaped interviews with Capote’s intimates made by Paris Review editor George Plimpton, is chiefly about the strange case of Capote’s unfinished novel, Answered Prayers. This was his anatomy of the New York idle rich with whom Capote mingled and for whom he threw the supposedly legendary Black and White Ball in New York in 1966, a bafflingly iconic event whose guest list – like the cast of people on whom Answered Prayers is based – now seems mostly like a pageant of wealthy mediocrities and Eurotrash narcissists. Maybe Capote’s novel-fragment attacking them was intended as the definitive, contemptuous dismissal: a final flick of the switch on the electric chair. But the contempt was surely also for himself. When a few chapters were published, it apparently lost him some A-lister friends, though he gained new ones to hang out with at Studio 54 in the 70s, including his acolyte Andy Warhol – who was really Capote’s cultural heir in the new age of celebrity. (This film could have said more about their relationship.) It is salutary to be reminded of a great writer, whose heyday was at a time when literary authors were at the centre of culture.

The Queen of Black Magic review – derivative gross-out horror,"Leaving their home in Jakarta, well-to-do dad Hanif (Ario Bayu), his wife Nadya (Hannah Al Rashid) and their three kids drive to the remote rural orphanage where Hanif grew up. At first, it’s all laughs and backseat bickering – until the car hits something. Having established that the collision was with a now dead deer, they drive off, only for the camera to reveal that the real victim was a child, now dead in a ditch. Up comes the title card, by which point viewers of this Indonesian horror will have some inkling that The Queen of Black Magic isn’t going to mess around. After this unnerving first 10 minutes, there is a long expository lull as an unwieldy cast of characters is introduced. These include the two guys Hanif was best friends with back at the orphanage, their wives, enigmatic servants, two of the current teenage residents, and the dying old man who ran the place. Eventually, after a couple of creepy anecdotes about demons and madwomen locked in bedrooms, the action finally kicks in with a pretty unrelenting stream of horror. Possessions by unquiet spirits result in regurgitated caterpillars, millipedes in eye sockets, someone getting their mouth stapled shut, a woman with an eating disorder mutilating her body, and a bus full of corpses. Then it gets really nasty. Director Kimo Stamboel deploys some clever visual effects and trick camera angles to heighten the gross-out factor – a twist reveals the agent of chaos isn’t just cruel but seeking justice for historical abuse. But ultimately it is all a bit repetitive, derivative (particularly of other Asian horror pics) and somewhat sleep-inducing. • The Queen of Black Magic is available on Shudder from 29 January.",The Queen of Black Magic,FILM
Assassins review – the 'prank show' killing of North Korea's pretender,"Nothing to do with the 1990 musical by Stephen Sondheim about the people throughout history who have tried to kill the US president … yet maybe this film should itself be turned into a musical or opera. It is a documentary about the extraordinary 2017 assassination of Kim Jong-nam, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s half-brother, who had been living in exile in China and was not merely a persistent critic of the regime but seen as a possible alternative ruler. Bizarrely, Kim Jong-nam was killed by having VX nerve agent smeared in his face in Kuala Lumpur international airport’s departure hall by two young women, Siti Aisyah and Doan Thi Houng – from Indonesia and Vietnam respectively – who had been duped by North Korean agents posing as TV producers into thinking they were filming a hidden-camera prank show. The Malaysian government quickly and timidly allowed the North Koreans to go free when the regime effectively held Malaysian embassy staff hostage with their families in Pyongyang. So that left the two vulnerable young women facing a mandatory death penalty for murder, just so the Malaysian legal system could indict someone and save face. It is a gripping story, well told by documentary film-maker Ryan White, with the help of two journalists who covered it at the time: Bloomberg reporter Hadi Azmi and the Washington Post’s former Beijing bureau chief Anna Fifield. There is something genuinely chilling about the way the North Koreans groomed and gaslit their two young victims, making them do dozens of supposed pranks on people over many months, with regular payment and spurious reassurance: eerie dummy-run stunts, just to get them used to the technique. Aisyah and Huong were manipulated like young women being sex-trafficked and, in the strangest, unknowing way, like jihadis being schooled for a big attack. (The nerve-agent element has an extra resonance for the UK after the Russians’ novichok outrage in Salisbury in 2018.) Only the state has access to chemical weapons, and their use is designed to send a sickening message of triumphalism and nationalism. What an extraordinary story of sexism, violence, diplomatic bad faith and dishonesty on an international scale. One question remains: who had the bizarre yet satanically clever idea of a fake prank show? And how is it that the North Koreans, supposedly marooned in their Soviet past, managed to dream up something dripping with contemporary media irony? It could be down to a certain mysterious Japanese national who was identified as an accomplice, but never tracked down. Perhaps a true-crime podcast should now be devoted to finding him. • Assassins is available on digital platforms from 29 January.",Assassins,FILM

George Clooney joins reboot of classic sci-fi series Buck Rogers,"George Clooney could be heading to outer space once more after it was announced he had joined the team putting together a reboot of the classic sci-fi series Buck Rogers. The Hollywood Reporter writes that the project, written by Under the Dome’s Brian K Vaughan, could be a “starring vehicle” for Clooney, who will be executive producer of the series. The character Buck Rogers is a war veteran who falls into a coma and wakes up in the 25th century. After the success of a late 70s film a TV series followed starring Gil Gerard, as the US army air corps officer, and Erin Gray. Rogers first appeared in the 1920s before becoming a comic book mainstay in the 1930s, with early radio, TV and film adaptations, all before 1950. Clooney is in the awards race for another post-apocalyptic sci-fi project in the guise of Netflix’s The Midnight Sky. He has joined the project as executive producer, alongside his Smokehouse Pictures partner Grant Heslov, while Flint Dille – the grandson of the original Buck Rogers publisher, John F Dille – will produce. There have been aborted attempts to revive the Rogers franchise, with Frank Miller, the Sin City comic book writer turned film-maker, announcing in 2008 he was working on a film adaptation of the story, but it has never seen the light of day. Earlier reports said the reboot would go back to the character’s first appearance in the 1928 story, Armageddon 2419 AD, where Rogers is introduced as a first world war soldier trapped by a cave-in while investigating strange phenomena in an abandoned Pennsylvania coalmine. In the story, Rogers is exposed to radioactive gas and wakes up nearly 500 years later in the 25th century and helps a resistance force attempt to retake the US, which has been taken over by a conquering force. The original 1970s TV show has been part of a boom in nostalgia-fuelled streaming during the pandemic. It forms part of the lineup on Forces TV, the commercial arm of the British Forces Broadcasting Service, a charity that provides TV and radio for members of the armed forces.",George Clooney,FILM-CREW
Beginning review – a Jehovah's Witness under attack in Georgia,"Georgian writer-director Dea Kulumbegashvili’s fierce feature debut, about a Jehovah’s Witness whose faith is tested, opens with an act of hostility. The camera observes from a fixed point at the back of a Kingdom Hall as the space fills and blinds are eventually drawn. Minutes into the service, someone throws a firebomb into the room. The camera continues to watch as flames start to spread. Beginning centres on Yana (Ia Sukhitashvili), former actress and dutiful wife of congregation leader David (Rati Oneli, who co-wrote the film). Yana must navigate both her domineering husband and Alex (Kakha Kintsurashvili), a dangerous man who insists he is a police detective from Tbilisi. Kulumbegashvili draws parallels between the local contempt for Jehovah’s Witnesses – a religious minority in the Georgian mountain town of Lagodekhi – and a broader patriarchal contempt for women. Sukhitashvili’s subtle performance brings interiority to a character who might otherwise be defined entirely by her suffering. The director favours a static camera and extended takes that give her compositions a holy quality. The length of certain scenes feels confrontational, not unlike Chantal Akerman’s long takes in her 1975 feminist classic Jeanne Dielman, 23, quai du commerce, 1080 Bruxelles. Through this rigorous aesthetic, a distinctive point of view emerges. An act of sexual violence takes place in a setting of natural beauty – a babbling brook flanked by wildflowers. The juxtaposition feels like a provocation. • On Mubi",Beginning,FILM
Assassins review – who were the women who killed Kim Jong-un's brother?,"In February 2017, at Kuala Lumpur airport, two young women smeared the deadly chemical agent VX across the face of Kim Jong-nam, estranged half-brother of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. He died less than 20 minutes later. CCTV footage of the incident shows one of them wearing a white top emblazoned with the phrase LOL. According to their lawyers, the pair thought they were competing in a YouTube prank show. Perhaps wisely, Ryan White’s slick documentary chooses not to mine the bizarre scene for comic potential. Instead, he spins the arrest of Siti Aisyah and Doan Thi Huong – economic migrants from Indonesia and Vietnam respectively – into a parable about political corruption. • On multiple platforms",Assassins,FILM
Palmer review – Justin Timberlake dominates modest family drama,"Former American football star Palmer (Justin Timberlake) has just been released from a 12-year stint in prison. It’s a shock, then, when he ends up having to care for a bullied young boy (Ryder Allen) in this modest family drama. Allen is a little cutesy as Sam, who is obsessed with fairies, dolls and dresses. Still, the film’s treatment of a gender-nonconforming character is clear-eyed. Timberlake can certainly act (see his turn in The Social Network), but the role of hardened, monosyllabic Palmer isn’t a neat fit. The showy singer turned actor struggles to modulate his natural charisma, a flirtatious, extroverted energy repeatedly leaking out where it should be muffled. • On Apple TV",Palmer,FILM
Rival GameStop movies being rushed into production,"The GameStop content race is on, even as the Reddit-fueled market rebellion against billionaire hedge funds continues to play out in real time. Netflix is reportedly in talks to ink a film adaptation of the social media David v Goliath saga, in which a small army of online investors upended Wall Street by driving up the prices of shares in the ailing video game chain and other shorted companies, with Mark Boal (Zero Dark Thirty, The Hurt Locker) set to write and To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before’s Noah Centineo attached to star. The as-yet-untitled project would be the second adaptation of the merely two-weeks-old GameStop saga already in development, after MGM acquired rights in a bidding war last week to the book proposal The Antisocial Network by Ben Mezrich, the author of The Accidental Billionaires, which served as source material for The Social Network. That adaptation is set to be produced by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, both played by Armie Hammer in David Fincher’s drama. An auction for the book itself will begin this month. According to Deadline, which broke the news, sources claim the Netflix project would use the recent market frenzy, in which a motley crew of Reddit users and amateur investors targeted billionaire hedge funds’ short-selling bets and sent GameStop stocks surging 135% on a single day, to explore the broader cultural shifts, for good and ill, as social media has leveled the playing field and overruled former gatekeepers. The film will reportedly cover the GameStop saga as well as the proliferation of misinformation on social media and intentionally disseminated disinformation on election fraud, which propelled the pro-Trump assault on the US Capitol earlier this month. This is not the first time Boal has incorporated real-time developments into a fast-track screenplay; following the news that US Navy Seals had killed Osama bin Laden in a 2011 raid in Pakistan, Boal and his directing partner, Kathryn Bigelow, quickly adapted a long-gestating project on the hunt for the al-Qaida leader into Zero Dark Thirty, a thriller on controversial US intelligence techniques and the successful raid.",GameStop,OTHERS
Running Naked review – feelgood cancer comedy with teen pranks,"This awkward British feelgood cancer comedy by director Victor Buhler never entirely comes together, switching from serious to silly and not exactly comfortable in either tone or register. What Running Naked has got going for it are two likable supporting performances by Samuel Bottomley and James Senneck as Mark and Ben, teenage cancer patients who meet in a Manchester hospital. Bored and terrified, they make mischief on the wards. (There’s a funny scene in which they make a break for it, reaching as far as the carpark before realising there’s nowhere to go, and skulk back to their beds.) Skip ahead 15 years, and the film is on shakier ground. Now in their 30s, Mark and Ben (played by Matthew McNulty and Andrew Gower, respectively) survived but live with an increased risk of developing cancer as adults. Mark is a doctor on the same ward where the pair were treated as lads. He’s the more successful of the two, but is held back emotionally by a nagging fear that bad things happen to him. So he laddishly dumps the love of his life, fellow doctor Jade (Rakhee Thakrar), before anything goes wrong with the relationship. Still, he’s loyal to his old mate Ben. Grownup Ben is more problematic. He’s dweeby, anaemic-looking and wears a terrible cardboard-coloured suit – imagine Jarvis Cocker playing Mr Bean. Since remission he has suffered from hygiene-related obsessive behaviours, and there is something questionable in the way his struggles get played for laughs. The script here is unkind and unfunny, and perhaps actually backfires, since many of us can now relate to applying hand sanitiser every five minutes. The plot hinges on a twist you can see coming for miles; this is one of those Britfilms with a sitcom feel. It might have worked better over four or five episodes with sharpening of the script – and more teenage pranks. • Available from 8 February on digital formats.",Running Naked,FILM
Clementine review – lakeside retreat harbours damp passions,"There is some interesting material in Clementine, but it is an indulgent mood piece, unfocused and unfinished, and one that feels like an idea for a short film, but stretched out to feature length. Otmara Marrero plays Karen, a woman deeply hurt at being dumped by her older, wealthier lover D (Sonya Walger), who has moreover kept Karen’s beloved dog, Ramsey. In an angry, confused and vengeful mood, Karen drives to D’s beautiful lake house, where they had spent so much blissful time together, and breaks in – just to hang out, or somehow to assert herself. But here she encounters Lana (Sydney Sweeney), a disconcertingly smart, beautiful woman sunbathing by the lake, and a weirdly intense relationship develops between the two of them. Exasperatingly, we are asked to stay tuned for long periods of time while the sexual tension between Karen and Lana smoulders inconclusively away, but then the dramatic focus lurches over to Beau (Will Brittain), a hunky guy who has come to do odd jobs around the lake house, but may be spying on Karen on D’s behalf, and may have designs on Lana. Then he, too, is upstaged in the toxic male sexual danger department by some creepy guys Lana knows, claiming to have contacts in the LA movie business. They have a video camera at their place and give innocent Lana an “audition”. Afterwards, this is the subject of an actor-ish monologue by Lana, which itself feels like an audition piece. (It certainly should go on Sydney Sweeney’s showreel.) Where are we going with all this? Nowhere very satisfying: there is a lot of non-suspense leading to non-thrills and non-revelation of character. The performancesby Marrero and Sweeney, though, are perfectly fair. • Released on digital formats on 8 February.",Clementine,FILM
Winter Flies review – teen tearaways ride their luck with a smile,"Winter Flies’ two teen runaways, as they make a break across country in their hot-wired Audi, are prone to spontaneously breaking out in incredulous laughter; that’s the guiding spirit of this unforced, inquisitive and winningly optimistic Czech road movie. There’s a hint of unspecified family troubles in their rear-view mirror, but the underage drivers – blasé loverman Mará (Tomáš Mrvík) and rotund Heduš (Jan František Uher) – are more focused on heading anywhere-but-here. Recounted in cross-cut flashback from the police station where Mará is being interrogated on his own (with Heduš’s fate unknown), the duo use the journey time to trade their obsessions: joining the Foreign Legion, sleeping-bag protocol, Mará’s supposed military hotshot granddad and, of course, getting laid. These kind of semi-delusional adolescent hobbyhorses could have ended up as a Superbad-style gag-fest, but Slovenian director Olmo Omerzu patiently teases out a subtler humour and pathos. Nuzzling tightly to the actors’ perspective, Omerzu in his third feature comes close to the kind of miraculous naturalness Hirokazu Kore-eda achieves in his films. Mará proves to have a tender centre, something first relayed when he saves a dog from drowning. There’s an initial suggestion that he may be an unreliable narrator, and Mrvík, pink-cheeked but with a testy gaze, holds the screen with star conviction. But the film finally has no heart for any guile and remains beautifully sincere. In one sequence, Mará falls asleep at the wheel, and the car appears to be driving itself down a snow-streaked Czech highway, as if on the momentum of insolent bravado and the innocence of dreams. • Available from 29 January via YourScreen. • This article was amended on 8 February 2021 to correct the main image credit information.",Winter Flies,FILM
Eye for an Eye review – Travolta goes sleuthing in Texas,"John Travolta stars in this ridiculous and mostly boring hardboiled thriller (AKA The Poison Rose), playing a private detective investigating the disappearance of a woman from a psychiatric hospital. The web of interlinked crimes he unravels barely makes any sense and there are some epically pointless plot twists – one left me so baffled that I wondered if I might’ve momentarily nodded off and missed a scene. It’s a film with no energy, not much pace and few signs of life. It’s exhausting to watch. Travolta goes beyond “world-weary” to give an almost vegetative performance as Carson Phillips, a PI in the poker-playing, bourbon-drinking tradition. In his youth, Phillips was the star quarterback on the local football team but skipped town after a scandal. Back in Texas for the first time in a couple of decades, he gets short shrift at the hospital where the patient has vanished. The doctor in charge (Brendan Fraser) shiftily evades his inquiries and the nurses shoot each other alarmed looks. Morgan Freeman plays casino owner Doc, the richest man in town and clearly not to be trusted. (Like everyone else here, Freeman puts his feet up, taking a breather from doing decent acting.) Wouldn’t you know, it turns out the town is riddled with crime, corrupt to the core. Phillips repeatedly drawls on the voiceover that he’s a sucker for a beautiful woman with a sob story – so inevitably one of the dead bodies is linked to his teenage sweetheart whose daughter (played by the actor’s daughter Ella Bleu Travolta) is accused of murder. It’s a preposterous plot, with a damp-squib ending, and like an episode of Dallas, the dialogue gets phonier and phonier. “This is a bad place. Far worse than you can imagine.” Ditto the film. • Released on 5 February on Amazon Prime Video.",Eye for an Eye,FILM
A Nightmare Wakes review – Mary Shelley battles her inner monsters,"Here is an earnestly intended psychological drama about Mary Shelley, and her relationship with Percy Bysshe Shelley, Byron, Polidori and Claire Clairmont during that legendary summer in 1816 on Lake Geneva when Byron challenged everyone to write a ghost story – and Mary conceived of Frankenstein, so commercially outpacing the literary alpha males and anticipating the modern world in ways far beyond them. The film’s drama centres on the trauma of her pregnancy and childbirth, yoking together the ideas of her dark imagination with pre- and postpartum depression, as well as the patriarchal male-author myth – Percy is shown being threatened by Mary’s creativity and sensuality. It is an idealistic and heartfelt film, but also precious and self-conscious with some pretty callow performances, like a student production at the Edinburgh fringe. What it also appears sometimes to be doing is making a play for some old-fashioned horror scares, in honour of Mary Shelley’s enduring creation, with periodic hallucinatory flashes of Mary (Alix Wilton Regan) looking as she perhaps imagines herself to be – gaunt and monstrous and demonic, approaching a kind of emotional breakdown. But the film can’t quite make up its mind if it wants us to surrender to out-and-out genre thrills, or if we should be taking a step back and responding on a loftier literary-historical level, considering the sexual politics that lay behind the production and consumption of the Frankenstein myth. Philippe Bowgen is a ridiculous and roistering Byron, often shown with his shirt half-off, sensuous, anarchically laughing and wine-quaffing, while Giullian Yao Gioiello is a blandly unsympathetic Percy Shelley. It’s a dry and somewhat lifeless tableau. • Released on 4 February on Shudder.",A Nightmare Wakes,FILM
Birds (Or How to Be One) review – flighty avian-themed drama-doc,"Two-thirds of the way into this experimental Greek docu-fiction, one of the wandering souls featured – apparently watching footage from the film – loses his rag. “This is not about birds. It’s about us being crazy as loons. Come on Babis, I’m a customer here, too, I need to understand.” With director Babis Makridis showing all the confrontational strangeness of the Greek new wave here, the exasperation is understandable. What Makridis has cobbled together is a poetic and initially utopian manifesto for self-liberation inspired by Aristophanes’ play The Birds, in which a king transforms into a hoopoe. In nine chapters with titles such as “Find your voice” and “Take off, land”, Makridis quizzes the characters in poker-faced interview setups about their hopes of becoming birds, and observes these avian wannabes as they make strange fluttering calls on urban streets and roam stark landscapes in search of their inspiration, “Mr Hoopoe” – all intercut with performance excerpts from Aristophanes. The precise significance of all this remains up in the clouds with the aerobatic planes he marvels at; although the assemblage starts to drum up an almost shamanistic mania as people perfect their bespoke bird caws and incant against a lightning-blasted cityscape. Perhaps the lack of easy graspability is trying to jar us into a similar consciousness shift, to get modern society soaring above its current disillusionment. Whether this utopia is psychological or social, it quickly recedes; the mood darkens. Makridis takes us to a grillhouse to illustrate lines from Aristophanes about the indignities visited on birds. “Then they stuff their entire hands into your innards, and they tear out your heart, your spleen and your little liver.” Someone rants about avian aspirations offending the gods. By this point, Makridis’s melding of his elements has become a bit lumpen, and his own self-referential cameo in the film after a cast member complains – breaking the generally forthright mood – seems almost an admission he is losing control of his message. This metamorphosis is only semi-achieved. • Birds (Or How to Be One) is on Mubi from 8 February.",Birds (Or How to Be One),FILM
Modern Persuasion review – Austen in Manhattan is a load of old bonnets,"Do we need a defensive ring of steel petticoats erected around Jane Austen’s novels – something, anything to stop them being updated into perky formulaic romcoms like this? Modern Persuasion is, to state the obvious, a modern version of Austen’s last (and arguably best) novel Persuasion: the story of Anne Elliot, who at 27 – still a mere slip of a girl – is staring down the barrel of spinsterdom. Eight years earlier she made the terrible mistake of turning down an offer of marriage from a penniless naval officer. The film-makers have meticulously transferred the book’s characters and plotting – and, to be fair, some of its warmth – to modern-day New York. But lost in adaptation is any trace of Austen’s wit and razor-sharp satire. That said, Alicia Witt brings several shreds of dignity to the role of single gal Wren Cosgrove, a highly-flying PR exec living in New York with her cat. The boyfriend she never got over is her college ex Owen (Shane McRae, performing with the charisma of a wardrobe). After graduation, Wren refused to move to San Francisco with him. Now he’s a tech billionaire; though pointedly not a douchebag since his new project is a charity-giving app. When the pair accidentally meet up again – after he hires her firm to do his PR – Owen acts frostily like they’re strangers. Instead he flirts with Wren’s two young assistants (nicely played as irritating yet endearing by Daniella Pineda and Tedra Millan). Here the script misses a trick; it could have mimicked Austen, skewering the social hypocrisy of men marrying younger women while women of the same age are deemed to be mothballed – plus ça change. But instead the film mostly satirises the assistants’ aggressively millennial social media abbreviations – impenetrable to the oldies. Still, the biggest crime against Austen, and the film’s fundamental flaw, is turning woman-of-substance Anne Elliot into yet another romcom thirtysomething cat lady sighing dreamily at the Manhattan skyline while waiting for Mr Right. • Modern Persuasion is on digital platforms from 8 February.",Modern Persuasion,FILM
The Recce review – crossing enemy lines in South African action-drama,"This South African-made action-drama unfolds against the background of a conflict little known about above the equator, much less used as a setting for film – the Namibian war of independence from 1966-90, AKA the South African border war. Often considered South Africa’s version of Vietnam, it was, among other things, a proxy fight between South Africa, then still under apartheid, and its allies at the time, and the People’s Liberation Army of Namibia, who were backed by the Soviet Union and Cuba. Although there’s a fair amount of on-screen contextualising in the opening minutes to explain key terms and ideas, The Recce feels made for a local audience that has a grasp of the cultural and historical background. That means it’s not easy for outsiders to read the ideology of this stylised, fictional account of an elite Afrikaner soldier, Henk Viljoen (Greg Kriek), the “recce”, who is ordered to go across enemy lines alone one last time to kill a Russian officer. Henk leaves behind his pregnant wife Nicola (Christia Visser), with whom we spend a lot of screen time as she looks anxious, remembers happier moments in her marriage and visits Henk’s parents, who are sick with worry about their son. In the narrative mix is Captain Le Roux (Grant Swanby), an English-speaking South African officer who is also worried about Henk and the general madness of the war. All three have internal monologues where we hear their poetic musings as the visuals show slow-motion action, often backlit with the blazing African sun, or drinking in the vast, awe-inspiring landscape. I’m guessing writer-director Johannes Ferdinand Van Zyl has been huffing Terrence Malick movies, particularly the ones about sensitive manly types, such as The Thin Red Line and The Tree of Life. At any moment you expect Kriek to do a magical backflip in slo-mo as the soundtracks keens mournfully and magic hour breaks across the bush. The characters of colour, such as the many indigenous people Henk shoots on his way in and out of Angola, don’t get to share their thoughts in dreamy voiceovers, which smacks more of oversight rather than overt racism. Nevertheless, the end result feels limited and ultimately a little pointless. • The Recce is available on digital platforms from 8 February.",The Recce,FILM
Bliss review – epically bad acting in tiresome sci-fi fantasy,"There is some epically bad acting in this silly and tiresome sci-fi fantasy-mystery from writer-director Mike Cahill, whose renowned debut Another Earth in 2011 left me sceptical, yet intrigued. But this is a conceited mess, which almost from the very first frame tips you off that we are heading for some version of the time-honoured cheat/twist ending that has – admittedly – been with cinema since its earliest days and attracted some of the biggest directorial names. Owen Wilson plays Greg, a stressed and ill-looking guy who is working in a call centre firm called Technical Difficulties, the job being to help people on the phone with their problems. He has a corner office, so is presumably a big cheese. But Greg is slacking off, more concerned with doodling some dream city of his own imagination. He also has a strained relationship with his grownup daughter Emily (Nesta Cooper), who is about to graduate from college. Greg is estranged from Emily’s mother and talks about having “messed up”. But after a calamitous confrontation with his boss, he winds up in a scuzzy bar where he meets a Manic Pixie Grownup Tramp Woman called Isabel, played with unbearably peculiar mannerisms by Salma Hayek. Isabel red-pills Greg about the false nature of the universe: it’s all a digitally created illusion apparently – digitally created by Isabel, in fact – and now Greg is going to discover the truth, just as he is in full, traumatised retreat from the emotional pain in his personal life. Every syllable of action, as we grind towards the broadly guessable finish, is jeopardy-free and interest-free. Wilson looks as if he is thinking about something else: the halting sing-song rhythms of his voice sound vapid, and Hayek is trilling, whooping and smirking away in a world of her own. • Released on 5 February on Amazon Prime Video.",Bliss,FILM
Sia apologises over autism depiction in her movie Music,"Sia, the musician whose debut film earned two Golden Globe nominations on Wednesday, has addressed concerns about the movie’s depiction of autism. Writing on her Twitter account, which she shortly afterwards deleted, the artist said that she has “been listening” to the criticism surrounding the film’s portrayal of a nonverbal autistic person, played by Maddie Ziegler, who does not have autism. She said the film will now be preceded with a warning that reads: “Music in no way condones or recommends the use of restraint on autistic people. There are autistic occupational therapists that specialize in sensory processing who can be consulted to explain safe ways to provide proprioceptive, deep-pressure feedback to help with meltdown safety.” She then tweeted: “I’m sorry,” and said she plans to remove the restraint scenes from future prints. “I listened to the wrong people,” she said, “and that is my responsibility, my research was clearly not thorough enough, not wide enough.” This week, Music was the surprise recipient of two Golden Globe nominations: one in the best musical or comedy category and one for lead actress Kate Hudson. Last November, Sia first engaged online with autism rights activists who felt she was approaching the condition from the perspective of a neurotypical person, as was her leading performer. At that time, Sia remained robust in her defence of the film, writing: “The movie is both a love letter to caregivers and to the autism community. I have my own unique view of the community, and felt it is underrepresented and compelled to make it. If that makes me a shit I’m a shit, but my intentions are awesome.” A petition asking for the film to be cancelled subsequently gained more than 17,000 signatures, and the petition page was flooded with responses from people unhappy at both Sia’s approach in the film and her “lack of remorse”.",Sia,FILM-CREW
Lost Girls and Love Hotels review – submission and secrets in erotic Tokyo drama,"Author and artist Catherine Hanrahan has adapted her novel of the same name for the screen and William Olsson directs. It is the story of Margaret, a young American woman in Tokyo, who has snagged a job teaching trainee flight attendants how to enunciate their English properly. Margaret drinks a lot, parties a lot, shows up hungover and late to work; she is also into BDSM, and is a sub, but can’t find any satisfactory partner, until she chances across Kazu (Takehiro Hira), a yakuza mobster whose naked body naturally turns out to be almost completely covered in scary tattoos. He has exactly the right fiercely negligent ruthlessness when he takes her to love hotels, but through an ironic quirk of fate turns out to have a softer side – something that this liaison with Margaret has unlocked, and in bed confesses to her mournfully that he is about to get married, and this lends something weirdly poignant and melancholy to their eroticism. The film isn’t perfect, and there is a touch of orientalism about the obsessive-affair-with-Japanese-man trope (which surfaced also in Wash Westmoreland’s The Earthquake Bird in 2019). But there is also something well controlled in the movie as it maintains its cool, even pace and Alexandra Daddario’s performance as the vulnerable, secretive yet emotionally open Margaret is smart. There is also good support from Carice van Houten as Margaret’s cheerfully cynical expat friend Ines and also from Misuzu Kanno as Nakamura, the older woman who is Margaret’s employer, balancing her competing impulses towards caring and disapproval. • Released on 8 February on digital formats.",Lost Girls and Love Hotels,FILM
A Glitch in the Matrix review – deep-dive into simulation theory,"With Room 237, a deep dive into theories about Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining, writer-director-animator Rodney Ascher practically invented a new sub-genre of documentary: the fathoms-five-low inspection of fandom theories and nuttery. Tonally blending sympathetic dispassion and ever-so-slight amused mockery over a fast-shuffling montage of clips that just fit under the bar of fair use, Ascher’s technique created a fascinating brainstorm essay equally about cinema, spectatorship and the ability of works of art to generate interpretations well beyond the intentions of their makers. His latest, A Glitch in the Matrix, pulls off the trick again, appropriately enough on an even bigger scale. This time the subject is simulation theory: the hypothesis that we are all living inside a synthetic world, like the human beings in The Matrix movies who are kept in pods, jacked into a giant supercomputer that injects a delusion straight into their brainstems. The film interviews individuals with differing opinions on simulation theory: some philosophers, some journalists and some likable kooks who fervently believe they’re living in a simulacrum, a few of whom appear disguised in digital avatar get-ups that add a bizarre comic layer. Elsewhere there’s a long archive clip of the great sci-fi seer of simulation theory, Philip K Dick, giving a lecture in the 1970s on his theories about slippery realities that he channelled into his books The Man in the High Castle and Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said. Ascher deploys abundant clips from the Matrix films and the many film adaptations of Dick’s fiction, but there’s plenty of his own original animation to illustrate some of the stories, including an account from one young man who killed his parents because he thought he was in the Matrix and nothing mattered. Parents of adolescent and younger kids will be interested to see Minecraft world-building is also in the mix, along with Plato’s allegory of the cave, the Mandela effect and Elon Musk talking about artificial intelligence. What’s missing from this fecund brew, which you could imagine being twice as long, is any kind of judgment or analysis of the subjects. It’s up to the viewer to notice that some of the interviewees talk of deeply religious upbringings or receiving a diagnosis of schizophrenia, which might explain the roots of their beliefs. Or maybe they’re right and we are all living in a simulation. • A Glitch in the Matrix is available on digital platforms from 5 February.",A Glitch in the Matrix,FILM
Trump resigns from Screen Actors Guild before they can expel him,"Donald Trump has resigned from the Screen Actors Guild (Sag-Aftra), the union for US performers on film and TV, as the union’s leadership began moves to expel him. In a letter dated 4 February 2021 and addressed to Gabrielle Carteris, the union’s national president, Trump said: “I write to you today regarding the so-called Disciplinary Committee hearing aimed at revoking my union membership. Who cares!” Citing his appearances in Home Alone 2, Zoolander, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps and the TV show The Apprentice, Trump added: “I’ve also greatly helped the cable news television business (said to be a dying platform with not much time left until I got involved in politics), and created thousands of jobs at networks such as MSDNC and Fake News CNN, among many others.” After claiming the union “has done little for its members, and nothing for me”, Trump finished his letter saying: “I no longer wish to be associated with your union. As such, this letter is to inform you of my immediate resignation from Sag-Aftra. You have done nothing for me.” The union responded with a two-word statement: “Thank you.” Trump’s move follows an announcement by Sag-Aftra in January that Trump was being referred to a disciplinary committee after the Capitol breach and what the union described as “a reckless campaign of misinformation aimed at discrediting and ultimately threatening the safety of journalists, many of whom are Sag-Aftra members”. Carteris said at the time: “Donald Trump attacked the values that this union holds most sacred – democracy, truth, respect for our fellow Americans of all races and faiths, and the sanctity of the free press. There’s a straight line from his wanton disregard for the truth to the attacks on journalists perpetrated by his followers.” According to financial reports disclosed in 2020, Trump currently earns a pension of over $98,000 for work on union-covered projects, which would not be affected by his leaving.",Donald Trump,PERFORMER
Rams review – Aussie remake of a dour Icelandic delight,"Sheep-farming brothers Colin (Sam Neill) and Les (Michael Caton) are linked by blood. Not just their own but also, like generations before them, the bloodline of the rare breed of sheep they raise on their scratch of land in Western Australia. The feud between these bristling, taciturn men has festered for decades: they haven’t spoken in 40 years. When a deadly disease is diagnosed in Les’s prize ram and the authorities order a livestock cull in the valley, his response involves whisky and a shotgun. But Colin is cannier. Can the brothers finally find common ground? Adapted from Grímur Hákonarson’s acclaimed 2015 film, this version trades frostbitten Nordic reserve for a broader comic approach. It works on the assumption that a story about grumpy old gits united against a common foe has a universal appeal. True, to an extent, but what the makers of this film fail to realise is that it was the specificity of the Icelandic original that made it such a glumly hilarious delight.

A Glitch in the Matrix review – a mind-blowing dive into simulation theory,"As a documentarian, Rodney Ascher is more comfortable than many with subjectivity. Having previously delved into a host of far-fetched theories about Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining with Room 237, Ascher now explores “simulation theory”: the belief that the world in which we exist is artificial – a rendered reality; part of a game or experiment controlled by a higher intelligence. The jumping-off point for this elliptical combination of computer animation, archive footage and virtual interviews is a 1977 lecture by Philip K Dick. But the development of the idea is traced from Plato’s allegory of the cave and numerous religions, through films, literature and computer gaming, to current advocates such as Elon Musk. It’s a messy, mind-blowing collision of philosophy, technology, religion and fruit-loop paranoia which, while it doesn’t exactly make a watertight case, does provide a fascinating, and in one case deeply disturbing, insight into the thought processes of those who believe it. • On multiple digital platforms",A Glitch in the Matrix,FILM
"From the archive: Kingsley Amis and his love of horror films, July 1968","The novelist Kingsley Amis wrote about being a horror film addict for the Observer Magazine of 7 July 1968 (‘Terror in the Cinema’). This is surprising because Amis had an extreme fear of the dark and of being alone. Of course, this being Amis, he objected to the popular term. ‘Terror film would be a better label,’ he argued, because ‘they are not symptoms of the sickness of our society’. Amis was an anti-intellectual when it came to genre films – ‘eggheads out!’ – preferring to simply enjoy the ‘cavortings both abominable and harmless’. Indeed, when he wondered what the appeal of the horror film was, he wrote: ‘Like Mark Twain on a dissimilar occasion, I have an answer to that: I don’t know.’ He argued that ‘The adult Western, like Bad Day at Black Rock, demonstrating its seriousness by short-changing us on action, has not made its mark.’ That may have been true, but it certainly wasn’t true of the John Sturges noir classic. ‘The psychological thriller, under Hitchcock, has done better,’ Amis said, ‘though it only really clicked when it abandoned the supposedly deep probing of Spellbound for the fairly straight and very enthusiastic Grand Guignol of Psycho.’ He admired the US contribution to ‘the great horror revival’, especially that of Vincent Price ‘whether receiving or dealing out assorted gory treatments’. Difficult also to disagree with his assessment of ‘one of the best horror episodes of all’ – the ventriloquist’s-dummy sequence in 1945’s Dead of Night. Amis had an amusingly hard time suspending his disbelief in The Fly: ‘Here, the hastiest of mumbo-jumbo was run through with the palpable design of proceeding to the disagreeable activities and physical appearance of a fly with a chap’s head and a chap with a fly’s head… Even science-fiction ought to have balked at the idea of giving both these characters some kind of human intelligence.’",Kingsley Amis,OTHERS
If It Were Love review – a dance doc powered by the exuberance of youth,"There is a delicate mixture of sensuality and creativity in this documentary. Patric Chiha follows the rehearsal and performance of a dance piece called Crowd by the Franco-Austrian artist and choreographer Gisèle Vienne, about the 90s club scene. The film follows the dance itself and stages one-on-one conversation scenes in which the young dancers talk about each other and the characters they play – a higher gossip, perhaps, about their lives and how this fictional creation shapes their sense of themselves and their sexuality. Compared with, say, Gaspar Noé’s orgiastic dance movie Climax, If It Were Love is certainly more calm and less mad, more ruminative and less confrontational. Perhaps what it is about fundamentally is youth, something each dancer radiates unknowingly: a pure energy and abandon and openness. It would be better to witness this dance piece live (a Covid-era yearning) but there is something interesting in seeing this eternal theme of youth explored and embodied. A dancer might talk about how a kiss did not happen with another character on stage – or, alternatively, that it did happen – and the exchange feels personally charged and intimate, like a conversation taking place after a party, with people confiding who they think they are in love with. And of course to some extent these conversations themselves are fictional performances, which the film builds into the official choreography. If It Were Love is probably more of a festival event film than anything, but it is valuable and pregnant with ideas. • Released on 11 February on Mubi.",If It Were Love,FILM

The Twentieth Century review – Canadian satire dials up the quirk,"Matthew Rankin is an experimental Canadian film-maker now presenting his debut feature, and the director he most obviously resembles is the silent-movie pasticheur Guy Maddin – a comparison some will find intriguing and others heart-sinking. For me, it’s somehow both. But there are interesting signs that Rankin has something Maddin does not: a sense of humour. We get one or two actual laughs. The Twentieth Century is a weird melange of expressionist theatrics, monochrome and bleached-out colourisations (although it is not faux-silent in the Maddin style, and no scratches on the print), sometimes resembling a stage-play. It is a quirky dream-comedy about Mackenzie King, Canada’s venerable Liberal prime minister and establishment panjandrum, which satirises the country’s stolid colonial traditions. King – or a fictionalised version of him – is played by Dan Beirne as an earnest, priggish young careerist with a Stan Laurel-ish bowler hat. He yearns to be prime minister, subservient to the British colonial establishment, symbolised by a national flag called the “Disappointment”. King is also in love with his political rival’s daughter Ruby (Catherine St-Laurent) but finds himself drawn to his elderly mother’s Francophone Quebecers separatist nurse (Sarianne Cormier) and there are bizarre sexual shenanigans, as King derives secret pleasure from sniffing Catherine’s discarded boot. It is funny when King and his competitors have to go through a series of wacky tests (in lieu of anything like a democratic election) to see if they have the right stuff to be a properly pompous and pointless Canadian prime minister.

I had been his assistant at Granada TV 30 years earlier. Three months later more than 100 people, few of whom knew each other personally, gathered in central London. Michael spoke quietly, pointing out that we were represented by multiple organisations and that this was a catastrophic weakness. A group of us volunteered to meet again and two years later a powerful single voice, Directors UK, emerged. It would not have done so without Michael’s gentle but firm insistence.",Michael Apted,FILM-CREW
Breeder review – muddled torture porn horror,"A movie from Denmark that sounds enjoyably bizarre but actually amounts to a yucky helping of torture/imprisonment porn and gonzo violence. Sara Hjort Ditlevsen is Mia, a stylish woman with a liking for horses and BDSM. Her rich but dull husband, Thomas (Anders Heinrichsen), is squeamish about gratifying Mia’s tastes, but hardly squeaky clean. He is a secret investor in a creepy eternal-youth genetic treatment programme, being developed by the couple’s sinister neighbour Dr Isabel Ruben (Signe Egholm Olsen), who looks 40 but is actually 60 and has some sort of hold on Thomas; she is now kidnapping young women off the streets for her research like a latter-day Elizabeth “Blood Countess” Báthory. Mia tries investigating Dr Ruben’s loathsome facility and finds herself walled up there as well. The hero/villain dynamic in this film gets muddled, which is important for this kind of horror-melodrama: Mia is at first presented as not very nice – arrogant, maybe, infatuated with wealth and status, and nursing unresolved feelings about her dark taste in transgressive sex. But other people then easily trump her nastiness and Mia has to be a sexualised victim-heroine in the evil torture-dungeon scenario (although her BDSM is now presented as ironic). Thomas’s split loyalties, meanwhile, make him seem feeble rather than complex. As for Dr Ruben, she has a Rosa Klebb-like energy that would be interesting in a less humourless film. • Available from 15 February on digital formats.",Breeder,FILM
Dead Pigs review – winding tale of life in cash-crazed Shanghai,"A breezily westernised style of Chinese movie is on offer in this 2018 debut feature from Chinese-American film-maker Cathy Yan, who two years later went to Hollywood to direct Birds of Prey, starring Margot Robbie. Dead Pigs is an ensemble dramedy set in Shanghai that satirises – in a distinctly lenient way – the commercialism eating away at China’s heart. It is inspired by a real-life incident in which thousands of dead pigs were found in the city’s Huangpu river, dumped by poverty-stricken farmers who couldn’t pay the disposal fees; the pig symbolism reminded me a tiny bit of Alan Bennett’s A Private Function. Candy Wang (Vivian Wu) is a beauty salon owner who lives in her parents’ rickety old house, the only one standing in a rubble-strewn waste ground, because she is holding out against offers from a property company called Golden Happiness; it wants to build a bizarre Vegas-style development there based on Barcelona, complete with a tacky replica of the Sagrada Família. Her brother Old Wang (Haoyu Yang) is in dire financial trouble after borrowing money from gangsters to fund his absurd “investment portfolio” in pigs, which have all died. Old Wang’s son Zhen (Mason Lee) is a hard-up waiter who pretends to his dad he’s doing well; he befriends wealthy Instagram-style princess Xia Xia (Meng Li) and soon finds out how lonely and unhappy she really is. Meanwhile, Golden Happiness have hired a smooth American architect called Sean (David Rysdahl), whose US qualifications are phoney: he has been recruited by another American, Angie (Zazie Beetz), for sideline work as a model for promo events, pretending to be an American celeb or reality TV star. The movie zings and pinballs around, ricocheting within its ironic pattern of coincidences, and those dead pigs keep bobbing metaphorically up, reported by TV news broadcasts – always a cheesy and unconvincing storytelling technique. Dead Pigs is an unassuming topical entertainment (rather different from the movies of its executive producer Jia Zhangke), but diverting and well-acted. • Released on 12 February on Mubi.",Dead Pigs,FILM
"Moufida Tlatli, Silences of the Palace director, dies aged 73","Moufida Tlatli, the pioneering Tunisian film-maker behind much-admired festival hits The Silences of the Palace and The Season of Men, has died aged 73. News media said that she died on Sunday, with the news confirmed by the Tunisian ministry of culture. Tlatli remains best known for her breakthrough 1994 feature The Silences of the Palace, a lyrical study of a woman’s return to an abandoned royal residence, which tackled the themes of exploitation and trauma as experienced across generations of Arab women. It won a string of international awards, including the Sutherland trophy at the London film festival for the most “original and imaginative” film of the year, and was named as one of Africa’s 10 best films by critic and director Mark Cousins. The film was inspired by her mother’s difficult life; in 2001, Tlatli told the Guardian she “was riven with guilt … It was so insupportable, exhausting, suffocating.” Tlatli told the Guardian: “Traditionally in the Arab film world, a girl works in continuity or is an editor. I had never thought of making films.” In her next film, released in 2000, Tlatli dealt with not dissimilar material about relations between the sexes. The Season of Men is about a community on the Tunisian island of Djerba whose males spend most of the year away working, and return only for a month. The Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw called it “a beautifully lucid, compassionate film [and] a powerful and deeply engaging family drama”. Like Silences of the Palace, The Season of Men found much favour on the international film circuit, winning a number of awards. Tlatli was born in 1947 in Sidi Bou Said and studied film editing in Paris, before returning to Tunisia in 1972 to work as an editor. She completed a third feature, Nadia et Sarra, in 2004, starring Palestinian actor-director Hiam Abbass. In 2011, Tlatli was appointed minister for culture in the transitional government after the Tunisian revolution. •This article was amended on 9 February to correct the assertion that Tlatli was the first female Arab film-maker to direct a feature film.",Moufida Tlatli,FILM-CREW
Willy’s Wonderland review – Nicolas Cage cleans up in gory horror story,"There will be sniggering once word gets out about this ridiculous horror film featuring a former kids’ birthday venue/game arcade occupied by evil, life-size animatronic puppets. However, to its credit, the film doesn’t take itself in the slightest bit seriously, because with a premise like that, really how could it? Especially when it has Nicolas Cage, uncharacteristically silent in a dialogue-free role, starring as a bad-ass drifter tricked into spending a night cleaning the haunted premises but proving to be a worthy opponent of the malevolent mechanical creatures. A posse of pesky, academically challenged kids are on hand to be picked off one by one by the bestiary of broken toys, whose leader takes the shape of a sinister weasel named Willy. The great character actor Beth Grant (Mrs Sometimes I Doubt Your Commitment to Sparkle Motion in Donnie Darko) plays the local sheriff who gets to give the big explication monologue about the building’s history, real estate deals and satanic possession. Casting a deep intertextual shadow over proceedings is the spirit of Chuck E Cheese, the string of franchised restaurants featuring oversized mechanical puppets founded in the US in the early 80s that scarred the psyches of people such as Willy’s Wonderland director Kevin Lewis. The parody versions of the songs here are pretty funny, as is Cage’s solemn devotion to his job, down to his insistence that he takes a pinball game break at intervals throughout the film. There’s also something weirdly satisfying about watching him clean the grime off the restaurant, like one of those reality-TV shows in which middle-aged ladies with rubber gloves scrub the homes of hoarders, but with added demons. • Willy’s Wonderland is available on digital platforms from 12 February.",Willy’s Wonderland,FILM
Anti-Life review – ropey Alien-lite romp with Bruce Willis,"It’s the year 2242 and Bruce Willis is still an ageing tough guy who’s kicking butt. That’s the alarming prospect raised by this ropey low-budget sci-fi set aboard a spacecraft carrying 300,000 people from dying Earth to life on a new planet. The plot centres on a parasitic alien chomping its way through the crew hired to keep the vessel ticking over while the passengers cryogenically sleep out the six-month journey. And the film-makers, having borrowed the storyline from Alien, also go for the same blue-collar, boilersuit-wearing, truckers-in-space realism. Willis growls a few lines, half-arses a catchphrase or two and points a gun. The film’s actual lead character is played by Cody Kearsley: Noah, a janitor on this spacecraft, which is the last to leave Earth for the new colony. His heavily pregnant girlfriend is a passenger. (Weirdly, no one seems worried about cryogenically deep-freezing her unborn baby.) Willis plays his hard-drinking boss Clay, though it’s a stretch to call what he does here acting. Security on board is tight following bomb threats from rebels who believe that, having screwed up one planet, humanity don’t deserve another spin of the wheel. It’s a briefly interesting idea, this group of militants trying to stop the spread of parasite humans into outer space, but instead Anti-Life feeds off sci-fi movies past. Enter an alien organism that first appears on screen as a glistening blur accompanied by scuttering on the soundtrack. I’m not sure if it’s still possible after so many Alien copycats to make the spectacle of an alien lifeform exploding out of a human host genuinely scary – and definitely not with the silly effects here. It’s called Anti-Life but it’s definitely not pro film. • Available from 12 February on digital platforms.",Anti-Life,FILM
Dragon Rider review – starry family animation seeks fire,"Not to be mistaken for the Dreamworks film How to Train Your Dragon franchise, here is a reasonably entertaining German family animation based on the 1997 bestseller by children’s author Cornelia Funke. It’s a great-looking film, energetically voiced in English by an A-team of British actors, but seriously let down by unexciting storytelling. Little children, though, may connect to the environmental message. Once upon a time, dragons and humans coexisted in harmony until humans hunted dragons close to extinction. Now the dragons live hidden deep in the rainforest, but deforestation is bringing their old foe ever closer. Among the dragons is young Firedrake (voiced by Thomas Brodie-Sangster), who has an embarrassing problem: he can’t breathe fire. Whenever he tries, only little fart-puffs of smoke come out. To prove his worth, he sets off to find a mythical utopia in the Himalayas, a place where dragons are said to live in peace and safety. Firedrake’s sidekick is feisty chipmunk Sorrell (Felicity Jones), and the pair set off on a predictable quest to find the mythical rim. Not far behind them is villain Nettlebrand, a manmade metal dragon (wonderfully voiced by Patrick Stewart with a sneer of superiority). En route they pick up homeless human teenager Ben (Freddie Highmore), who pretends to be a dragon rider. And here, jarringly, the film-makers drop in a winking reference to their rival franchise: when Firedrake crash-lands into the human city, there is the premiere of film called How to Tame Your Dragon. This movie doesn’t match the first couple of Train Your Dragon films for imagination. Still, it’s got a gag that would never make it into a Hollywood family movie: the first time the kid Ben meets Firedrake, he peers underneath the dragon and asks bemusedly: “You are a male dragon, aren’t you?” • Released on 12 February on Sky Cinema.",Dragon Rider,FILM
School's Out Forever review – gloriously gory adaptation of YA sci-fi horror,"Adapted from a trilogy of young adult books by Scott K Andrews, that forms part of the “shared world” Afterblight Chronicles series, this gory British boys’ school-set sci-fi posits a deadly virus that swiftly kills almost everyone everywhere except those with a particular blood type. If The Lord of the Flies crossed with The Road and a dash of Tom Brown’s School Days sounds like your bag of blood, than this ruthless romp will be a kick in the head. Director Oliver Milburn, who has made a bunch of horror-themed shorts and one feature (The Harsh Light of Day), has a real knack for staging action and coaxing sincere, punchy performances from his mostly young cast. Much of the story is seen through the eyes of Lee (Oscar Kennedy, actually 22 but babyfaced enough to pass for a teenager), one of the few scholarship boys at St Mark’s, a posh all-male school deep in the English countryside. Busted by the headmaster (Anthony Head, forever Giles from Buffy the Vampire Slayer) for a silly prank, he gets expelled on the same day the UK government starts talking about closing the border to prevent the spread of a deadly virus. Naturally, this fictional UK being true to form, it is already too late; when Lee is left alone he has nowhere else to go but back to St Mark’s. There he finds a few survivors, including his best buddy Mac (Liam Lau Fernandez), a matron not much older than the boys (Jasmine Blackborow) and a few teachers. The survivors start scavenging for food but before long they run afoul of the townies from the well-heeled suburb nearby. Milburn’s screenplay has a streak of dry wit but it never goes for cheap laughs. Instead, it’s a surprisingly bleak and merciless work, judiciously killing off both sympathetic and unlikable characters, including some of the kids and even an unfortunate pet, a line most films are too timid to cross but one that is entirely plausible given the circumstances. Expect more instalments in the franchise if this one takes off. • Available from 15 February on digital platforms.",School's Out Forever,FILM
Broil review – Jonathan Lipnicki serves up murder in fantasy thriller,"Any Gen Xers happy to see one more pop culture touchstone bulldozed will appreciate this ambitious but overstuffed fantasy thriller in which Jerry Maguire’s gorgeous poppet Jonathan Lipnicki appears as a murderous autistic chef with an encyclopaedic knowledge of toxins. He plays Sydney, a short-order cook hired by two scions of the fearsome Sinclair clan to dispatch the patriarch August (Timothy V Murphy) at a family dinner. This monster, with a caustic Ulster accent and a grin like a dagger flash, has cut a deal with his children to take custody of his granddaughter Chance (Avery Konrad) so he can inculcate her into the full extent of her powers. The Sinclairs must be invited over the threshold, need daily transfusions of human blood, and sprout tumours after being exposed to too much daylight – so are they vampires? An “oversimplification,” according to Sydney. Beginning with Chance at home and being expelled from school, director Edward Drake tries to ground Broil’s mythology in a more original, domestic setting. But his preamble is off-puttingly cumbersome, full of insinuated but vague backstory that becomes even harder to navigate when the film drops into nested flashbacks and flashforwards to usher in the murder plot. Drake works hard stylistically, but his reagents – Twilight-style young adult and high-gothic horror – threaten never to mix. Eventually, the dinner gives the narrative some focus. From the head of the table, August ferrets out his poisoners and – turning the dial up on a performance that already began close to 10 – organises a set of sadistic after-dinner games in revenge. The power games and grandstanding far more cleanly impart the family’s place within the dark metaphysical backdrop Drake had been awkwardly pinning up behind them. His flair for maintaining a rancorous grand-guignol atmosphere – without resorting to too much gore – hints at a promising future in genre cinema, provided he can keep things simple. • Released on 15 February on digital formats.",Broil,FILM
Sator review – deeply creepy cabin-in-the-woods horror,"This extremely low-budget horror film is a lot like a bunch of movies you know – particularly The Blair Witch Project and The Witch, as well as the experimental cinema of Kenneth Anger – but also not quite like anything else. It’s a kind of uniqueness to be treasured, although genre fans may feel frustrated with how slowly the plot reveals itself, its degraded visual style, and its wilful obliqueness. Shot mostly in a snowy forest and a log cabin that writer-director Jordan Graham built himself (he did every job on the film, apart from acting), the film mixes staged scenes with found material. It’s performed mostly by actors but also by Graham’s grandmother June Peterson, who appears to have dementia in real life and whose belief in a supernatural being called Sator who watches over her forms the seed around which Graham has grown the story. Gabriel Nicholson plays June’s withdrawn fictional grandson Adam, who is seemingly disturbed by events long ago; he now lives in the cabin. His obsession with “deer” in the woods is revealed to be a haunting by creepy-looking horned creature-y things that have a way of turning up in a jump cut. Adam’s siblings check up on him, but it becomes clear that this is one screwed-up family. Mixing black and white, low-resolution footage with more colourful material creates a bricolage-like effect that keeps wrong-footing the viewer. Graham uses darkness and a very sparse score/soundscape to create a truly disturbing work that relies not so much on gore as the uncanny in its most potent form: stillness, pools of darkness and just-visible figures. I’ve watched dozens of films at home since lockdown, and this is one of the few I wish I could have seen in a blacked-out cinema. • Sator is available on digital platforms from 15 February.",Sator,FILM
Pvt Chat review – refreshingly grownup take on virtual sex,"In a 2016 Vanity Fair article, Nancy Jo Sales wrote about prostitution going mainstream, describing a new economy of young people selling their bodies to pay off student loans or just to get by in the tough economic climate. On the same theme, Ben Hozie makes his feature debut with this semi-insightful, uncomfortably funny indie drama about a man who becomes obsessed with an online sex worker. It’s a film with a slackerish mumblecore vibe, and Hozie is refreshingly grown up about sex. But it’s hard to see how his film adds much to the conversation about intimacy in the internet age. It’s set in the self-consciously hip New York art scene where Jack (Peter Vack) calls himself a professional gambler; though watching him max out his credit cards playing internet blackjack it’s obvious that he’s hooked. His other addiction is cam-girls – women who perform sex acts in front of a webcam for money. Jack spends a fortune tipping his favourite, dominatrix Scarlet (Julia Fox); she calls him her slave and in a funny-excruciating scene virtually stubs her cigarette out on his tongue. What’s clever about the script is that Jack isn’t some “incel” creep who can’t function in the real world. He’s a bit lost, but he’s funny and good-looking (though pallid from all that screen time). An artist ex-girlfriend wants to sleep with him – sex in the real world. But Jack prefers it virtually. About halfway in the perspective flips to Scarlet, played with super-sexy charisma by Fox (who was Adam Sandler’s girlfriend in Uncut Gems and worked as a dominatrix in real life). There is no question of slut-shaming Scarlet – being a sex worker is her choice. But she’s a disappointing character: empty-headed and, away from the webcam, a doormat to her slimy playwright boyfriend. This film is not nearly so edgy as it thinks it is. • Pvt Chat is available on digital platforms from 12 February.",Pvt Chat,FILM
Shia LaBeouf's legal team denies abuse claims by ex-girlfriend FKA twigs,"American actor Shia LaBeouf’s legal team has denied allegations of sexual battery and assault made by his former girlfriend, British musician FKA twigs, in a civil lawsuit last year. LaBeouf’s attorney said in a court filing that the actor “denies generally and specifically each and every allegation” in the complaint. The court document, filed on 5 February and made available to Reuters on Thursday, also states that the singer’s allegation of sexual battery was invalid “because none of the acts alleged were based on sex.” The civil lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles superior court in December under her real name Tahliah Barnett, sought unspecified damages for alleged sexual battery, assault and emotional distress. Barnett also accused LaBeouf of emotional abuse during their year-long relationship in 2019. The lawsuit states that in February 2019 Barnett was a passenger in a vehicle that LaBeouf was driving recklessly, and that he removed his seatbelt and threatened to crash unless she said she loved him. The pair had taken a trip to the desert outside Los Angeles, during which, Barnett alleged, LaBeouf once woke her up in the middle of the night by choking her. LaBeouf, 34, a former child star, is currently undergoing unspecified in-patient treatment, according to a source close to the actor. He had previously issued a general statement apologizing for hurting those around him and citing a history of alcoholism and aggression. In an interview with the New York Times, Barnett, 32, characterised her experience with LaBeouf as “the worst thing I’ve ever been through in the whole of my life” and said she wanted to raise awareness of “the tactics that abusers use to control you and take away your agency”. Responding to detailed allegations about his conduct, LaBeouf told the Times that “many of these allegations are not true” but that he owed Barnett and Karolyn Pho, another woman whose claims feature in the lawsuit, “the opportunity to air their statements publicly and [for me to] accept accountability for those things I have done”. Barnett’s attorney said in a statement on Thursday that LaBeouf’s “legal tact and recovery plan, while not surprising, are poorly misguided self-help strategies.”",Shia LaBeouf,PERFORMER
Slalom review – a teenage skier's hopes go downhill in bone-chilling abuse drama,"Fifteen-year-old Lyz (Noée Abita) is on course to become a champion skier. A gifted athlete, she also has the grit, fearlessness and youthful arrogance necessary to rise through the ranks at a training programme in the Alps. In this tense, bone-chilling first feature, French writer-director Charlène Favier looks at how teenage girls are often punished for that boldness. Abita plays Lyz with an air of invincibility that soon curdles into powerlessness as her coach, Fred (Jérémie Renier), begins to scrutinise and prey on her vulnerabilities. He comments on her changing body, pinching her stomach and lecturing her about how “periods are beautiful”. But for every inappropriate remark, there’s welcome praise too. With her mother (Muriel Combeau) off in Marseilles and distracted by a new boyfriend, and her friends more interested in partying, perfectionist Lyz can’t help but crave adult acknowledgment. It’s a vicious cycle: Lyz trains harder, and so Fred intervenes further, treating each win as an invitation to cross another boundary. Favier is smart on the mechanics of abuse, and the sobering inevitability of her heroine’s downhill skid. • On Curzon Home Cinema",Slalom,FILM
Letter: Rémy Julienne obituary,"I worked on many commercials with Rémy Julienne (obituary, 4 February). He “acted” in so many films that he deserved a special Oscar.

His brilliant team organised for me a seven-car crash on a rain-soaked road (for a commercial for Uniroyal rain tyres directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud). Shot with six cameras, it was perfect – Cut! – then, one hour later, Rémy told me that all the cars were repaired and they were ready for a second take.

Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar review – Wiig and Mumolo laughing all the way to the beach,"This fun and diverting comedy from work wives Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo, who co-wrote 2011’s Bridesmaids, has a silly premise. After being made redundant, culotte-wearing besties Barb (Mumolo) and Star (Wiig) use their severance pay to escape their midwestern hometown for a holiday at the Palm Vista Hotel in Florida. It’s a “middle-aged paradise”, and so Edgar (Jamie Dornan), the young Irish heartthrob they meet at the bar, sticks out like a sore thumb. He’s there on business, involved in a sinister plot involving genetically modified mosquitos. The sci-fi stuff is tedious, but Wiig and Mumolo are bawdy and brilliant as ever, their effortless chemistry bolstered by years of collaboration. As for Dornan, a notably sombre and wooden screen presence in the Fifty Shades of Grey movies, he is required to prance about a sandy beach, participate in several musical numbers and even shake a pair of maracas. He’s an interesting, amusing casting choice, genuinely endearing here as a supervillain’s accomplice and wannabe boyfriend. Comedy, it seems, is a less awkward fit.

Music review – Sia's tone-deaf treatment of autism,"For many years, Australian pop star Sia has hidden behind a fringe that covers her eyes. Using actors instead of starring in her own music videos, she has preferred not to centre herself. Yet her directorial debut appears to draw from her own experiences with addiction; its protagonist Zu (a near-bald Kate Hudson) is a recovering alcoholic. This is confusing, given that the film’s title refers to her non-speaking, neurodivergent younger sister Music (Maddie Ziegler), whose main purpose is to absolve Zu from her troubled past. Ziegler, who appeared on the reality TV show Dance Moms, and features in some of Sia’s best-known videos (including Chandelier and Elastic Heart), is not herself on the autistic spectrum. It’s a problem, especially given the cartoonishness of her portrayal, which sees her gurning, grimacing and mumbling through her scenes. Music uses an augmentative and alternative communication device to translate rudimentary expressions such as “I am happy” and “I am sad”. Her interior world is just as simplistic, conveyed via goofy musical interludes rendered in childlike primary colours and abstract shapes. The lyrics, jaunty platitudes about Music’s “magic mind” and failing body, are offensive too. These self-consciously upbeat moments clash horribly with the wider redemption narrative.

The Kiosk review – fond farewell to a Parisian newsstand,"In its unassuming way, this sparky documentary captures an aspect of modern Paris life at the very moment that it’s becoming obsolete: almost a fragment of the belle époque. Alexandra Pianelli is an artist and film-maker who is working shifts at a newspaper kiosk in Paris, which is run by her mum and which was once run by her grandparents and great-grandparents before that. With a headcam, she films the regular customers who come in to buy their papers and magazines and generally chat and flirt with Pianelli – her camera records their faces, and she also sketches them and creates witty little models and stop-motion animation sequences to show what life is like in her kiosk. Things are tough. A distribution strike reduces the number of papers they have to sell but their overheads remain the same. An old-fashioned clippings research agency goes bust owing them €30,000, which they will never see. A demo on the street results in better sales one day, but their eyes are stinging from the teargas. Unlike British cornershops selling papers, the kiosk can’t diversify into fruit, veg and convenience-store sandwiches. And, of course, most importantly, the internet is killing print – the kiosk’s bread and butter. Pianelli’s mum is seriously considering retirement and letting the kiosk be dismantled (and we are entitled to suspect that the film-maker knew perfectly well from the outset that this retirement is a certainty, and would provide her with a bittersweet ending). We in fact only glimpse Pianelli herself a couple of times – but her headcam is clearly an icebreaker for the regulars who cheerfully play up, now that they know what she is doing. This is a very sweet, charming film and there is something high-minded and even innocent about this little island of print journalism. • The Kiosk is released on 19 February on True Story.",The Kiosk,FILM
Digger review – family tensions are unearthed in slow-burn Greek drama,"Its plot featuring a giant mining corporation known as “the monster” tearing up the landscape and causing bitter division among the hard-drinking local populace, this handsomely shot drama could be taking place in rust-belt America. But this is backwoods Greece, where forest rancher Nikitas (Vangelis Mourikis), first seen fending off a landslide caused by the miners’ activities, is fighting a running battle to keep them from despoiling the haven he loves. A motorbike throttle at midnight announces the arrival of his estranged son Johnny (Argyris Pandazaras), whose need to claim his inheritance adds to the pressure on Nikitas to ship out. With this father-son conflict, and a liking for contemporary imagery like Johnny’s motocross track to liven up the classicism, director Georgis Grigorakis in his feature debut makes a claim on the same kind of romantic-realist territory as Jacques Audiard. Father and son are forced to cohabit in Nikitas’s forest cabin; their feuding starts small – he tries to make Johnny wear slippers inside – but gradually becomes inflamed by past grievances. Mourikis, looking like a skulking Leonard Cohen, coolly underplays the resentment and regrets until they explode at the corporate lackeys, like when they cut down his walnut tree. It’s a shame that, as it ramps up, this generational tension isn’t dramatised with the sharpness it might have been. Johnny is more thinly drawn, leaving Digger over-reliant on Nikitas’s selfish idealism – and some occasionally on-the-nose scenes revolving around it. Luckily, Grigorakis’ breakdown of the town’s factions is more subtle. And he and cinematographer Giorgos Karvelas not only have an eye for striking visuals, but they know how to use them in amplifying counterpoint: the forest dells are filmed with the protective intimacy Nikitas feels for them, as against the shock and awe of the mining excavator’s behemoth teeth. A bracing backdrop for a world-weary but engaging film. Released on 16 February on Mubi.",Digger,FILM
What Lies Below review – a dire coming-of-age horror with a fishy twist,"You might find enough giggles in this stupendously silly coming-of-age horror to keep yourself amused. But, honestly, it’s not really funny enough to be enjoyably bad – even with a bizarro erotic storyline involving humans and fish. It stars Ema Horvath (who, it’s fair to say, looks pretty uncomfortable) as 16-year-old Liberty, back from summer camp to find that her mum, Michelle (Mena Suvari), has installed a young new boyfriend in their home. He is superhunk John, an aquatic geneticist played by Trey Tucker, whose wooden acting I doubt would make the grade in a porn film. Embarrassingly, Liberty can’t hide the fact that she has a massive crush on John. Worse, he creepily stares at her while making out with her mum in the kitchen – and walks around the house naked. Director Braden R Duemmler creates zero tension in these moments. Is there an erotic frisson between Liberty and John? Or does his behaviour amount to grooming? Through all of this, mum Michelle is clueless and poor Suvari has nothing to do but drool over John, and pant terrible cougar-ish lines like: “I’m riding him constantly.” As it happens, the question about which lucky lady has the keys to John’s heart melts away when he is seen – a la Troy McClure – pervily eyeing up specimens in the tank in the basement; fish are his one true love. “You’re kind of a weird dude,” says Liberty, underplaying the freaky plot twist. To prepare you for that, there’s a mad scene in which Liberty gets her period in a rowing boat with John – who leans over and licks the blood, a peculiar quiver passing over his face. The denouement when it comes is meant to be shriek of pure sci-fi horror; but really, you’d find better entertainment – and more energetic acting – watching a fish tank. • Released on 22 February on digital platforms.",What Lies Below,FILM
White Colour Black review – Dudley O’Shaughnessy is one to watch,"British-Nigerian director Joseph Adesunloye’s feature debut – made in 2016 but only now seeing the light of day – is the story of a London photographer travelling to Senegal for his father’s funeral. It’s a drifting movie, not entirely successful but grounded by the undeniable screen presence of boxer turned model turned actor Dudley O’Shaughnessy. (He was in the recent season of Top Boy; in his modelling days he appeared opposite Rihanna in the video for We Found Love.) Here he plays Leke, a fashion photographer living the dream in Hackney; home is a loft-style flat overlooking the city and Leke is about to open a major show in China. The film begins with a couple of fake-feeling gallery scenes, everyone head-to-toe in black and air-kissing with extravagant mwah-mwahs (this is the art world recognisable from other movies rather than real life). Despite his success, Leke seems detached from his life in London. He is also ignoring telephone messages from Senegal, where his father is seriously ill. When the inevitable call comes – his dad has died – Leke flies to Dakar. A family friend has arranged for a taxi driver to be his guide. “What do you speak? French? Wolof?” Leke shakes his head no. “Mon ami,” says the guy. “Tu est perdu. You are really, really lost.” Leke zones out, staring out of the taxi window. But Dakar switches him on; he photographs everything around him and starts seeing beautiful Badewa (Yrsa Daley-Ward). Then, reluctantly, he makes the journey to his dad’s village. Someone alludes to a family rift that is never explained – and the script continues in the same vein, revealing nothing about Leke, his childhood or sense of identity. That reticence is frustrating. But O’Shaughnessy – three parts swagger, two parts tenderness – pulls it along nicely. He’s a talent to watch. • Released on 19 February on Curzon Home Cinema.",White Colour Black,FILM
Ashes in the Snow review – heartfelt but brutal YA gulag drama,"Here’s a soapy, semi-harrowing wartime drama based on Ruta Sepetys’s bestselling YA novel Between Shades of Gray, about a teenage girl deported to a Soviet gulag. The book was written for teenagers but discovered by adults; the issue for the movie seems to be uncertainty about which audience is the target. It’s a sometimes hard-hitting, always heartfelt film – and star Bel Powley is an actor with an umami-style knack for adding depth to any film she’s in. But cynical viewers over 17 may find themselves rolling their eyes at snogs grabbed outside prison huts. We start in Lithuania in 1941. Powley is 16-year-old Lina, a promising artist whose father, a university professor, is suspected of working against the Soviets. One night the entire family is arrested; Lina, her mum and little brother are loaded onto a cattle car and transported to a prison camp in Siberia. The commander, icily cruel Komarov (Peter Franzén), sentences them to hard labour in unbearable conditions – digging beetroot out of frozen mud day after day with their bare hands. The characters speak mostly English, though Russian lines are in Russian. There’s no other way around the language problem I suppose, but it is distracting; you can never quite forget you’re watching actors in pretend-dirty clothes talking English with eastern European accents. The film’s pace flags a fair amount, but director Marius A Markevicius sensitively shows Lina’s humiliation and horror as a teenager in the camp. Arriving after weeks on a cramped train with no toilets or water, the prisoners are ordered to strip naked for washing. Lina is mortified by the prospect of getting undressed in public, especially since the boy she likes (Jonah Hauer-King), is standing nearby – in true YA style, atrocity and tragedy can only ever be a backdrop to an epic love story. Though to be fair, Markevicius doesn’t flinch from brutality: upsetting scenes showing prisoners being arbitrarily shot dead and an attempted rape scene more than earn the 15 certificate. A war drama with stabilisers. • Released on 19 February on Amazon Prime Video.",Ashes in the Snow,FILM
Shook review – stalk-and-slash horror with social media angle,"Shook opens with a smart satirical visual gag. It reveals the cast of characters, a bunch of female online influencers who pimp out various products, arriving at a swanky event, complete with popping flashbulbs. An edit from another angle shows not all is as it seems, which pretty much sets the tone for the rest of the film: a thriller in the stalk-and-slash tradition but one that keeps pulling the rug out from under the viewer’s expectations. After the first gory bit of wrong-footing (literally, it involves a shoe as weapon), blonde beauty specialist Mia (Daisye Tutor) emerges as the main protagonist. After she arrives at her family home in the suburbs to watch cute lapdog Chico for her sister Nicole (Emily Goss) for a few days, it gradually becomes clear that Mia and Nicole’s mother died not so long ago, and that the two sisters have a rancorous relationship, mostly because passive-aggressive Nicole resents flighty, irresponsible Mia for not helping out more when their mother was dying. Seemingly surgically attached to her smartphone, Mia streams updates to her fans, and checks in with other friends across town who keep asking her to come over and party with them. But then the neighbour from across the street (Grant Rosenmeyer) reaches out via text and call, and it becomes clear that he might be a suspect in a string of dog and people murders in the area. Once the danger is established, writer-director Jennifer Harrington gets to work deploying jump scares and reveals that are strictly off-the-shelf generic scary stuff. What makes this a little more interesting is the whole social media/home-surveillance angle, which creates certain interesting challenges to demonstrate what’s going on in different places. Harrington uses simple projections on the scenery to show what’s happening in Mia’s phone; later, there are Zoom-style split-screens with multiple characters watching numbly as horror unfolds. It’s all very 2021, and you can’t help wondering how it will age, but as a launching pad for the director and her cast, it’s a very serviceable platform. Tutor is particularly good at looking terrified, and manages to make the vapid, narcissistic Mia just sympathetic enough that you don’t necessarily want to see her, or cute widdle Chico, get killed. • Released on 18 February on Shudder.",Shook,FILM
The Owners review – OAP burglars get more than they bargained for,"This nifty thriller, set mostly in a grand manor house deep in the British countryside, has an impressively evil streak and a clever twist or two that perhaps are not hard to see coming if you’re experienced in the genre. Even so, director Julius Berg, who has worked mostly in French TV and makes his feature debut here, has a knack for ratcheting up suspense and finessing the technicalities in order to maximise the creepiness. For example, the sound design (by Ben Baird) is outstanding, an almost palpable entity that shimmers with synthesiser drones and distorted noises generated by the plot. Elsewhere, when the violence and anxiety reaches its zenith, the film switches aspect ratio to a boxy, nearly square format, heightening the claustrophobia; it’s the sort of thing you might not notice at first but affects the viewing experience in subtle ways. The idea is that three local no-hopers with varying degrees of criminal aspiration plan on burgling the home of Dr Richard and Mrs Ellen Huggins (Sylvester McCoy and Rita Tushingham), a cuddly pair of old dears. Chunky dimwit Terry (Andrew Ellis), the son of the Huggins’s cleaner, has heard they’ve got a huge stash of cash and valuables in the house, and has tipped off his harder, meaner friend Nathan (Ian Kenny) – who has brought along even nastier Gaz (Jake Curran, sporting a truly evil mullet and white dreadlock hairdo). But the sudden appearance of Nathan’s girlfriend, Mary (Maisie Williams), annoyed because Nathan has taken her car and she needs to get to work, throws the plan off kilter, as does the unexpected return of the owners of the property. The young cast are pretty good, but seasoned players McCoy and Tushingham are the real scene stealers, especially Tushingham with those still-wondrous marble blue eyes, just as mesmerising as they were back in the day when she was a British It girl, starring in A Taste of Honey and The Knack … and How to Get It. • Available from 22 February on digital platforms.",The Owners,FILM
Butchers review – worn-out horror tropes salvaged by good performances,"Here is another one of those horror flicks where young people on holiday in rural places are terrorised by crazed degenerates. Even if Butchers is more preoccupied with paying homage to its slasher ancestors than carving out its own turf, the opening scene is atmospheric enough. Against the icy canvas of a snow-covered graveyard, two brothers, Owen (Simon Phillips) and Oswald (Michael Swatton), are burying their mother: the occasion is solemn as Owen delivers a half-hearted two-sentence eulogy. But things kick off when they glimpse a car breaking down, and straight away we are into gore as the brothers ambush and brutally terrorise their first victims. Unfortunately, Butchers struggles to keep up this momentum after the film cuts to two 20-something couples speeding through this cursed terrain. (The brothers are not professional butchers but rather hobbyists with a makeshift slaughterhouse.) These young city folks are eminently dislikable – two of them are hooking up and cheating on their respective partners – yet none of these details helps flesh them out, nor encourage much sympathy at their gory demise. Backwoods killers are a common enough device, but Butchers takes the odd decision to have its Canadian killers speak with a southern drawl à la Texas Chainsaw Massacre, an intentional incongruity that doesn’t really work. Heavy-handed sound effects don’t help, either. Nevertheless, despite the meandering script, it’s Phillips’ performance that keeps the film’s pulse going. His Owen is exhilaratingly unpredictable, alternating between moments of meticulous villainy and sheer lunacy – one moment he will be refitting a spooky music box while eyeing his oblivious prey, next he will be whacking his victim bloodily, channelling a kind of biblical righteousness that makes him slippery, fascinating and, most importantly, terrifying to watch. Despite Phillips’ cleaver-wielding swagger, however, Butchers is pretty much dead meat, an amalgam of worn-out tropes unsuccessfully zombified to life. • Released on 22 February on digital platforms.",Butchers,FILM
Archenemy review – wacky fight for justice in parallel universes,"Small, imperfectly formed but quite entertaining all the same, this wacky sci-fi-adjacent feature stars Joe Manganiello (from the Magic Mike movies and, let’s not forget, Smurfs: The Lost Village) as an intense, homeless man with a cut torso who calls himself Max Fist. Max has a taste for hooch and crystal meth but also claims to be a super powerful fighter for justice from a parallel universe – a realm that just so happens to be accessible through an abandoned shopping mall in grotty Edge City where the action is set. While all that unfolds in a real enough looking US city, shot on film stock, the stories Max narrates about his previous life in the other universe are illustrated with some groovy looking animation and a mix of stylised drawings and computer renderings, mostly in a hypersaturated palette of electric blue and magenta pink. This colour scheme persists throughout, cropping up in the live-action sequences, too, giving the whole film a pop art, candy-coloured artificiality that’s pleasingly retro. The film’s other heroes, a teenager named Hamster (Skylan Brooks) and his tough older sister Indigo (Zolee Griggs) feel drawn very much from a 21st-century gallery of archetypes, what with Hamster aspiring to make it big as an influencer online while Indigo is breaking through the glass ceiling as a female drug dealer, working for a local thug known only as the Manager (Glenn Howerton, hamming it up amusingly). Writer-director Adam Egypt Mortimer moves seamlessly between the two registers, although, in truth, the last act feels breathless and rushed. Mumblecore star Amy Seimetz (Upstream Color) makes it all worthwhile with a turn that doesn’t get that much screen time but leaves a huge impression. • Released on 22 February on digital platforms.",Archenemy,FILM
Pelé review – valedictory tribute to Brazilian football great,"Here’s a slightly more upscale contribution to the deluge of feature-length football documentaries that have flooded our screens in the last few years. Pelé is the apex talent who underpinned Brazil’s rise to unquenchable glory in the 1960s, culminating in the epic 1970 victory over Italy in the World Cup final – itself crowned by the endlessly replayed Carlos Alberto goal set up by Pelé’s cute lay-off: the cherry on the icing of the cake of football’s golden age. In truth, Pelé is’s stardom was partly founded on his smiley, boy-next-door persona and he is a fundamentally undramatic figure – certainly compared to the chaotic lord-of-misrule that was Diego Maradona, his only serious rival in the greatest-of-all-time stakes. Consequently, this admiring profile is considerably more sedate than Asif Kapadia’s rollicking biography of Maradona, though benefiting from an extensive interview with Pelé, who is now unable to walk without assistance. While Pelé’s footballing feats – inspiring Brazil to three World Cup wins, spending almost his entire career knocking in more than 1,000 goals for the same small Brazilian club, a brief foray to New York in the mid-70s – may seem to belong to ancient history, there’s a comfort-blanket familiarity about running through them once again. Where this film does turn up interesting material is by filling in the context of Brazil’s turbulent history in the 60s and highlighting Pelé’s participation in legitimising the military coup. Pelé maintains his ingenuous stance was entirely non-political, but there is a degree of bitterness on show from contemporaries who didn’t have his celebrity privilege. And it’s eye-opening to see the tensions preceding the 1970 World Cup, given Brazil’s triumph, seemed pre-ordained. But Pelé still possesses plenty of untarnished lustre as, arguably, the world’s first black sporting superstar, and the gold standard for footballing achievement for decades. (The Viagra ads he did at the turn of the millennium somehow don’t get a mention.) This valedictory film allows sober recognition for all that he did. • Available from 23 February on Netflix.",Pelé,FILM
Blush review – midlife crisis drama leaves you discontent and unfulfilled ,"As the lead turn in this burb-midlife crisis dramedy, Wendi McLendon-Covey repeatedly does a facial expression which can best be called stunned-discontentment-and-incredulity. It is, if nothing else, appropriate for the very eventful script from writer-director Debra Eisenstadt, that packs in loads of ideas and situations, and brings us to a series of contrived seriocomic crises, after which the dramatic temperature is reset to normal in the succeeding scene. At one stage McLendon-Covey’s character gets hit by a car, and simply limps away with the same satirically grumpy face and a bruise to show for it. It’s not totally clear if the surreal effect is intentional. McLendon-Covey plays Cathy, a woman who is bored and unfulfilled in her uptight marriage to Matthew (Steve Little, the dorky teacher Stevie Janowski from TV’s Eastbound &amp; Down) and anxious about her relationship with her teen daughter Tara – a very good performance from Kate Alberts. When she goes cat sitting for her querulous sister Gail (Catherine Curtin), Cathy finds herself fascinated by Gail’s dodgy neighbours: substance abuser Gemma Jean (Christine Woods), her husband Paul (Graham Sibley) and their teen son Xander (Max Burkholder). Gemma Jean shares inappropriately with Cathy, and both Paul and Xander seem attracted to her. Blush plays out along the classic American Beauty lines: menopausal sexual adventure for the grownups in ironic parallel with a disruptive emotional awakening for the teens a generation below. Tara even does an outrageously sexy group dance on the high-school stage which is taken straight from the Oscar-winning film. Matthew seems entirely enraptured by this, incidentally – odd, considering how cross he is later about Tara’s apparent relationship with a much older boy. In the end, this movie doesn’t really go anywhere or do anything. • Released on 22 February on digital platforms.",Blush,FILM
The Sinners review – inept teen horror dead on arrival,"Several past-it tropes from 1990s and 00s teen horror films strut the corridors of high school once more in this debut by director Courtney Paige. In a devoutly Christian small town, local preacher’s daughter Grace Carver (Kaitlyn Bernard) rebels against her conservative community by wearing scarlet lipstick and conducting a strenuously titillating affair with her BFF (very Cruel Intentions). The actual scandal though is her cultish clique, the Sins (very The Craft), founded with six of her naughtiest classmates. The group is so named because each member is reputed to embody a different one of the seven cardinal vices. Flirtatious Grace is Lust, rich girl Katie is Greed and so on. When “Pride”, AKA Aubrey (Brenna Llewellyn), is perceived to have transgressed their code – by recording her innermost thoughts in a leather-bound journal (very Mean Girls) – Grace and her acolytes commence a ruthless bullying campaign that culminates in Aubrey’s disappearance on the edge of the woods. The town’s well-meaning but bumbling sheriff, Fred Middleton (Aleks Paunovic), investigates (a nod to Scream’s Deputy Dewey), as a remorseful Grace scrambles to destroy any evidence of her involvement. Then the rest of the Sins start turning up dead, their corpses prettily accessorised with a single rose pressed between their lips. That would be enough to keep most girls quiet, but not Aubrey, whose verbose beyond-the-grave narration commits many sins against cinema’s first commandment of “show, don’t tell”. There is also one of those dastardly villains who, once unmasked, can’t resist putting off an escape to lay out their entire warped plan in detail. Even with such lengthy explanation, the characters’ motivations and plot twist doesn’t make much sense. At least The Sinners’ sexy-schoolgirl-corpse aesthetic – part Twin Peaks, part Ariana Grande music video – is too ineptly executed to truly offend. • Available from 22 February on digital platforms.",The Sinners,FILM
Rocks romps home at British independent film awards,"The much-praised London-set teen drama Rocks has emerged as the lead winner of the British independent film awards (Bifas), which were announced on Thursday in a virtual ceremony hosted by actor Tom Felton.

Ali also won the award for most promising newcomer. Bakray, however, was surprisingly beaten in the race for the best actress award by Wunmi Mosaku, who co-starred in the Netflix refugee horror His House, which won four Bifas. Remi Weekes, the film’s writer-director, took home the best director award, and the film also won best effects and best production design. Next in number of awards with three was The Father, a study of dementia starring Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins won best actor, and the film won best screenplay and best editing. The night was a personal triumph for Riz Ahmed, who – despite losing out as best actor for rap drama Mogul Mowgli – took home the debut screenwriter award for the same film (for which he was jointly credited with the film’s director, Bassam Tariq) as well as the best British short film award for The Long Goodbye which he co-created to accompany his acclaimed album of the same name.

Zappa review – under the skin of the wild man of American rock,"This documentary about the hugely prolific Frank Zappa, directed by Alex “Bill Preston Esq” Winter, takes an unusually serious-minded approach to the celebrated wild man of 1960s and 70s American rock: ranging from his unusual childhood, to his ferocious work ethic, to his political-sphere interventions, this is a fruitful attempt to get under the skin of a figure who is renowned for lurking eccentrically at the music industry’s periphery. One thing it doesn’t focus much on is the music itself; perhaps the ongoing devotion of Zappa’s hardcore fans means there’s no compelling reason to introduce the work to a new generation. In Winter’s eyes, Zappa’s oddness was set early: the son of a chemical engineer who worked for an army poison gas lab, his musical interests were sparked by an album of experimental percussion by modernist composer Edgar Varèse (the exact quote: “the most frightening, evil, vile thing a human being could listen to; I couldn’t understand why people didn’t love it”); an early encounter with the law, which saw him ejected from the small-town studio he set up as a young man for supposedly agreeing to help make a “stag film”, set him on the way to embracing the counterculture in Los Angeles and later New York. The film is at pains to counter some of the more enduring Zappa myths: he was not some whacked-out hippy, avoided drugs, and worked with a focused dedication to realise his musical vision. The cost of this is spelled out: many of the musicians found him a distant presence, ready to ditch them once their purpose was served; his children had to pitch for his attention; and his wife Gail, who speaks here at length before her death in 2015, had to contend with Zappa’s well-known fondness for the groupie lifestyle and – to put it mildly – some unreconstructed views on women. Winter also devotes lengthy sequences to Zappa’s congressional testimony in opposition to labelling record lyrics, and his unlikely adoption as a cultural envoy by post-cold war Czechoslovakia. There’s perhaps a little too much telling us what a genius Zappa was without really letting us hear for ourselves; this perhaps also explains the stress laid on his “classical” compositions, as if to reinforce his serious-musician credentials. But there’s no denying Zappa’s personal charisma and devotion to his cause, nor his articulacy in its service. Winter has created a fascinating watch. • Available at Altitude.Film.",Zappa,FILM
Bad Tales review – horribly compelling urban fairytale,"There’s a diseased yellow cast to the photography here, a sawing anxiety in the score, which means that even a moment of joyous summer release – a water fight among children – is undermined by a lurking sense of unease. Bad Tales, the second feature film from Damiano and Fabio D’Innocenzo, is a slippery thing, an urban fairytale unfolding under cautionary storm clouds in a sweltering suburb of Rome. Three families, not friends exactly but neighbours in a state of churlish co-existence, are the focus of a story narrated by an unknown male. He claims that the tale comes from a girl’s diary, but seeds the possibility of untruths. There’s a trickle-down of toxicity in this disappointed backwater, which has as its source the men of the families. The children pick up on the resentment, the swaggering sexuality that bears a taint of aggrieved anger. What chance do these kids have? A pregnant teenager wears her parental unfitness with a mocking smirk; middle-school students Dennis and Alessia cling together as their father vents his unpredictable anger. And spindly Geremia struggles to talk to beautiful Viola, whose father discusses her academic mediocrity as if she weren’t present. Parental indifference is not attuned to the looming tragedy in this horribly compelling fable. Bad Tales is on Mubi",Bad Tales,FILM
Zappa review – a maverick sensibility,"Bill and Ted actor turned director Alex Winter brings a fan’s eye and a shared maverick sensibility to this suitably unruly documentary about rock musician and composer Frank Zappa. His music, it’s fair to say, is not for everyone, but the film succeeds in conveying the exhilarating connection felt by those who get it. Long-term Zappa collaborator Ruth Underwood plays the piano part of The Black Page, a piece described as being “the forefront of innovation in regard to rhythmic polymetric notation”. Her delighted smile when she nails it perfectly matches a photo of the same moment, on stage several decades previously, with Zappa beaming approval back at her. Winter had a lot to work with: Zappa kept an exhaustive archive of recordings and material, documenting every aspect of his wide-ranging career and frequently recalcitrant public persona. Key to the success of the film is the editing, a pinballing assault of free association, claymation and gleeful profanity, which goes some way towards recreating what it must have been like to spend time inside Zappa’s head. Zappa is available on Altitude.film",Zappa,FILM
IWOW: I Walk on Water review – freeform meditation on New York's dispossessed,"I Walk on Water is a hefty documentary project from artist and film-maker Khalik Allah: something that might be called an investigative meditation on the lives of the homeless, the marginal and the dispossessed in Harlem in New York City, and the film-maker’s own life. Lasting three hours and 19 minutes, it is an expansive collage of video, celluloid and 16mm, in colour and black-and-white, something close to underground cinema. Allah simply lets the camera roll open-endedly and talks to street people like the Haitian man nicknamed Frenchie (we never hear what his actual name is), whom he has photographed before. The director often uses the 125th Street subway station as his base of operations; he features rappers’ performances and also films the uniformed NYPD cops, whose faces are half-smiling masks of opaque indulgence. Allah brings his Italian girlfriend, Camila, into the story, recording his often agonised introspective conversations with her. (He reveals at one stage that apparently his film was going to be called “Camila”). He moreover bizarrely includes encounters with his own longsuffering parents: conversations during which he candidly reveals himself to be under the influence of shrooms and believes himself to be Jesus Christ – to his mother’s very considerable dismay. This sequence explains the title, and, also, on a slightly more serious level, could have something to do with his concerns for the lowly, the last whom Jesus said would be first. This is a film which has been described as “immersive”, though a sceptic might say that its sheer length means that audiences, however sympathetic, will inevitably at moments lose attention and de-immerse. Maybe some of it is redundant, and there are an awful lot of droning druggie conversations off-camera, including a very weird discussion about how awful brussels sprouts are. But the length is what gives it its texture, and its shapelessness is how it becomes exploratory, almost a real-time autobiography. Allah is asking profound questions, in his way, about what it is like to be people like Frenchie, to live outside the framework of connected prosperity. • Released on 26 February on digital platforms.",IWOW: I Walk on Water,FILM
Erēmīta (Anthologies) review – lockdown experiments of varying accomplishment,"Do not adjust your set. The long pauses of black screen during this studiedly serious anthology of experimental shorts made by cinematographers during the pandemic lockdown are deliberate. It’s been put together by the American-Egyptian director Sam Abbas, who invited five cinematographers to take part in his lockdown challenge, shooting a film on their phones. The result feels a bit like being fed a plate of arthouse vegetables, a collection of not always easy-to-watch films, randomly connected and with a total running time of 58 minutes that, to be honest, is a bit of a slog. The opening film is a purely experimental piece by Soledad Rodríguez, her camera prowling hungrily for images. She uses a filter or effect that makes even ordinary images look unsettlingly like a sci-fi or horror movie: in a wood, two dogs stand to attention and look like hounds of hell about to attack at any moment. Antoine Héberlé’s contribution, a self-conscious film with a new-wave feel about a woman sitting in her apartment listlessly staring out of her window, didn’t really work for me. Abbas has described the collection as being “about everything and nothing”. The film most obviously about something is directed by Alexis Zabé, the cinematographer behind the stunning images in Carlos Reygadas’s Post Tenebras Lux. Here he shoots an arresting mini-doc about a tent community of homeless people living in Venice Beach, Los Angeles. At the end, the camera lingers on a message attached to wire fencing: “Love. Be kind”. At first the letters seemed to me to be written in gold helium balloons. Actually, it’s yellow cordon tape – a hopeful message stamped all over with the words “caution”. I would happily watch 58 minutes of Zabé’s film, but in the main, these films would possibly work better on the walls of a gallery. • Released on 26 February on digital platforms.",Erēmīta (Anthologies),FILM
Woody Allen denies claims in Allen v Farrow HBO documentary ,"Woody Allen has rebutted renewed allegations, in the HBO documentary Allen v Farrow, that he sexually assaulted his daughter Dylan in 1992, calling the series “a hatchet job riddled with falsehoods”. In a statement to the Hollywood Reporter, Allen and his wife, Soon-Yi Previn, said that film-makers Amy Ziering and Kirby Dick had “spent years surreptitiously collaborating with the Farrows and their enablers to put together a hatchet job riddled with falsehoods”. They added: “As has been known for decades, these allegations are categorically false. Multiple agencies investigated them at the time and found that, whatever Dylan Farrow may have been led to believe, absolutely no abuse had ever taken place.” In a TV interview in 2018, Dylan Farrow denied she had been “brainwashed” or “coached” into making allegations against Allen. Allen v Farrow, which aired its first of four episodes on Sunday on HBO in the US, is described by Ziering and Dick as an investigation into the allegations, which emerged during the custody battle after Allen’s separation from Mia Farrow in 1992. Ziering also denied their film was “a collaboration … with [Dylan Farrow] or the family”. There has been no response so far from the Farrows regarding the claims made by Allen and Previn about the documentary. Allen has consistently denied any allegations of sexual abuse against Dylan Farrow, which were investigated in 1992-93 by Connecticut state police, the Child Sexual Abuse Clinic of Yale New Haven Hospital, and the New York Department of Social Services; none concluded that sexual assault had taken place. Mia Farrow and her son Ronan appear in Allen v Farrow, while Allen and Previn declined to participate. The statement says Allen and Previn “were approached less than two months ago and given only a matter of days ‘to respond’. Of course, they declined to do so.” Dylan’s brother Moses, who has defended Allen from the allegations, also reportedly declined to appear in the film. The Guardian spoke to the documentary’s lead investigator Amy Herdy who claims to have reached out to Allen’s team back in June 2018 but “got crickets back”. She added: “I know that they got my requests because I had an assistant on the phone” who said they were getting her emails. Ziering and Dick have previously worked together on a string of hard-hitting documentaries about sexual abuse, including the Oscar-nominated The Invisible War, which focused on rape in the US military and The Hunting Ground, about sex assaults on university campuses.",Woody Allen,OTHERS
Ayouni review – a raging lament for Syria's 'disappeared',"Director Yasmin Fedda, who is from a Palestinian and Syrian background and lectures in film at Queen Mary University of London, has created a powerful and urgent documentary tribute to those who have been “forcibly disappeared” by the Assad regime in Syria, estimated to be around 150,000 since 2011. Fedda focuses on two people: dissident writer and computer programmer Bassel Khartabil, who was abducted in October 2015 in Damascus, and Father Paolo Dall’Oglio, the hugely popular and admired Christian priest who was taken in July 2013 in Raqqa. She uses existing video of these two, from various family members and organisations, along with her own footage showing the campaigns of the loved ones left behind with their burden of anguish and their need to battle on and bring these crimes to the world’s attention. In particular, we talk to Bassel’s wife, Noura Ghazi, and Paolo’s sister Immacolata, or Machi. Their testimony is deeply moving: they are courageous, stoic, determined. It is heartbreaking to see Noura, so young and joyous in Bassel’s company, then careworn and marooned in a spiritual void of uncertainty about whether Bassel is alive or dead. It is wrenching also when Machi tells us of the choice she has to make: to stop thinking about her brother or to endure the pain of continuing to campaign, to post online, to keep the search alive, but with it the danger of unthinkably raw grief. As she poignantly puts it: “I prefer to take the risk of hoping.” The forcibly disappeared of Syria emerge from this film as comparable to los desaparecidos of Argentina in the dark days of the junta – a tyranny that was brought low at least partly due to the women who bore public witness to those taken.

Emperor review – adventure trumps accuracy in civil war biopic,"“The history of the civil war was written by white men to serve their own agenda. It’s time for a black man to tell his own story.” The narrative emancipation practised by Emperor, though, is questionable, considering that more than a few liberties are taken with the story of Shields “Emperor” Green, the escaped slave who was hanged after storming Harpers Ferry with John Brown in 1859. Sadly, they are not taken with the same revisionist audacity as Quentin Tarantino gave Django Unchained, with whom this shares a producer. Here, rewriting history seems to consist solely of insisting that exciting gunpowder-keg explosions were a daily occurrence in the 19th century. Dayo Okeniyi plays Green, who snaps and murders his overseer after the latter whips his son for reading a book. Fleeing for his life, he tries to tap into the underground railroad – and is soon dogged by an elite bounty hunter (Ben Robson) chasing the $1,000 price tag on his head. Director Mark Amin keeps Green on a strict action-movie schedule, packing his journey with swamp manhunts, caravan chases and bank robberies. Historical accuracy obviously isn’t the point, and the pursuit is undeniably rousing, if not subtle. Next to the statuesque Okeniyi, almost every white character looks like a raddled Confederate cadaver. One thing Emperor is sharp on is the pressure on slaves – and former slaves – to pursue their own self-interest at the expense of their peers. “What is more important – freedom for one man or freedom for all man?” asks James Cromwell’s Brown when the less radical abolitionist Frederick Douglass (Harry Lennix) offers Green passage to Canada. More fine-grained attention to the psychological atmosphere of the period could have made this an antebellum The Fugitive, every scene full of fear and desperation. Instead, it’s merely watchable, a low-stakes contribution to the current renaissance of African American film-making. • Emperor is available on digital platforms from 1 March. • This article was amended on 24 February 2021 to correct the spelling of Frederick Douglass’s first name.",Emperor,FILM

"Jailbreak review – the great, ingenious, Chilean escape","Here is the story of the biggest prison escape in Chilean history. In 1990, during the final days of the Pinochet regime, 49 leftwing prisoners escaped from a Santiago jail via a 60-metre-long tunnel dug over 18 gruelling months with spoons and screwdrivers. Local newspapers called it “The Great Escape” and “An Escape for the Movies”; the event was a natural for the big screen. Jailbreak digs into this historic episode with thrilling oomph and awe. Much of the film’s pleasure derives from the ingenious ways the prisoners manage to dig the tunnel right under the noses of the watchful, sadistic guards. At one point, the crew use a pornographic poster to cover the opening to the crawl space where they would ultimately stack more than 50 tonnes of dirt. The guard takes no notice; he quips that the model is still wearing too many clothes. Later, the camera pulls back to reveal the real scope of the tunnel, all masterfully rigged with lights. Goosebumps. Although the construction of the tunnel overshadows the performances, the clash of personalities between the leaders of the break is engrossing enough. The quiet León Vargas (Benjamín Vicuña), who is still suffering from the loss of his family under the dictatorship, engineers the tunnel’s mechanics; the brassy Rafael Jiménez (Roberto Farías) remains the operation’s driving force. The female characters – the prisoners’ lawyer (Amparo Noguera) and Jiménez’s wife and outside liaison person (played by Francisca Gavilán) – add balance and nuance to an otherwise male-centric film. Exciting as it is, Jailbreak is hampered by sequences with stilted, over-expository dialogue that don’t do a great job of setting up the historical and ideological background; other than the prison conditions and the harsh death penalties awaiting seven of the prisoners, we don’t know much about the political stakes outside the jail’s four walls. Nevertheless, it’s an entertaining watch – particularly for a feature directorial debut – that alternates between moments of private turmoil and collective fervour. • Jailbreak is release on 1 March on digital platforms.",Jailbreak,FILM
Shadowland review – hopelessly inept Highlands horror,"Not to be confused with Shadowlands, the 1993 drama featuring a heartbroken CS Lewis, or Shadowland, a documentary about a knife-maker, or any number of films called Shadowland. Even without seeing them, you can be assured that this particular Shadowland is, at least in terms of production values, the worst. Almost thrillingly inept, writer-director Simon Kay’s amateurish horror feature would be more amusing to criticise if only it weren’t so lacking in any signs of talent, from the impenetrable storytelling that jumps around chronologically, to the clueless editing, to the cinematography that looks as if it was done on an early smartphone. And the acting? Peerlessly inexpressive, unconvincing, dreary. In a supposedly ancient Scottish forest (the kind of ancient forest where all the trees are growing equally spaced in straight lines), there’s an abandoned military research base where an ill-defined, barely seen evil creature is running around killing anyone who wanders into its path. An American ambassador (David E Grimes), his wife and two grown-up kids, are being accompanied by a cadre of soldiers when – wouldn’t you know it? – a kidnapping goes wrong. The survivors run into a strange-looking old man (Tony Greengrass) who is revealed to be, I think, the same person we see in flashback as a younger man (Gordon Houston) arriving at the base to work on some experiment. It’s hard to be sure because nothing makes any sense. This really looks like the result of something written on the back of a beer mat and made over a drunken weekend in someone’s uncle’s garden. • Shadowland is released on digital platforms on 1 March.",Shadowland,FILM
NHS warns against Gwyneth Paltrow’s 'kombucha and kimchi' Covid advice ,"Gwyneth Paltrow has been urged to stop spreading misinformation by the medical director of NHS England after she suggested long Covid could be treated with “intuitive fasting”, herbal cocktails and regular visits to an “infrared sauna”. The Hollywood star, who markets unproven new age potions on her Goop website, wrote on her latest blogpost that she caught Covid-19 early and had since suffered “long-tail fatigue and brain fog”. Paltrow said that after turning to the advice of a “functional medicine practitioner”, she was told “this was a case where the road to healing was going to be longer than usual”. She then embarked on a “keto and plant-based” diet, involving fasting until 11am every day, “lots of coconut aminos” and sugar-free kombucha and kimchi. Paltrow went on to recommend her brand’s Madame Ovary supplement and Seedlip, “the incredible herbal nonalcoholic cocktails”. She added: “I’m doing an infrared sauna as often as I can, all in service of healing.” Paltrow also suggested there was evidence for the efficacy of such a diet. “I’ve been doing major research and finding some great stuff to support what I’m doing,” she wrote. However, her unproven advice prompted a stern rebuke from Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director for NHS England, who urged influencers such as Paltrow against spreading misinformation. He said: “In the last few days I see Gwyneth Paltrow is unfortunately suffering from the effects of Covid. We wish her well, but some of the solutions she’s recommending are really not the solutions we’d recommend in the NHS.” Powis added: “We need to take long Covid seriously and apply serious science. All influencers who use social media have a duty of responsibility and a duty of care around that. “Like the virus, misinformation carries across borders and it mutates and it evolves. So I think YouTube and other social media platforms have a real responsibility and opportunity here.” In 2018 Goop agreed to pay a substantial settlement over unproven claims about the health benefits of the infamous vaginal eggs it was selling. It claimed the eggs could balance hormones, regulate menstrual cycles, prevent uterine prolapse, and increase bladder control, according to officials in Santa Clara, part of a group of California district attorneys who filed the lawsuit. Last year she began selling a This Smells Like My Vagina candle through her Goop brand. She later revealed that the follow-up would be called This Smells Like My Orgasm.",Gwyneth Paltrow,PERFORMER
Wrong Turn review – skull-crushing Appalachian horror,"This horror is pretty crass and generic, yet there is occasionally a wacky gonzo energy to this film by director Mike P Nelson, the seventh movie in the Wrong Turn slasher franchise, which began back in 2003 in the classic 1970s style of The Hills Have Eyes. This is also a reboot or summation in that it is called, simply, Wrong Turn, like the first one, without the number seven. Charlotte Vega plays Jen, a fresh-faced twentysomething hiking the Appalachian trail with a group of her friends. After rashly deciding to go off the official path, into the dense woodland, in search of a “civil war fort” (an ominous destination if ever there was one), they are gruesomely set upon by sinister hillbillies and mountain men dressed in weird animal furs and skulls like Trumpites invading the Capitol. Jen’s earnest dad, Scott (Matthew Modine), comes looking for her, only to discover something horrifying about who these mountain folk actually are and the strange alternative society they have built in secret deep in the forest wilderness for a century or more. This film really is horribly violent, with people getting their skulls crushed, heads bashed in, ribcages collapsed and generally mutilated in all sorts of loathsome ways. It is by-the-numbers stuff, but the film starts to up its game when we find ourselves in the weird proto-postapocalyptic society in the hills that has stayed the same since the 19th century (but which, apparently, was founded on non-racial lines in opposition to the Confederacy and the Union). Jen gets a bit of a story arc that goes a little beyond the survivalist pieties of the Final Girl. It’s a bit silly and queasy, but the narrative motor keeps humming. • Wrong Turn is on digital platforms from 26 February.",Wrong Turn,FILM
The Stylist review – an insipid thriller three decades out of fashion,"Sadly, nowadays there is no video for this to go straight to. Maybe someone should reopen a branch of Blockbuster just so a VHS copy can be ceremoniously placed in a bargain bin by the exit. The Stylist lumbers heavily along as if it’s wearing deep-sea diver’s boots, a queasy mash-up of serial-killer nightmare with 90s-style Single White Female-esque thriller. The acting and directing are entirely terrible, the editing and pacing are so sluggish you’ll feel as if you’re going into a persistent vegetative state, the plot is tiresomely unthought-through, the split-screen shots don’t work and the musical score is so pointless and undifferentiated it sounds like elevator muzak. I do have to admit that the final wedding scene, with one particular cutaway shot of a beaming bridesmaid, does have a certain OTT outrageousness. But that doesn’t justify the price of admission – or of sitting through all that has gone before. Najarra Townsend plays a hair stylist named Claire who is really good at her job. Her way with the scissors and other sharp implements, and her tender scalp caresses, sooth her customers. But she has a habit of offering after-hours haircuts in the salon, giving her customers a late-night glass of wine into which she’s slipped something, and taking Hannibal-style trophies. Then, slightly out of the blue – and this doesn’t really mesh with her creepy MO – Claire forms an obsession with one of her regulars, Olivia (Brea Grant), which this leads to something truly yucky. Exasperatingly, this film fails to tell us something basic: how exactly is Claire moving and disposing of the corpses once she’s done her horrible number on them? Is she burying them? Keeping them in a freezer? One of her victims is the subject of “Missing” fliers put up around town – but later we hear that this same person is getting a “funeral”. So … they found the body? Or what? Either way, this movie has no vital signs. Available from 1 March on Arrow.",The Stylist,FILM
Gatecrash review – opaque auto-accident drama,"Adapted from a play by Terry Hughes, this pent-up and then purgatively violent drama revolves around an offscreen car accident that sends a handful of characters colliding into each other. Clearly already dancing a miserable tango of abuse, Nicole (Olivia Bonamy) and Steve (Ben Cura) come home to their isolated house in the country, decorated in shades of taupe, grey and plum to match Nicole’s bruises, after Steve runs over a stranger on the road on the way home from a party. Though he was driving and chose to leave the scene of the crime, he still blames Nicole for distracting him with an argument. As this display of toxic masculinity approaches its full operatic pitch, suddenly there’s someone at the door: policeman (Samuel West), all creepy chirpy banter, who’s wondering if they’ve seen anything strange lately. There’s quite a lot that’s strange here, including repeated chunks of dialogue that transfer from one character to another, the opaque motivations of several characters, and whether some of this is meant to be fantasy or just heavy-handed melodrama. Plus, there’s a mysterious second-act appearance from another creepy character named Sid, played by Anton Lesser (best known on TV for Game of Thrones and Wolf Hall). Lesser is the best thing in this, giving a layered performance that hints at a backstory that the actor at least may have conceived in detail even if the screenplay, credited to director Lawrence Gough and Alan Pattinson, doesn’t give him much to work with. Perhaps this worked better on stage, but as film it’s neither fish nor fowl, lacking neither the surrealism to give it a Lynchian dream logic, nor the psychological insight to make it work as realism. • Available on digital platforms.",Gatecrash,FILM
The Dark and the Wicked review – devilishly directed farmhouse horror,"The Dark and the Wicked is a nastily effective, lo-fi, psychological haunted house horror about a malevolent force that takes up residence in a remote Texas farmhouse (shot at director Bryan Bertino’s family home). There is possibly not a single scary moment here that will be new to horror fans, but Bertino directs with such technical flair that I yelped at most of them – and half-missed the others, eyes squeezed tight shut. Louise (Marin Ireland) is on a visit back to the farm where her bedridden dad (Michael Zagst) is dying. Her brother, Michael (Michael Abbott Jr), is here too, a hulking lunk in a lumberjack shirt who seems emotionally avoidant, rarely making eye contact. Everything about the farm feels creepy as hell: the sheep bleating in the barn, homemade wind chimes rattling. The land itself has a forsaken feel, abandoned by the younger generation. Refreshingly, Bertino’s emotionally literate script gives the family very real dynamics. Drinking beer on the porch one evening, the siblings experience a stab of guilt, realising how long it’s been since they last visited. What’s strange is that their mother (Julie Oliver-Touchstone) isn’t exactly welcoming. “I told you not to come,” she hisses. In her diary, she’s been writing about a diabolical force taking over the house. The first gruesome scare involves the mother chopping carrots with a very large knife. Worse is to come from the evil presence (named the Wicked in the credits), who the audience sees in the shadows in a couple of blood-run-cold “he’s behind you” moments. Wisely, Bertino exercises restraint, not revealing too much about the Wicked. But that does leave his script open to the accusation of narrative thinness – and with the bodies piling up, you’d expect a cop or two to come sniffing around. • Released on 25 February on Shudder.",The Dark and the Wicked,FILM
Paramount to launch streaming service for new and old films,"Paramount has become the latest studio to unveil plans for a streaming service it hopes will help maximise profits on films whose release has been affected by the pandemic. Paramount Plus, which launches on 4 March, will feature archive content as well as carrying new movies 30 days after theatrical release – or 45 for tentpole titles. These include oft-postponed releases such as Top Gun: Maverick (due in cinemas on 2 July), A Quiet Place II (17 September) and Mission: Impossible 7 (19 November). “Audiences are changing in their habits and we want to make sure that these films are available when they’re fresh after a full theatrical run,” Paramount Pictures CEO Jim Gianopulos told Variety on Wednesday. Mission: Impossible 7 wrapped filming last week after a long-running shoot involving multiple restarts in a wide variety of locations. Post-production is now under way in London ahead of the proposed release over the Thanksgiving weekend holiday in the US. The move is another blow for cinema owners seeking to shore up trade post-lockdown. Disney and Warner Bros have already launched popular streaming services either in tandem with a cinematic release or – particularly in the US, where most venues have been closed for almost a year – as standalone platforms. Universal recently struck a deal with key US chains that would allow them to stream new titles after only 17 days in cinemas. Paramount also announced TV series based on hit movies such as The Italian Job, Love Story, Flashdance and Fatal Attraction.",Paramount,FILM-CREW
"Hellraiser: Judgment review – diminishing, misogynist returns for classic franchise","There have been so many additions to the Hellraiser franchise since the first one debuted in 1987 that we’ve now got to the stage when it’s best not to remind viewers how many there have been, lest the young uns think it’s some kind of musty Gen X thing that just won’t die. Which it kind of is, to be honest. This latest contribution, written and directed by makeup effects specialist Gary J Tunnicliffe, feels like a pretty degraded mutation from the original concept. Where the first few Hellraisers had an interesting if somewhat icky erotic tang to them – alluding to S&amp;M/fetish culture as much as horror, and featuring female protagonists – Judgment is less about desire than just straight-up misogyny and gory, gross-out money shots. The franchise’s iconic demon Pinhead is back once again (of course), played here by Paul T Taylor. But he’s more of a background presence as an assortment of other demons, including one played by Tunnicliffe himself, take over the business of bedevilling humanity via what sounds like insurance industry-based methods of torture, given they call themselves The Auditor, The Assessor and whatnot. Among the living, the main characters are a trio of cops – two of them brothers Sean (Damon Carney) and David Carter (Randy Wayne), as well as rookie Christine (Alexandra Harris) – who are investigating what seems to be a serial killer case. One of the first victims is a young woman (Grace Montie) who dares to be sexually active, and ends up with her lapdog and mobile phone sewn up inside her body. Elsewhere, there’s a trio of supernatural vamps who sit in judgment over souls and have fake blood hosed on to their large naked breasts, which I guess is one way to get your jollies. The dialogue is execrable, which partly excuses the inert performances; the sets – including one that looks like a shop’s filament bulb display – are more interesting to look at than the actors. • Released on 22 February on digital platforms.",Hellraiser: Judgment,FILM
Restless Natives review – classic Scottish comedy is a reminder of a sweeter era,"“Guns are for LASSIES! Nobody seems to put the BOOT in any more!” This rousing manifesto for muscular non-armed crime of the traditional sort comes from one of the hardened villains that surreally pop up in this intensely likable Scottish caper from 1985, with a soundtrack from Big Country. It was part of a boom in Britmovie comedy of the era when Scotland was becoming caustically alienated from Thatcherite England, and which gave us Bill Forsyth’s Gregory’s Girl, Comfort and Joy and Local Hero. The script from Ninian Dunnett was originally the winning entry of a screenwriting competition (Dunnett in fact wrote no more for the screen after this, and became an author and social historian) and it was directed by the anglophile and caledonophile American Michael Hoffman. Joe Mullaney plays Ronnie, a likely Edinburgh lad who works in a joke shop, like Miranda Hart. He and his nervy mate Will (Vincent Friell) decide they’re sick of being poor and resolve to tour around the countryside on their motorbike, in a clown and wolfman disguise, robbing tourist buses – which they do so politely that they become folk heroes. Bryan Forbes and Nanette Newman provide cameos as a grumpy English couple who assume they’re a student “rag week” stunt and fob them off with one of the big 50p coins of the day. But when the lads’ criminal career takes off, a mean American cop over here on holiday, played by Ned Beatty, gets on their trail with his flashy big mobile phone (“It’s the Man from UNCLE!” giggle the local officers) and tension emerges between the two bandits. Will finds himself romantically involved with Margot (Teri Lally), a tour guide on a bus he’d just stuck up, and Ronnie falls in some with serious villains, led by a deadpan Mel Smith. Kids keep cropping up in the action – unsentimental and unimpressed by both the cops and the robbers. It’s the kind of gentle and yet sweetly funny use of children that British cinema just doesn’t do any more. Ronnie and Will are in some ways innocent forerunners of Renton, Spud et al in Trainspotting, and also a prototype Wallace and Gromit. Released on 1 March on digital platforms.",Restless Natives,FILM

Moxie review – Amy Poehler's high-school comedy plays it straight,"A high-school movie directed by Amy Poehler, the SNL comedy blackbelt who starred in Parks and Recreation? And who is incidentally the longtime performing partner of Tina Fey, who created the high-school classic Mean Girls? Is this going to be hilarious, or what? Sadly no. Solemnly based on a novel by YA author Jennifer Mathieu, Moxie could be called Nice Girls or Mutually Supportive Girls. Poehler herself has a small role as the single mom of a smart, lonely teenage girl called Vivian (Hadley Robinson) who is best friends with Claudia (Lauren Tsai), but whose intimacy with her is about to be damaged by her admiration for supercool new girl Lucy (Alycia Pascual-Peña), and her growing romantic situation with the impeccably right-on and pro-feminist supportive guy Seth (Nico Hiraga). Enraged by the boorish, sexist behaviour of the obnoxious football star Mitchell (Patrick Schwarzenegger), and the way he is indulged by the school, Vivian gets inspired by her mom’s long-since forgotten protest persona, and she starts a zine called Moxie and triggers a feminist revolution at the school which challenges her friendships and her sense of herself. The film is intensely, almost radically humourless, which is hard to ignore and in fact hard to bear, because of this film’s obvious resemblance to recent great movies like Booksmart or Lady Bird and particularly at times the hard-edged classic Election. In fact, Moxie feels like someone has put those films through a machine for extracting the comedy and the political satire. The movie tackles diversity, bullying and rape, but does it all very glibly. The target audience will surely be aware of the canon of superior, funny movies – and they will be baffled to see that Poehler doesn’t want to do something similar. • Released on 3 March on Netflix.",Moxie,FILM
Body Brokers review – drug abusers feed addiction to profit,"While films such as Traffic and Sicario focused on the supply side of the US war on drugs, John Swab’s third feature takes on the demand part of the equation. An expletive-spattered prologue fills us in on how the Obamacare act’s obligation for healthcare-providers to cover drug-abuse treatment created a market for recovery facilities worth $12bn a year in southern California alone. Swab then zeroes in on pasty Ohio junkie Utah (Jack Kilmer), plucked from heroin deadendsville and offered free rehab on the west coast by Wood (Michael Kenneth Williams), a broker acting on behalf of treatment centres to find addicts whose stay will be funded by insurance companies. After completing the programme, Utah graduates to becoming an apprentice to Wood and quickly realises the size of the fraud at hand. Wood hauls in patients at scale by offering them a cut of the insurance money; the system has no incentive to see them permanently recover because relapsing addicts mean repeat business. Wood also runs the same ploy on subcutaneous implants that inhibit opiate addiction, delivering a stream of punters worth $60,000 each to a local surgeon. The cynicism and human collateral of it all makes it the narco-industrial complex’s version of sub-prime. Emblazoned with mouthy Big Short-style info-dumps, and with a phone-selling scene reminiscent of The Wolf of Wall Street, Body Brokers outwardly seems to be aiming for high Scorsesian amoral operatics. But given the originality of Swab’s take, it’s a shame he couldn’t find the film a more appropriate style: at heart it is a more sober film intent on declaring its outrage. Kilmer, son of actors Val and Joanne Whalley, is a little bland in the ingenue role, not really digging into the sense that something malignant squirms beneath: not just substance dependency but also American addiction to capitalism – as hinted at by two uses of Public Image Ltd’s Rise on the soundtrack, with its cry that “anger is an energy”. But the Mephistophelean Wood is a great role for Williams; another man running game on the system, like his Omar from The Wire, but the moral compass long since pawned off. • Released on 8 March on digital platforms.",Body Brokers,FILM
"Lucky review – home-invasion horror that's a stand against violence, on repeat","This clever thriller teeters on the brink of abstraction, and walks a razor wire between horror and an incredulous absurdity meant to stand for how women must live in the modern world: the daily toll of living in fear of aggression, physical assault and withstanding the misogynistic structures that excuse them. At 2.29am one night, writer May (Brea Grant) peers over her balustrade to see an interloper, features blurred by a gel mask, staring up at her from the backyard. When she retreats to bed to tell husband Ted, he is disturbingly blase: “Honey, that’s the man. The man that comes every night and tries to kill us.” Ted manages to off the housebreaker with a pool cue, but his body disappears within seconds. The next night, and the next, May must do it all over again. As this Groundhog Day home invasion unspools, other characters display the same weird acceptance as Ted. More than the physical threat, it’s as if a new unfathomable reality is creeping in and violating her own. The police response is half-hearted and, adding to the conspiratorial air, Ted packs his bags after an argument: “I can’t change this. This is just how things are.” After these microaggressions, the next macro one is incoming; you might expect an It Follows-style air of inexorable dread to set in, but May remains upbeat. Grant also wrote the script as well as starring, and perhaps it’s this closeness to the core ideas that allows her to pivot spryly between romcom perkiness and a nauseated hesitancy that suggests the dislocation between normal life and its violent substrate. Towards the end, there’s a suggestion that May’s public tough-it-out credo – she is plugging a self-help book called Go It Alone – may be, in some sense, perpetuating these attacks. Possibly this is acknowledging that the strong-woman ideal championed by some quarters of the #MeToo movement comes at the expense of a more realistic and collaborative feminism. Natasha Kermani’s film is an elliptical but vehement statement on the post-#MeToo landscape. If the film’s story development is stymied by the narrative’s ultimate stasis, it is to all the better point out that the fight is far from finished. • Released on 4 March on Shudder.",Lucky,FILM
Biggie: I Got a Story to Tell review – Netflix doc sidesteps murder mystery for moving life story,"Perhaps posthumous legacy was always on the mind of late rapper Christopher “Notorious BIG” Wallace. His impactful debut album Ready to Die was followed by Life After Death, released 16 days after he was killed aged 24, in a still-unsolved, drive-by shooting. Yet while there have been several filmic attempts to capture this legascy –– including Nick Broomfield’s 2002 documentary Biggie &amp; Tupac and the 2009 biopic Notorious –– this Netflix release is the first to successfully sidestep the quicksand of murder mystery, and focus instead on what Wallace accomplished in life. Clearly redressing that balance was the motivation of at least two executive producers, including Wallace’s label boss and friend, Sean “Diddy” Combs, who early on declares: “This story doesn’t have to have a tragic ending.” It’s the contribution of Wallace’s mother, though, that’s particularly significant. Firstly in the form of family photos and stories illustrating a childhood spent between their Brooklyn neighbourhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant and her family’s home in Trelawny, Jamaica. There, young Wallace’s favourite uncle exposed him to sound system culture, while back in Brooklyn a jazz musician neighbour played him Max Roach and Clifford Brown. So that by the time a 17-year-old Biggie triumphed in the now-legendary rap battle on Bedford and Quincy, he was already “rhyming in a way that exudes all the finer qualities of a bebop drum solo”. More subtly though, Ms Wallace’s involvement gives permission for loyal associates to open up about the “gangster” part of “gangster rapper”. The darkest rumours are omitted, but there’s a detailed account of how Biggie came to dominate the local crack cocaine economy. These mid-90s, north-west Brooklyn specificities are fascinating and relevant; to Biggie’s art, certainly, but possibly also to his death. • Released on 1 March on Netflix.",Biggie: I Got a Story to Tell,FILM
Eye of the Storm review – moving film about Scottish painter in love with nature,"Scottish painter James Morrison died shortly before the completion of this affectionate documentary about his life and work which premiered at the Glasgow film festival, and it’s a fitting tribute to an articulate and self-effacing artist with an extraordinary affinity for Scotland’s everchanging land- and seascapes. It’s directed by Anthony Baxter, best known for highlighting the stubborn local resistance to Donald Trump’s golf course in Aberdeenshire with his You’ve Been Trumped films; this is something of a change of pace, while offering a not-dissimilar celebration of a very Scottish style of quiet, unfussy determination. Morrison’s story is interesting enough – born and raised in Glasgow, the son of ship’s fitter, who settled on the east coast and made epic trips to paint abroad, most notably to the Arctic – but it’s added to here by a plangent late-life twist: he is losing his sight, to the extent he can barely see what he is painting. True to form, Morrison accepted this as uncomplainingly as anything else – “irritating” is the strongest imprecation I can recall – and there’s something inexpressibly moving about the way he strokes a blank sheet of paper taped to his easel as if he can’t wait to get started. This is by no means an emotionless film, however: Morrison talks passionately about his wife, Dorothy, who died in 2015, and introduces us to a stormily epic landscape painting he calls “a portrait of grief”. In fact, all of Morrison’s work appears suffused with a kind of religious awe at his surroundings; Baxter artfully inserts beautiful drone shots of big skies, beetling cliffs and rolling hills as an echo of Morrison’s canvases. His Arctic sequence – huge chunks of ice, floating in intense dark blue seas – stands out in terms of spectacle, but Morrison preferred to talk in terms of his own “argument with himself”. As a painter, Morrison ought to be better known; this film should give his reputation and legacy a major uplift. • Released on 5 March in virtual cinemas and digital platforms.",Eye of the Storm,FILM
Backtrace review – Sylvester Stallone memory-loss heist caper is one to forget,"This plodding crime thriller came out in the US in 2018 but now is its chance to dazzle the UK with its dullness, straight-to-digital lost heist-money shenanigans and easy-to-see-coming plot twists. The whole thing is really waxy and sad, like the immobile face of co-star Sylvester Stallone; although the chance to enjoy the always interesting, never-as-big-as-he-should-have-been Matthew Modine, still looking pretty fly with a shock of white-and-gold hair, is very welcome. An opening blam-blam shootout establishes the stakes and premise: a gang of criminals and inside men plotted and pulled off a bank heist, only to get ambushed in the woods. The multimillion-dollar haul was never found, and the only survivor was Donovan MacDonald (Modine). Unfortunately, a head wound left him with profound retrograde amnesia, and he spends another seven years in a medical penitentiary not even able to remember the crime he’s accused of or, more importantly, where the money is. But nurse Erin (Meadow Williams), fellow inmate Lucas (Ryan Guzman) and shady security guard Farren (Tyler Jon Olson) bust him out of prison and administer an experimental drug that might help him recover his memory if it doesn’t kill him first. Meanwhile, Stallone plays a local cop who has been making one of those mood boards with mugshots and strings wound between push pins for years, and is now being compelled to work with an FBI agent (Christopher McDonald, always a hoot) with a dodgy moustache. The lawmen get far less air time than Modine and Co, which is a blessing really. Shot in Georgia, a popular filming location, and here playing itself for a change, the whole dreary thing looks as if it was put through an Instagram filter called Rotgut that makes everything look like it was soaked in weak coffee and bile. Somehow it fits the depressed, post-industrial mood that the climax takes place in an abandoned concrete factory. • Available from 5 March on Amazon Prime Video.",Backtrace,FILM
Last Moment of Clarity review – neo-noir in double trouble,"Brothers Colin and James Krisel and/or actor Zach Avery must be either very well financed or ridiculously persuasive because they’ve managed to pull together a supporting cast and budget for this debut thriller that far exceeds what the script seems to warrant. At heart, Last Moment of Clarity is a slight, imaginatively thin B-movie which doesn’t so much as allude to Alfred Hitchcock’s Rear Window and Vertigo as outright steal from them brazenly, ending up with a limp neo-noir that unfolds in the streets of Paris and classy apartments in Los Angeles. There are cameos from Brian Cox and Udo Kier, both great scene-stealing actors with many virtues other than accent mimicry, judging by the bizarre Scots-French mashup Cox tries out here that is only a hair’s breadth better than Kier’s eastern European-German gangster stylings. In any case, each of them appears only fleetingly; the bulk of the running time features Avery as a schlubby guy from New York named Sam who is hiding out in Paris. Sam mooches about the streets and works for bar owner Cox, all the while mourning the loss of his girlfriend, Georgia (Samara Weaving), who died at the hands of some lesser gangsters who work for Kier’s character, for reasons only gradually revealed. When he sees an actor named Lauren in a movie who looks just like Georgia, he becomes convinced that the two women are one and the same, and flies to La La Land to find out. Enter Kat, played by the mesmeric Carly Chaikin, who ends up palling up with Sam, giving Chaikin a chance to play another variation on the manic pixie dream girl type she played in Mr Robot. The script is full of such daft coincidences you keep expecting there will be a clever twist to explain – but no, it really is that lazily written.

Golden Globes suffers catastrophic drop in TV ratings,"To add to the difficulties besetting the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), early TV ratings for its Sunday-night Golden Globes awards show have dropped catastrophically from previous levels. They are likely to become the lowest since the show returned to NBC in 1996. Ratings agency Nielsen’s early “fast national” figures reveal that the show was 60% down on last year’s edition, drawing around 5.4 million viewers in the 18-49 age group, compared to 14.8 million for a similar estimate last year. The final total is likely to rise – the 2020 ratings ended at 18.5 million after all data was collected – but the 2021 total is set to fall well below the 14.7 million recorded in 2009. The poor audience figures underscore problems the HFPA are facing, having signed an agreement with NBC in 2018 that earns the organisation around $60m per year for eight years. Coronavirus restrictions forced the show into a virtual format, as well as a shift from its traditional January slot, depriving it of strong lead-in shows such as NFL games that helped boost its figures. The delays affecting the wider film industry also meant that the kind of commercial star-driven films that boost audience numbers were largely absent from this year’s ceremony. More seriously, the stream of criticism aimed at the HFPA for its perceived lack of diversity and ethical lapses, as well as its underwhelming response to complaints, could have long-term implications for the Globes’ credibility. A recent report in the LA Times suggested that the HFPA was unwilling to reform its membership policy for financial reasons. Tina Tchen, CEO of campaign group Time’s Up, criticised the HFPA for offering a “cosmetic” solution. Hosted by Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, the show resulted in big wins for Nomadland and its director Chloé Zhao, as well as The Crown, which took home four awards in the TV section.",Golden Globes,OTHERS
Justine review – tender Brighton-set queer romance with social angst,"Remember all-consuming crushes and awkward first dates? For young people in this age of self-isolation, such tender encounters might well be from another century. Chronicling a young lesbian romance set in a wintry Brighton, Justine is the remedy to the lack of such human contact. But it’s not all coffee dates and beach cuddles: this film is also a window on the harrowing cycle of addiction among displaced young adults. Justine (Tallulah Haddon), on probation and cut off from her family, is in a state of disarray. Awakened by loud bangs from the door – her landlord is asking for this month’s rent – Justine staggers dazedly, and fully clothed, out of the bath. Her lips bear a nasty cut, and her left arm is covered in swathes of white bandages. This dire scene opens to a more hopeful past, only three months earlier, when Justine first locks eyes with Rachel (Sophie Reid), a teacher-to-be, in a bookstore. Harsh financial realities immediately undercut the sweetness of this meet-cute. Rachel gasps as Justine slyly pockets a copy of Ovid’s Heroides. Despite their differing backgrounds, the two women quickly fall in love. The chemistry between Haddon and Reid, as well as their characters’ budding romance, makes Justine special and moving. With all the current industry talk about unnecessary sex scenes, the couple’s first night together has an awkward charm. It’s rare that a film captures so acutely the strange yet exhilarating feelings of two foreign bodies learning to adapt to each other, plus the difficulty of quickly disrobing your new lover of their jeans. In contrast, though, Justine’s descent into alcohol-fuelled self-destruction is handled somewhat less impressively, over-reliant on a series of sombre-sounding songs on the soundtrack. It’s a manipulative and hollow tactic that does a disservice to Haddon’s committed acting. Despite these heavy-handed moments, Justine remains a poignant study of a young woman struggling to stay afloat. • Released on 5 March on digital platforms.",Justine,FILM
Rishi Sunak extends insurance scheme for film and TV production,"The government has extended its £500m insurance scheme protecting film and TV productions in the UK against the cost of Covid shutdowns until the end of the year. Last year, more than £2.8bn was spent on making Hollywood blockbusters and prestige dramas in the UK, from Line of Duty, War of the Worlds and The Witcher to Jurassic World: Dominion, Mission: Impossible 7, Batman and the third instalment of the Fantastic Beasts franchise. The scheme, which was due to end in April, has so far supported more than 200 productions to get back up and running, saving an estimated 24,000 jobs since being launched in October. Despite the support, the total amount spent on film and high-end TV production fell by a fifth last year, as all productions across the UK were forced to close in the early months of the pandemic. However, the introduction of the scheme and industry-wide move to Covid-safe sets fuelled a £1.2bn spending spree in the final quarter of last year, the second highest ever quarterly spend on record, as broadcasters, Hollywood studios and streamers rushed to plug the pandemic gap in fresh content that viewers were facing.",Rishi Sunak,OTHERS
Into the Darkness review – a Danish family at war as the Nazis roll in,"Veteran film-maker Anders Refn has had top-billing as a director on a few films that aren’t terribly well known beyond his native Denmark. His reputation is mostly built on his long service as an editor with a very impressive filmography, having cut such films as Breaking the Waves and Antichrist for Lars Von Trier, as well as Sally Potter’s Ginger &amp; Rosa. He also happens to be the father of a more famous film-maker, the flamboyantly talented Nicolas Winding Refn (The Neon Demon, Drive). But judging by Into the Darkness, a historical drama directed and co-written by the elder Refn, father and son couldn’t have more different sensibilities. Not that this second world war-set family saga is at all bad; it’s just very conventional, and feels like it might have been originally conceived as a multi-part drama for television. At its best, the film’s soapy immersion in local history recalls the German epic TV show Heimat. At its worst, it’s a little dry and thumpingly didactic as the various members of the haut-bourgeois Skov family experience the consequences of their moral choices played out as war rages on, even in their relatively quiet corner of occupied Denmark. Patriarch Karl (the great Jesper Christensen) runs a factory that is doing well enough to keep his alcoholic wife, Eva (Bodil Jørgensen), in pretty frocks and nice tableware while their numerous children have pretty much everything they want. But once the Nazis roll into town, the family is fractured along ideological lines, making for some very awkward Christmas Eves. Ne’er-do-well eldest Aksel (Mads Reuther) finds himself more sympathetic to anti-Nazi leftists: at first because of his friendship with the housekeeper’s son (Cyron Melville) and later because he fancies a pretty Bolshevik (Kathrine Thorborg Johansen). Meanwhile, another son (Gustav Dyekjær Giese) joins the Danish army and fights side by side with the Germans, and naive daughter Helene (Sara Viktoria Bjerregaard) is smitten with a dashing German U-boat officer, much to the disgust of her mother. Assorted Jewish friends are carted off and killed, leaving various members of the family questioning their choices. If you have 152 minutes to sink into this morass of moral complexity and finely observed period detail, then it may well be worth it, although the ending is bizarrely, perplexingly abrupt. Perhaps there will be a follow-up feature. • Into the Darkness is released on 5 March on digital platforms.",Into the Darkness,FILM
The Final Stand review – old-fashioned flag-waving for Mother Russia,"Here’s a tale of chest-puffing courage and one-dimensional heroism from Russia during the second world war: an old-fashioned patriotic epic with slo-mo action scenes, intestines spewed on the battlefield and a soppy sentimental romance. It is based on real events in 1941, when more than 3,000 young military cadets were sent to the frontline to defend Moscow. Their mission was to buy time, holding off the Germans for five or six days until reinforcements arrived. Only a third survived. The cadets are still three months from graduating military school when the order comes to mobilise. These lads are future Red Army commanders, the brightest and the best. Two of them, best friends Lavrov (Artyom Gubin) and Shemyakin (Igor Yudin), are in love with the same girl, trainee doctor Masha (Lubov Konstantinova). Good-looking Lavrov is a crack-shot gunner, recklessly brave and romantic. Shemyakin is gentle and decent, a bit dull. You can guess which one Masha kisses in the broom cupboard. All three end up on the frontline, a town 200km from Moscow, as German tanks roll in. The soldiers around them are collection of cliches: there’s the strapping country boy dreaming of his mother’s borscht, and the speccy intellectual who translates when they capture a Nazi; otherwise, the Germans are a faceless horde. “This is not a war, it’s a massacre,” says an army doctor as the bodies pile up. Hopelessly outnumbered, the cadets are shot, burned alive, blown to bits. But director Vadim Shmelyov actually seems a bit squeamish about immersing his audience in the hell, death and chaos of war. He seems more interested in glorifying the cadet’s sacrifice and valour with a clumsy jingoistic script. Take the lad blinded in battle, a bandage wrapped around his head. He’s refusing to go to hospital, professing to the heavens as the music swells: “I still have my hands. I can load machine gun belts.” • Available from 8 March on digital platforms.",The Final Stand,FILM
Wander Darkly review – Sienna Miller drives psychological indie drama,"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind meets Ghost in this relationship indie from Tara Miele about a woman who is killed – or is she? – in a car crash. Sienna Miller is brilliant as gallerist Adrienne, who’s out on a date night (“it’s cheaper than couple’s therapy”) with her partner Matteo (Diego Luna) in Los Angeles. Frazzled and sleep-deprived from parenting their six-month-old Ellie, they’re bickering when their car hits an oncoming SUV. At the hospital, Adrienne has an out-of-body experience, watching as porters cover her bloodied body with a sheet and push the gurney along corridors to the morgue. Next, she steps out of the hospital into scenes of the future without her: Matteo at her funeral, baby Ellie grown into a teenager. Then Miele’s script yanks the rug away. Adrienne is at home, very much alive, a pharmacy of pills on the bedside table. It’s all been a dream. At least, that’s what everyone is telling her; she is concussed, disoriented. But Adrienne is convinced she’s dead. To help her make sense of what’s happening, Matteo suggests they relive the history of their relationship. But each brings their own resentment to the story, so the memory flashbacks change depending on who’s talking. As a couple, were they flawed from the beginning? “It’s so sad we fell apart,” says Adrienne, but actually the love story is the least interesting thing here – it’s a bit generic and insipid. What’s really impressive is how Miele pulls off the tone shift from naturalistic portrait of a couple to psychological drama to moments with just an undertone of horror – in one, Adrienne, checking the cot, sees the baby stiff and lifeless, and becomes hysterical. From the confusion and alarm on Matteo’s face you know that she is hallucinating. It’s clammily claustrophobic. Miller is at the heart of the film; her natural and believable performance touches so many emotions, and makes them all look so real. Adrienne can be funny about her condition. Watching a zombie movie she jokes: “These are my people.” But her terror of being pulled into nothingness is so convincing – which is quite a feat in a film that’s so contrived. • Wander Darkly is released on 8 March on digital platforms.",Wander Darkly,FILM
"My Donkey, My Lover & I review – eat, bray, love … and French manners","In a Paris primary school, a class of eight-year-olds sit behind their desks, eyes squeezed shut, counting to 20. At the back of the room their teacher, Antoinette (Laure Calamy), is getting undressed, slipping into silk frock for the school concert. “It’s not too much?” she asks the pupils. She’s having an affair with one of the dads – he’s married. Thus, with unparalleled Frenchness, begins this easygoing, warm comedy following Antoinette as she accidentally-on-purpose goes on the same donkey-trekking holiday as her lover’s family. As Antoinette bonds with her donkey, the movie evolves from gentle farce to journey of emotional growth. You might call it Eat Bray, Love – except it’s European, so there’s less pseudo-spiritual self-discovery and more drunken snogging. Antoinette is meant to be spending the first week of summer holidays alone with lover Vladimir (Benjamin Lavernhe) while his family are at the beach. Instead, when his wife surprises him with a family hiking holiday, Antoinette impulsively books herself a place, too: six days of 20km hikes, staying in hostels. She arrives in teeny denim hot pants and huge wedge sandals – there’s as much Bridget Jones in her DNA as Julia Roberts. But Vladimir is nowhere to be seen, and, predictably, it’s not love at first sight with her stubborn donkey Patrick either. There are some subtly pointed scenes at the beginning of the trek as a succession of guys mansplain to Antoinette how to manage her donkey. “Show him who’s boss,” says one handing her a whip. Instead, she uses her empathetic teaching style to win the beast over – and Calamy really grounds the movie with her funny, generous performance. The showdown with Vladimir and his wife, when it finally comes, is a lesson in the famous French casualness about infidelity. But Antoinette’s affair slips into insignificance quite quickly; the real chemistry here is with the four-legged ass, not the human one. • Released on 5 March on Curzon Home Cinema.","My Donkey, My Lover & I",FILM
Letter: Ronald Pickup obituary,"In 1979 I flew out to Sicily with the great Ronald Pickup for a long weekend – he to film a cameo as Stravinsky in a glossy biopic about the dancer Nijinsky, I as a film trade paper observer. On the flight, we joked about the potential pitfalls of such biopics, as in: “Hark, I think I hear Dickens writing his latest novel.” Cut to the set at the exquisite Bellini opera house in Catania, where Stravinsky sits at a (dummy) keyboard hammering out his latest composition. As he finishes with a flourish, the impresario Diaghelev (Alan Bates) inquires excitedly of its title. “I call it Le Sacre du Printemps,” Pickup replies portentously, adding a helpful subtitle for potential US audiences: “The Rite of Spring.” At which point I swear that Pickup caught my eye as I sat stifling giggles on the corner of the set.",Ronald Pickup,PERFORMER
The Last Shift – Richard Jenkins lifts up mismatched buddy film,"In writer-director Andrew Cohn’s deceptively modest drama The Last Shift, fast-food worker Stanley (Richard Jenkins) is finally calling it quits. He has worked the graveyard shift at Oscar’s Chicken and Fish for 38 years, but now he’s moving from Michigan to Florida to take care of his elderly mother; grease be gone. He’s proud of his tenure, slickly handling the drunks and the teens who ridicule him, rarely putting a foot wrong. But when he’s forced to train his replacement, the opinionated twentysomething Jevon (Shane Paul McGhie), Stanley starts to reconsider his life’s work and whatever meaning he might have attached to it. Jevon is dismissive of the job, forced into it while on probation after defacing a federal monument, and aiming to return to his love of writing when his circumstances allow. Jevon is smart but difficult, failing his beleaguered girlfriend and young son, unable to knuckle down and provide. It’s a mismatched buddy film, but not entirely unsuccessful thanks largely to Jenkins, who can play a role such as this with his eyes closed, and McGhie who captures a mixture of righteousness and despondency. It sort of ambles along with no great imprint until a sharpish left turn as Cohn tries to transform his small-town drama into something far greater. Talk of race and class clumsily enters the picture – Jevon is black while Stanley is white – with a rushed sequence of events suddenly trying to say something about the American divide. There’s an attempt to humanise bigotry that feels a little uneasy (perhaps surer hands could have tackled this differently), and the shift in focus feels a little underpowered, with a final note that lands with a whimper. • The Last Shift is released on 8 March on digital platforms.",The Last Shift,FILM
Iorram (Boat Song) review – swims with the ghosts of Scottish fishermen past,"Here is a gentle and ruminative, if slightly placid, documentary from director Alastair Cole, about the fishermen of the Western Isles and their way of life catching herring, eels and lobsters. Despite technological advances (and presumably Brexit – though it isn’t mentioned) this world has remained essentially unchanged for a century or more. One shot shows a man unselfconsciously smoking a cigarette as the catch is sifted through, quite as he might have done in 1921. What is notable about this film is that the only spoken language we hear is Scottish Gaelic. What this means, in practice, is that the scenes of the modern fishing industry and the fishing way of life are shown with a soundtrack of audio interviews (in Scottish Gaelic) with fishermen talking about their working lives, dating evidently from the 1940s or 1950s, though the film does not make the provenance of these tapes clear. The effect is to show a particular sort of modernity with the ghosts and the echoes of the past not so very far from the surface. Watching the film, I did wonder if the people we were seeing on screen were actually English speakers – but no, Scottish Gaelic is what they speak as well. That being the case, I would have very much liked to hear from them, speaking directly, about their world. It might have brought this film to life a bit more. And as for the archive audio material, I would have preferred to see historical footage and photography to go with that, although some relevant still images were produced for the closing credits. It’s a sensitive and respectful portrait. • Iorram (Boat Song) is released on 5 March on digital platforms.",Iorram (Boat Song),FILM
Hero's welcome: Liam Neeson to greet audiences for his new film in New York,"As cinemas in the US start to reopen, distributors and exhibitors are hoping to coax audiences back in front of screens with promises of enhanced safety, unmissable movies – and a personal welcome from the stars. Liam Neeson will personally greet cinemagoers who go and see his latest action thriller, The Marksman, at the AMC Lincoln Square in New York’s Upper West Side before screenings on Friday. “This is one for the diary,” Neeson told the Hollywood Reporter earlier this week. “It will be nice to welcome people. I think going to the cinema is a bit of a sacred experience. I’ve felt that way since I was a kid.” Neeson, 68, also confirmed that he had received his first dose of a coronavirus vaccine. New York is the second-largest market for moviegoing in the US, following Los Angeles, where cinemas remain closed. San Francisco’s screens have recently been given the all-clear to reopen with other cities on the west coast are thought to be not far behind. New York’s cinemas will be limited to 25% capacity, with a maximum of 50 people in each screening room. “The reopening of New York is a strong symbolic gesture to the theatre-going audience that it is okay to put your toe in the water,” said Tom Ortenberg, chief of Open Road/Briarcliff, which is distributing The Marksman in the US. The film opened in a number of territories around the world in January, where it has taken $16.4m to date. In a poll released on Thursday, the US’s National Research Group suggested moviegoer confidence is now at its highest level since last summer. Studios are capitalising on this sentiment, with a number moving planned release dates forward, following a year of postponements. The Peter Rabbit sequel, original scheduled for release in February 2020, has moved to 14 May 2021 from 11 June 2021, while the followup to A Quiet Place, which had been set for March 2020, moves forward from this September to 31 May. AMC is the largest cinema chain in the US. All of its 13 venues in New York will reopen on 5 March, with the Regal chain, which is owned by Cineworld, said to be opening an April reopening. Plans for cinema reopening in the UK remain contingent on the roadmap out of lockdown remaining unchanged. But current guidance means indoor cinemas in England would be allowed to reopen from 17 May, while outdoor cinemas would be permitted from 12 April. There is currently no date for reopening for cinemas in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.",Liam Neeson,PERFORMER
Coming 2 America review – Eddie Murphy makes a right royal turnaround ,"Thirty years have passed since the wedding to end all weddings closed Coming to America, John Landis and Eddie Murphy’s 1988 blockbuster comedy about an African prince who travels from the fictional African kingdom of Zamunda to New York to find a bride. A funeral lineup to rival Glastonbury occurs in the first act of this sequel, proving that the people of Zamunda still know something about spectacle. Co-written by Kenya Barris (Girls Trip) and directed by Craig Brewer (Hustle &amp; Flow, Dolemite Is My Name), this follow-up reverses the first film’s fish-out-of-water plot, with Murphy’s Prince Akeem and sidekick Semmi (Arsenio Hall) returning, briefly, to Queens to retrieve Akeem’s secret “bastard son” Lavelle (Jermaine Fowler). The comedy doesn’t work quite as well this way around, though Fowler is extremely likable as a sweet-natured slacker, channelling the endearing guilelessness of Murphy’s original Prince Akeem. Still, there are enough in-jokes and returning characters to keep fans happy (admirers of Randy Watson and his band Sexual Chocolate needn’t fret). A flashback involving Lavelle’s mum Mary (Ghostbusters’ Leslie Jones) and a pumpkin spice scented candle made me bark with laughter. The film proudly celebrates a wide swathe of Black culture; there’s a throwaway gag about cult TV sitcom Benson, a cameo from 90s R&amp;B group En Vogue, and gorgeous Ankara-print costumes designed by Ruth E Carter (Black Panther). In Zamunda, a woman cannot succeed to the throne or own her own business. To redress the original’s dated gender politics, Akeem’s three daughters (played by KiKi Layne, Akiley Love and Murphy’s real daughter Bella) challenge the sexism baked into their culture. It’s perhaps a milder film as a result, though its efforts feel sincere rather than pandering. • Coming 2 America is on Amazon Prime",Coming 2 America,FILM
Notturno review – a poetic critique of war in the Middle East,"In this striking documentary, Italian-American film-maker Gianfranco Rosi (Fire at Sea) explores the aftermath of war in the Middle East, filming Iraq, Kurdistan, Syria and Lebanon over a three-year period. Rosi’s method of patient observation allows him to make poetic connections across borders; a military drill that takes place at dawn is juxtaposed with a group of grieving mothers who wander an empty prison in an orderly procession. With no intervening text or voiceover, it can be hard to discern the individual locations and their different political contexts. Instead, Rosi’s broader critique of violence is implied through footage of a play performed by patients in a psychiatric hospital, and of a children’s art therapy class. He is more interested in the reverberations of conflict than the source, focusing on those who have suffered its effects directly. • On Mubi",Notturno,FILM

There is an incandescence and a buoyancy to the animation that elevates the formula.

Fukushima 50 review – simmering tribute to power-plant heroes,"Dangerously high concentrations of politeness are observed in this dramatisation of the 2011 disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Not only do most of the heroic “50” left behind to avert nuclear catastrophe constantly apologise for underperforming in acts of barely believable self-sacrifice, at one point a manager begs forgiveness for refusing to allow two employees to re-enter the radioactive zone after a failed first attempt. To the feckless western mind more likely to view Homer Simpson as the standard-issue nuclear power-plant employee, it’s a relief when – just for a second – a few Fukushima workers contemplate running away. It is possible director Setsurō Wakamatsu has taken the Hollywood route in portraying the staff as so infallibly courageous – though Fukushima 50 is adapted from journalist Ryusho Kadota’s book, which investigated the response to the earthquake and tsunami in more than 90 interviews. Possibly to avoid lawsuits from Tokyo Electric Power Company executives portrayed here as selfish and shamefully caught on a back foot, everyone in the film is fictionalised – except for prime minister Naoto Kan, though he is never referred to by name, and plant manager Masao Yoshida. Yoshida crucially defies orders and allows the reactors to be cooled with seawater – which prevented meltdown and the possible devastation of Japan’s entire eastern seaboard. The reactors also must be “vented” for pressure manually by workers agonisingly selected for the task. Played by Ken Watanabe as a man having the ultimate bad day at work, the simmering Yoshida looks in need of a similar intervention. Wakamatsu treats his account of these critical hours – the first direct depiction of the disaster, though Sion Sono’s Himizu (2011) was a poetic first responder – like a machine to be kept running at all costs. Often it consists of little more than technicians pelting into crisis rooms, adhering to the Akira school of screaming, with shocking gas-pressure read-outs. The civilian backstories are token, and though the film is critical of the brass, it doesn’t let this anger break into climactic outrage. Yoshida died in 2013 of unrelated oesophageal cancer: Watanabe’s big-shouldered presence makes this an ample tribute to the man, but the film could have been more than an easy clap for his workers. • Fukushima 50 is available from 8 March on digital formats.",Fukushima 50,FILM
Time's Up criticises HFPA over Golden Globes diversity plan,"A plan launched by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association to improve diversity in its membership and bolster the credibility of its Golden Globes awards has been met with scepticism by Time’s Up, one of the film industry’s leading activist organisations. The HFPA released a statement on social media on Sunday announcing “transformational change”, in the wake of stinging criticism before and during the 2021 edition of the Golden Globes a week ago. The organisation pledged to appoint an “expert in organisational diversity, equity and inclusion”, to add “Black and other underrepresented professionals to [the] organisation”, and to improve “transparency” over its voting and membership processes. However, Time’s Up responded immediately, accusing the HFPA of having dragged their feet “for decades”, and questioning the organisation’s commitment. In a statement on social media, Time’s Up said: “On behalf of the many artists who look to us to hold the HFPA’s feet to the fire on the racism, disrespect, misogyny, and alleged corrupt financial dealings of the Golden Globes, we need to see specific details, timetables for change, and firm commitments. The right words are not enough.” According to Deadline, Time’s Up has applied pressure on NBC, the source of the HFPA’s main revenue stream via lucrative payments for broadcasting the Golden Globes, to ensure significant changes take place.",Hollywood Foreign Press Association,OTHERS
The Humorist review – a comedian crumbles as the USSR collapses,"It’s 1984: the USSR is on the verge of collapse, and so is Boris Arkadiev (Aleksey Agranovich), a fictional standup who has enormous mainstream success but crumbles under bouts of insecurities. A failed novelist, Boris now tours the country with a banal routine about … a naughty monkey. The KGB approves and the audience roars with laughter, but Boris merely simmers with apathy. Boris’s problems lie in his political spinelessness. His friends chastise him: Simon (Semyon Steinberg), an outspoken writer, mourns Boris’ idealistic literary past; Max (Yuri Kolokolnikov), an actor enamoured with American culture, concludes that the comedian should defect. Adding to the horrors, Boris’ teenage son writes anti-communist rock tunes in a bedroom plastered with posters of David Bowie and T Rex. This failure to communicate reaches a surreal peak when Boris is summoned to perform his routine to a Russian astronaut in space. In one long restless take, Boris paces around a sparsely furnished bunker and breathlessly tells the same old jokes, only for the astronaut to tell him to stop. He has had enough. Boris has, too. This distinctive tendency to mix the weariness and the absurdities of life in the USSR makes The Humorist highly watchable. Agranovich’s performance is outstanding: his body language is subtle, but the actor has a magnetic way of sparking disillusionment or defiance in a simple look. Funnymen with a dark side can make for a great movie – think Lenny or Man on the Moon – but as a rule, the jokes must land; here they just aren’t funny enough. Even when Boris finally snaps and delivers scathingly uncensored jabs at Soviet officials in a bathhouse (another absurdist touch), it falls a bit flat. That’s a shame, as otherwise this is a intriguing time capsule of Soviet history. • The Humorist is released on 12 March on Your Screen.",The Humorist,FILM
A Colony review – kisses and cliches in tender coming-of-age debut,"This is a gorgeously gentle feature debut by the Canadian film-maker Geneviève Dulude-De Celles: a calm and tender portrait of a shy 12-year-old as she yo-yos between childhood and adolescence. It is beautifully acted and full of emotional complexity, although at times the storytelling seems a little derivative, with scenes half-familiar from indie’s back catalogue of coming-of-age movies. Emilie Bierre is lovely as Mylia, who is so painfully self-conscious that she hides in a toilet cubicle until the bell rings on her first day at a new school. Mylia lives in the sticks with her parents and younger sister Camille, a little scamp who sits at the breakfast table shoving cereal up her nose (played by newcomer Irlande Côté, who lights up the screen every time she appears). There’s a pang of sadness seeing the two girls together: Mylia leaving behind happy-go-lucky girlhood for what looks like a fragile anxious period of being a teenager. And the world is in a hurry to make her grow up, to sexualise her. One of the popular girls (Cassandra Gosselin-Pelletier), takes a shine to Mylia, inviting her to a party where there’s alcohol and a boy who likes her. (He’s got the shifty look of having just watched two hours of porn on his phone.) A much better option is Jimmy (Jacob Whiteduck-Lavoie), a soulful, long-haired kid in Mylia’s class; he is of Abenaki descent (though a subplot involving racism towards First Nations people at school feels a bit unthought-through). The script sensitively shows why her choices are a big deal. Which boy will be her first kiss? Should she party with the cool clique? Mylia is creating the blueprint for her identity as a teenager. It’s mostly an engrossing watch, but occasionally generic: these first experiences are pretty universal but feel a little reprocessed. Still, what an impressive debut. • A Colony is released on 15 March on Mubi.",A Colony,FILM
Los Conductos review – a cryptic Colombian parable,"This challenging Colombian parable feels like it could have been made in the 1970s, what with its cryptic storytelling, spiritual musings and vivid imagery, all shot on grainy 16mm. Rejecting conventional narrative structures, its story takes some decoding, and may well defy comprehension, but its striking visual language, with vibrant colours, sparse compositions and free-associative editing, casts quite a spell. Our protagonist is a bearded, long-haired young vagrant named Pinky (Luis Felipe Lozano), whom we first find shooting a man, stealing a motorbike, then getting high in an abandoned warehouse. It transpires he has recently left a cult and has killed its leader. We never see the cult in question, but in voiceover we learn of the hold its leader had on Pinky and other outcasts: “We had been miraculously saved from a world that had always seen us as worthless.” Fragments of Pinky’s experience are presented with little distinction between real and imagined. He spends time at a counterfeit T-shirt printing workshop. He recounts the tale of a beggar addict who believes they’re in a parallel world underground. He strips copper wire from buildings. He has a bewildering encounter with a man (who may be an incarnation of the cult leader) in a forest, where it is unclear who is going to kill whom. There are echoes here of Chilean auteur Alejandro Jodorowsky in the disorienting stew of metaphor and mysticism, and the sheer logic-defying strangeness of it all. Lozano even bears a physical resemblance to Jodorowsky in his head-trip classic The Holy Mountain. But director Camilo Restrepo seems less concerned with psychedelic spiritual questing than commenting on Colombia’s real social and political decay. The film ends with a poem by Gonzalo Arango (which could be a key to deciphering the entire exercise) that asks: “When will Colombia stop killing its sons?” Oblique and impenetrable as it is, it’s a memorable experience. • Los Conductos is available from 11 March on Mubi.",Los Conductos,FILM
My English Cousin review – searching doc about a man between two worlds,"Algerian-Swiss film-maker Karim Sayad has here created a sweetly indulgent portrait of his “English cousin” Fahed: a pudgy, smiley, good-natured guy sloping about the place in his England shirt, someone whom you can easily imagine as a little boy. Twenty years ago, Fahed came to the UK from Algeria illegally and started out sleeping rough. Now, with a frustrating and burdensome existence in Grimsby working two jobs in a factory and a kebab shop and estranged from his English partner, he has a yearning to return to Algeria to be close to his mother. He even claims that there is an Algerian woman back home who wants to be his fiancee. Sayad follows Fahed back to the old country, where the prodigal son finds a warm but tense situation. Fahed’s mum and his aunt are affectionate but exasperated at Fahed’s evasiveness on the subject of this woman to whom he’s supposed to have proposed: he doesn’t sound excited to be getting married and we never actually see his intended. Will Fahed settle back down in Algeria? It’s doubtful, for the simple reason that the people that he really seems to like – he lights up in their company – are his mates back in Grimsby, the lads that he shares a house with and goes to the pub with. This is an opaque film; for all the directness of Sayad’s film-making style, there is an awful lot Fahed is keeping back from us. He won’t really open up to his mum or his aunt, and Sayad himself isn’t going to break cover and ask questions. The film leaves it up to us to decide whether or not Fahed’s decisions are the right ones. • My English Cousin is released on 12 March on True Story.",My English Cousin,FILM
How to Stop a Recurring Dream review – Ruby Barker lends class to kidnap thriller,"There are some strong ideas and sharply observed family dysfunction drama in this feature debut by documentary maker Ed Morris. But none are enough to stop the film sinking into silliness, with a highly implausible abduction followed by a road trip across the South Downs. Bridgerton’s Ruby Barker plays troubled 19-year-old Yakira, who lives with her dad, his second wife and her lairy 12-year-old half-sister Kelly (Lily-Rose Aslandogdu). Family life is an emotional battlefield in their suburban semi, the two girls constantly at each other’s throats. Yakira resents the way their parents ignore Kelly’s nasty nickname for her: “No mum.” The whereabouts of her birth mother isn’t revealed until later on, but Barker’s compelling performance hints at a childhood trauma that has left Yakira feeling adrift in the world, vulnerable and impulsive. One night, after an explosive family row, Yakira kidnaps her sister while she sleeps. The logistics of this are the film’s first major plausibility lapse: is it actually possible to lift a 12-year-old out of bed, down some stairs and into a car without waking her up? Anyway, the plan is to take Kelly across the South Downs to visit Yakira’s mum. But when Kelly wakes up and flips, Yakira locks her in the boot. The police – called by their worried parents – launch a surprisingly well-resourced manhunt. Things go from bad to worse for Yakira when she accidentally picks up a hitchhiker (Andre Flynn). He looks like he’s walked out of a village hall production of Brideshead Revisited with a white suit, floppy hair and boarding-school sneer. Actually, he’s a drug dealer – and with his arrival the movie sinks into contrivance, increasingly forced and silly. Still, nothing can rub the shine off Barker’s huge talent; she is totally authentic even if the film is half-baked. • How to Stop a Recurring Dream is released on 9 March on digital platforms. • This article was amended on 12 March 2021.

'Snyder cut' of Justice League accidentally released on HBO Max,"The long-awaited “Snyder cut” of the superhero movie Justice League was accidentally released on streaming service HBO Max on Monday, before being removed. According to the Hollywood Reporter, customers who were attempting to access the new Tom and Jerry movie found that instead the service played Zack Snyder’s Justice League, which is due to be released on 19 March. One user reported on social media that more than an hour of the film (which has an official run time of 242 minutes) was screened. The new version was created after a fan campaign that began after the release of the original film in 2017, to unimpressed reviews. It starred Ben Affleck as Batman, Jason Momoa as Aquaman and Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, who team up to battle supervillain Steppenwolf. Snyder, the film’s credited director, left the project in May 2017 during postproduction, following the death of his daughter. Joss Whedon, who had co-written the film’s script and directed Marvel superhero films The Avengers and Avengers: Age of Ultron, took over the and reportedly set up extensive reshoots. After the film was removed from HBO Max, takedown notices were reportedly sent to social media users who had posted screenshots of the film.",Justice League,FILM
"Martyr review – masterful, visceral study of grief","Grief is a contradictory emotion: an intangible state of mind, while inducing overwhelming physical responses. Mazen Khaled’s masterly Martyr strikes the right balance as it simultaneously grounds the act of grieving in the real as well as the abstract. On a hot summer day in Beirut, Hassane (Hamza Mekdad) is restless. He lives with his parents who constantly nag him to get a job. Even his masturbation session in the shower is interrupted by his father grumbling about water waste. Dreaming of being submerged in the ocean, Hassane tries to find release at the seaside with his friends, equally aimless loafers who complain about stifling Beirut and their dire romantic prospects. Hassane, in a moment of bizarre clarity, climbs up above the rocky beach and takes a fatal dive. His body crashes into the water and suddenly, all that visible is sea-foam. Hassane doesn’t come up again. Like death, grief, too, is a kind of crash. Suddenly, Martyr erupts into freeze-frames. They capture Hassane’s body stretched out and gently carried by numerous pairs of arms and hands, as his friends bring him home. The moment death enters Hassane’s household, everyday life is irretrievably disrupted, and the film veers into experimentalism. At one point, Hassane’s mother (Carol Abboud) is seamlessly teleported to a black limbo where she and other female mourners grieve in the form of dance. In other hands, such stylistic choices might come off as gauche, but here they are cathartic; the mother’s devastating disbelief is violently exorcised. In Martyr, life and death are linked through such gestures. Moreover, while the sexual orientation of the men is unclear, there is a homoeroticism in their touch that nurtures Hassane from his adulthood to his sudden death. Grief can also be sensuous; that the same hands which have sunned with Hassane on the beach are now washing him for his final rites is pure cinematic poetry. • Martyr is released on 12 March on digital platforms.",Martyr,FILM
Sacrifice review – pagan fjords of misrule,"Writing-directing collaborators Andy Collier and Tor Mian’s follow-up to their well-received debut, cops-and-Satanists Charismata, constructs a classic fish-out-of-water premise by sending a wholesome average American guy, Isaac (Ludovic Hughes), and his heavily pregnant wife, Emma (Sophie Stevens), to a remote Norwegian island to claim a house Isaac has inherited. There, they find that the locals are pagans, that all dreams are bad and tentacled monsters lurk not just in the sea but also down the drain. So maybe that makes this a fish-in-the-water story. Or you could call it an invertebrate-in-the-water, if you want to be as pedantic as the Norwegian bartender who almost starts a fight with Isaac over the nature of calamari in one of the early scenes. Either way, the quirky script, adapted from a short story by Paul Kane and, as the opening credits assert, inspired by the work of HP Lovecraft, is quite good on the cultural friction between Americans and Europeans. It draws very deep from the well of uncanny associations that come with horror stories set in northern Europe such as The Wicker Man and Midsommar. Add this one to the mix and we almost have a mini-genre: you could call it Doggerland Gothic. Sacrifice’s contribution to the canon is notable, throwing in anxieties around a Nordic tendency towards madness brought on by long nights, northern lights, aquavit and too much skinny-dipping in icy waters. Collier and Mian have a lot of fun with nightmare fakeouts, casting doubt on what’s real and what’s a dream; together with the coloured gels used in the cinematography, this gives the whole thing a 1970s giallo vibe. Just to ice that cake of dried blood, the lovely Barbara Crampton, doyenne of classic horror films such as Re-Animator and From Beyond, is on hand as the local policewoman/high priestess, serving up menace with the pan-fried trout. • Sacrifice is released on 15 March on digital platforms.",Sacrifice,FILM
The Winter Lake review – a damp Irish mystery,"A strong setup is constrained by limited resources – financial and possibly creative –in this gloomy thriller set in damp rural Ireland. The story begins on a macabre note: gangly, troubled teenager Tom (Anson Boon) discovers a sack in a shallow lake containing the bones of a human baby. The lake is on the land of the rundown farmhouse he has just moved into with his mother, Elaine (Charlie Murphy), who looks young enough to be his sister. They clearly have their own baggage: Tom’s past behaviour is blamed for their relocation. The fresh start turns even sourer when they meet their nearest neighbours: grizzled farmer Ward (Michael McElhatton) and his teenage daughter Holly played by Emma Mackey, star of teen series Sex Education; she holds her own with the Irish accent, but this does little more for her CV. They, too, have their family baggage, it soon transpires. Tom’s mother is at first flirtatious with Ward, inviting him in for a whiskey at the first opportunity. Holly strikes up a parallel friendship with Tom, despite the fact he is withdrawn to the point of being almost mute. Her ulterior motives are not difficult to fathom after she spots the sack of bones in his possession. But then nobody is really being truthful in this claustrophobic situation, which allows in little in the way of trust or genuine affection. Things start off sombre and get darker, literally as well as tonally. The crisp cinematography and eerie score build up some tension, but with so few principal characters, the mystery of the baby is not difficult to solve, and a few too many plot contrivances lead to an anticlimactic resolution. There’s promise here but also perhaps some uncertainty: ultimately it falls between the stools of realist rural drama and full-on horror. • The Winter Lake is released on 15 March on digital platforms.",The Winter Lake,FILM
Verdict review - empathy and urgency in convincing domestic abuse drama,"Justice is not delayed but could still be denied in this arresting Filipino movie, which tracks a case of domestic abuse with such conviction, it is often easy to forget it’s staged drama rather than documentary. The first half-hour is especially frantic and immersive as it begins with the assault in question. Hard-up Manila mother Joy (Max Eigenmann) is preparing supper for her young daughter, Angel, in their cramped, cluttered little apartment. Her husband Dante (Kristoffer King) returns home drunk. A violent argument quickly erupts, in which Joy is brutally beaten and Dante slashed on the arm with a knife. As the police and women’s protection services intervene, we’re pitched almost in real time through the Manila night: down streets, through homes, into and out of vehicles, through police stations and to a clinic, swept along by agile, up-close, handheld camerawork. Adding to the trauma, Joy and Dante are dealt with practically side by side throughout. Calm mercifully prevails for a spell after Joy presses charges, although the demands of the Filipino justice system mean each side must gather their own witnesses and negotiate various circles of bureaucratic hell – still conducted through piles of paperwork. The eventual trial is gripping but infuriating: we’re in no doubt that childish, semi-criminal Dante is the guilty party, but his family enlists a smart lawyer who runs rings around the overstretched public prosecutor. There is an ironic twist to this particular case, but is clearly a drop in an ocean of domestic abuse that goes unreported or unpunished. The overall impression is of a legal system more concerned with expediency than justice: chaotic, rushed, patriarchal, under-resourced and open to abuse. Director Raymund Ribay Gutierrez, a protege of local auteur Brillante Mendoza, directs with empathy and energy here; he’s a name to watch. • Verdict is released on 12 March on digital platforms.",Verdict,FILM
Mouthpiece review – double the drama in doppelganger story,"Why have one actor play your lead character when you could have two? That’s the central conceit of this distinctive Canadian indie, written by the actors in question, Amy Nostbakken and Norah Sadava, and adapted from their stage play. They are both Cassandra, a disorganised woman in Toronto thrown into crisis by the death of her mother. Unlike movies with similar conceits – Luis Buñuel’s That Obscure Object of Desire, for example, where two actors alternated in a role – Mouthpiece keeps both women on screen at all times. As a reflection of a fractured mental state, it’s an effective device, although the relationship is not sharply defined. Sometimes they are like best friends or sisters, in playful internal dialogue; others they are in good cop/bad cop opposition, or even conflict. Sometimes their movements are identical (they trip over their scarves in synch, for example); at others they appear to be autonomous. The comic potential of the setup is largely sidestepped although a highlight is a scene where one Cassandra chimes in with distracting criticisms while her other self is trying to have sex with an old flame. As the Cassandras traverse snowy Toronto, making preparations for the funeral, flashbacks fill in a difficult mother-daughter relationship. Mother (Maev Beaty) was a smart, free-spirited, Joni Mitchell-loving divorcee, who has clearly transmitted her resentments and anxieties to her daughter. Female identity and its construction from within and without are to the fore, albeit from a certain perspective: as one Cassandra points out to the other: “You’re a white, thin, middle-class, educated, hetero Canadian.” It’s directed by Patricia Rozema, who is possibly best known for her 1999 risk-taking adaptation of Mansfield Park; it doesn’t quite escape its roots in experimental theatre. The story occasionally verges on self-indulgent (or rather, selves-indulgent), but it is playful and ingenious. • Mouthpiece is released on 12 March on digital platforms.",Mouthpiece,FILM
An Impossible Project review – life after digital in forward-looking retro doc,"Here is a documentary about the resurgent interest in retro culture that comes across like a warm fuzzy blanket of nostalgia for pre-Covid days. The central figure is “Doc” Florian Kaps, who the film presents as Vienna’s answer to Steve Jobs, a social visionary untroubled by such details as earning a living or indeed running a functioning business. Kaps’ speciality is what he calls “analogue”: physical hardware such as manual switchboards, jukeboxes, printing presses, and the like, made obsolete by the rise of laptops and smartphones. At the start of the film, Kaps’ attention is caught by the failing Polaroid camera, and – seemingly on a whim – he agrees to take over the company’s last factory, in the Netherlands. (We are not told much about his finances, other than the occasional arrival of tech investor types who pop up whenever needed.) It soon becomes clear that Kaps’ visionary utterances (“What does Facebook smell like?”) are no match for a solid business plan, and after a few years of trying fruitlessly to replicate Polaroid’s instant film, Kaps is ejected from his own company when a former intern becomes CEO after bringing in his own investor father. Kaps is not daunted after this cautionary experience, and applies his roving mind to, first, a cafe/gallery called Supersense, and later to hotel keeping; his tech contacts come in handy for the latter as he appears to get backing from Facebook’s Analog Research Lab to restart operations at a giant mothballed Overlook-type place called Sudbahnhotel. It’s never clear exactly what roles Kaps has in any of these activities, or how he earns money, but he is genial company and makes a persuasive case for life beyond the digital realm: making an astute observation that, where once analogue businesses tried to convert to digital, digital companies are now getting interested in the real world. Of course, this was all filmed pre-Covid, during which the power of digital technology has asserted itself like never before. It’s possible that Kaps’ enthusiasms may have foundered by the time the pandemic recedes. • An Impossible Project is released on 15 March on digital platforms.",An Impossible Project,FILM
The Columnist review – middle class writer on a murder spree,"To paraphrase Nietzsche: gaze too long into Twitter, and Twitter will gaze into you. Anyone who writes for a living on the internet has surely fantasised about payback time for all the keyboard warriors, callous below-the-liners and unrepentant trolls out there. Ivo van Aart’s movie gives full rein to that desire and is snappily directed – but in the end there is something self-satisfied and sententious about his feminist revenge flick. Katja Herbers plays Femke Boot, a newspaper columnist drowning in internet misogyny, especially after she steps out of her usual lifestyle remit to write an op-ed about Zwarte Piet, the Dutch blackface folkloric character. Her book publisher is pressurising her for juicier material to better compete with author-of-the-hour Steven Dood (Steven Death), a kohl-rimmed provocateur who savages her on a chatshow. Umbilically fed by her phone on a diet of shitposter abuse, she finally snaps when she realises her neighbour – partial to some Zwarte Piet himself – is one of her tormentors. As her serial-mom killing spree gets under way, Van Aart drapes a couple of complementary plotlines around it: her daughter Anna (Claire Porro) is fired from the school newspaper and, via the medium of F-bomb-loaded banners, fights a battle for free speech. And when Femke ends up in bed with Dood, it turns out his gothic bad boy persona is just a pose, and he is actually keeper material. These aspects hover soberly around the themes of free expression and online identities – but dilute the black comedy Van Aart attempts to operate with elsewhere. There is some nice absurdist carnage, such as middle-class mum Femke creeping along a gutter to tip a neighbour off the roof in her inaugural murder. But the humour isn’t sharpened to a fine point, leaving each new death to bludgeon in The Columnist’s thesis with the blunt end: online life has robbed us of the ability to appreciate nuance and difference. Femke’s graduation to monster lacks the delicious irony it’s shooting for, as a few plot-logic slips en route – why leave uncleaned weapons around for others to discover? – betray Van Aart’s haste to get his opinion out there. • The Columnist is released on 12 March on digital platforms.",The Columnist,FILM
