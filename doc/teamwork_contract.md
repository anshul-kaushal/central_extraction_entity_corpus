**Work Distribution**
We aim to distribute work equally among all members. To improve efficiency, we would assign tasks to members according to their preference and expertise. Each member is expected to spend an average of 6 to 7 hours each week on the project. The group meetings will be on Zoom and held once or twice per week and each meeting should last around 1 to 1.5 hours. We will list the agenda before a meeting and record each person's contributions and tasks in the following days. We plan to do most of the work remotely and meet on campus to fix bugs or clarify certain designs if needed. We will not use daily "stand-ups" as contributions are covered in meeting summaries.

**Member Expectation**
We expect to produce clear documentation and structured code for all parts of the project. APIs should meet the REST constraints and Python code should be formatted with PEP 8 style. We should always optimize performance if possible. When a team member is not available due to scheduling confilicts or emergencies, others can help with his or her unfinished work. We would not slect a project manager since the team is small enough that direct communication should resolve all potential conflicts. The person who is responsible for each week's submission should notify other members once the final submission is made.
