Bloody Nose, Empty Pockets review – bittersweet bar-room endgame	It’s the “last day in paradise” for Las Vegas dive bar the Roaring ’20s, which will shut permanently after the evening’s festivities. Over the next 18 hours, as the booze begins to flow, there are several slurred flirtations and a fight. Inevitably, at least one person takes their top off. The film is directed by Bill and Turner Ross (known for their documentaries 45365 and Tchoupitoulas), and shot fly-on-the-wall style. But elements of this riotous hybrid documentary are staged. The Roaring ’20s is actually in New Orleans, not Vegas, with characters street-cast, and playing fictionalised versions of themselves. Yet the sense of the watering hole as a haven for lost souls – not to mention the threat of gentrification to civic space – couldn’t be more vérité. Inside the bar, red fairylights give a rose-tinted glow. The film’s mood is bittersweet, never more so than in a scene that shows the revellers trailing into the car park to set off fireworks, depicted via grainy security camera footage. Sophie B Hawkins’s 1992 track Damn, I Wish I Was Your Lover (a pop song about bearing witness to an abusive relationship) plays softly from the jukebox inside. Martin, a regular, hovers by the bar, watching Hollywood western The Misfits. Like Eli Wallach’s Guido, whose voice can be heard on the TV, he’s “just looking for a place to hide and watch it all go by”.
Sylvie's Love review – Tessa Thompson captivates in jazz-hot romance	Sylvie (Tessa Thompson) has been taught by her mother to stand tall, shoulders back and chin lifted, like a proper lady. Unobserved, she’s considerably looser, freer, grooving to Bill Haley’s See You Later, Alligator in the back of her father’s record store. It’s this uninhibited joy that catches the eye of struggling jazz saxophonist Robert (NFL player turned actor Nnamdi Asomugha) in Eugene Ashe’s glossy period romance. Set in Harlem between 1957 and 1962, the lusty spark between the pair combusts despite Sylvie’s engagement to the more respectable Lacy (Alano Miller). An unexpected pregnancy and a career-making gig in Paris are further obstacles. Thompson and Asomugha have great chemistry, but the film stalls a little in the second half, when the focus pivots towards the couple’s careers. Like Barry Jenkins’s If Beale Street Could Talk and Todd Haynes’s Carol, Ashe takes the form of the 50s melodrama and recentres it on characters the genre has tended to ignore. This isn’t as politically restless as those films – it’s less interested in subverting the “woman’s picture” than establishing itself as one. In the same way that Saul Leiter’s photographs of New York were a visual reference point for Carol, cinematographer Declan Quinn draws inspiration from Gordon Parks’s photo essays for Life magazine. The period costuming is also a dream, with Thompson as striking as any Golden Age heroine in a teal Chanel gown and white elbow-length gloves. Sylvie’s Love is on Amazon Prime
Deliver Us From Evil review – frenzied hit-man thriller is full of cinematic life	There’s a throb of menace driving this gonzo action-thriller from South Korean director Hong Won-chan, who wrote the screenplays for The Yellow Sea and The Chaser. This was a big box-office hit on its home turf. Hwang Jung-min is In-nam, a former cop turned paid assassin who has just whacked a yakuza in Tokyo, and now this dead man’s fanatically violent blood-brother Ray (Lee Jung-jae) is out for revenge. To add to this, In-nam hears that his former girlfriend has been killed in Bangkok, following a bungled attempt to make contact with the kidnappers of her nine-year-old daughter – and the child is still alive, in the abductors’ hands. So In-nam journeys to Thailand on a desperate redemptive mission to save this little girl, with the scary and blood-thirsty Ray on his trail, and the only person in Bangkok who can help him is Yui (Park Jung-min); Yui is a transgender woman who, for all that she is no mobster, manages at one stage to ram a van with her pickup truck, saving In-nam’s life. The twin storylines should undermine the film’s pace and focus. They don’t. There are some impressively spectacular shootouts in the streets and a Bourne-level rooftop chase, together with some very crunchy close-quarters martial arts. Hwang, his face almost always covered in beads of sweat, is a very persuasive and impassive action hero and Lee is creepy and uproariously over the top. Could he be a Bond villain in the years to come? The 007 franchise could certainly do a lot worse. Released on digital formats on 4 January.
The Call review – a phoned-in mix of ghouls, ghosts and well-worn tropes	This telephonically themed horror film, set in nameless American suburbia circa 1987, is not to be confused with the Korean horror film of the same name that also came out this year (and relies crucially on a landline call). This confection is a fairly shonky assemblage of tired tropes, full of dropped connections and annoying static. Its biggest virtue is that it contains another gamey, and game-for-anything, performance from horror-film matriarch Lin Shaye. Shaye has played spooky ladies in scads of scary films, such as the Insidious franchise and lesser known fare such as the enticingly titled Helen Keller vs Nightwolves. Here she is Edith Cranston, a former schoolteacher who has been a raving mess since being blamed for the death of one of her pupils (although never convicted of the murder). Nevertheless, a gaggle of teenagers, including Tonya (Erin Sanders), older sister of the murdered child, has persisted in taunting, teasing, playing pranks and bullying Edith for years. When Tonya and new kid in town Chris (Chester Rushing), along with brothers Brett (Sloane Morgan Siegel) and Zack (Mike Manning), finally push Cranston too far, she kills herself. But her husband Edward (Tobin Bell) summons the high-school seniors back to the house with a strange proposition: if they make a phone call on a decrepit old princess phone, ostensibly to a handset installed in Edith’s grave, and stay on the line for just one minute, they’ll each earn a substantial inheritance. Being teens in an American horror film, the kids are too stupid and greedy to twig this is a terrible idea. Traumatic flashbacks, mangled corpses with gymnastic abilities and blood-splattered undead apparitions soon ensue. One might posit a subtextual interpretation that the youth of today, reared on mobiles, are so unaccustomed to landlines that they see these once ubiquitous household fixtures simply as conveyances for transmitting evil. Released on 11 January on digital formats.
This Is Not a Burial, It’s a Resurrection review – an uncompromising tale of resistance	This is an extraordinary and otherworldly feature film from the tiny landlocked kingdom of Lesotho in southern Africa. It is the tale of a rebel spirit: an elderly woman who opposes government plans to flood her village, making way for a dam. It’s a film about resistance and resilience, but director Lemohang Jeremiah Mosese is coolly unsentimental and realistic about the inevitable march of capitalism and construction. Weaving in ideas around displacement, collective identity and history, this film takes on almost mythic qualities. Some of the actors are non-professionals, but the central role is performed by Mary Twala, who appeared in Idris Elba’s Nelson Mandela biopic Long Walk to Freedom. She plays Mantoa, an 80-year-old widow whose son – her last remaining relative – is killed in a mining accident in neighbouring South Africa. (The film isn’t about poverty, but it’s present in every frame.) Feeling ready to die, Mantoa is making arrangements to be buried in the village graveyard when she hears of the dam project; villagers are to be forcibly resettled in the city. Mantoa decides to put stop to it. She has nothing left to live for, and in a sense this gives her real power. She doesn’t care about offending the pastor, or if people think she’s a witch; she is bent on being buried with her family. This is a severe, uncompromising film; it’s more like a series of images strung together, each framed exactingly, like a painting. At the centre of it all is Twala, often silent, her expression fixed in determination – no words needed. Mosese has said that to avoid cliche he wrote the character as a man then switched the name to female. And Twala gives a tremendous performance, intimate yet epic. This Is Not a Burial is the first film from Lesotho to be entered into the Oscars race for best international feature. Sadly, Twala did not live to share in the success; she died in July last year. • This Is Not a Burial, It’s a Resurrection is on Mubi from 13 January.
Ham on Rye review – subversive satire on suburban conformity	First-time feature director Tyler Taormina has dreamed his way into a very strange and intriguing film: a Gen-Z reverie about life and fate, somewhere between The Prom and The Purge. The film never behaves as if it is anything other than a realist coming-of-age drama but there is something else going on. Haley (Haley Bodell) is part of a clique of popular high-school kids in a bland suburban town who are preparing to take part in a local tradition. She and some other girls are wearing floaty dresses of sacrificial white and getting ready to go down to a local deli called Monty’s – along with a whole crowd of other kids – for what seems to be a pairing-off ritual, like a dance without music or dancing. But there is a lot riding on this, and Haley can’t persuade herself that she wants to join in. Ham on Rye is a satirical parable on conformism and aspiration, and it speaks to anyone who, in settled adulthood, looks back to when their life and romantic chances were arbitrarily decided by a few events in their teens and early 20s. And there’s another layer, too. Ham on Rye takes a bleakly subversive look at the whole idea of breaking free of your boring suburban home town and making it in the glamorous adult world beyond. This is the theme of so many films, and perhaps it is the overriding theme of Hollywood itself. So many films succumb to the romantic fantasy that the way to do this is to be a rebel, a free-thinker, a defier-of-norms. Yet this film, in its surreal way, is grimly about something closer to the un-surreal truth: the people who got out of their boring, philistine home towns were overwhelmingly the competent conformists, at least outwardly and temporarily. They were the ones who worked hard, got good grades and went far away to college, where their individuality could at last flourish. Taormina’s meditation on all this could be compared to Yorgos Lanthimos or Gus Van Sant, but it is very individual work, as creepy as a ghost story. • Ham on Rye is available on Mubi from 11 January.
Vanguard review – Jackie Chan reunites with Stanley Tong for patriotic action comedy	Veteran Hong Kong action director Stanley Tong reunites with his longtime star Jackie Chan for this amiable but rather under-par adventure with silly CGI effects. Chan is allowed one or two comedy moments, but takes a very straight and stately role as Tang, the “elder statesman”-type director of an elite private security firm called Vanguard, presiding over tough, battle-ready and apparently also catwalk-ready young people – and occasionally pulling a few martial arts moves. In his trim three-piece suit and glasses, however, he looks faintly like Ronnie Corbett. A Chinese accountant and his young wife are kidnapped in London’s Chinatown and Vanguard (with its preposterous HQ full of people wearing phone headsets and gazing at computer screens) is tasked with rescuing him, his wife and his winsome daughter, who is doing laudable conservation work in a nation state referred to initially as “Africa”. She is also vulnerable to abduction as she frolics with CGI big cats in Lion King world. Tang and his crew toughly resolve to rescue their man, while frowning at his supposedly unwitting links with arms dealers, the source of all his woes. Their adventure takes them all over the world, from London (where Chinatown and Buckingham Palace are apparently adjacent) to a fictional land that looks vaguely like Zambia and then to the ineffably boring but wealthy world of Dubai. The scene with a jetski on the edge of a waterfall deserves points, but this feels disposable: the Chinese New Year is earnestly referenced as part of the film’s strident and faintly humourless patriotism. • Vanguard is in cinemas and on digital formats from 8 January.
Vanguard review – an outrageous waste of Jackie Chan	There’s an argument to be made that a film featuring a jet-ski machete fight on the edge of a waterfall, robotic surveillance wasps, solid gold supercars, weaponised attack hyenas and Jackie Chan doesn’t actually need to be good, in the conventional sense of the word. And with its multiple locations (London, Beijing, Dubai, Zambia, India) and efficiently packaged moments of nationalistic fervour, this action picture, which pits Chinese covert security organisation Vanguard against the scenery-mangling forces of evil, is clearly aiming for the pulpy escapist end of the market. But even so, there’s precious little fun to be had in this self-important mess of a movie. Chan plays the head of Vanguard, but spends an awful lot of time in the field with his elite agents. Their mission: to rescue a businessman and his eco-YouTuber daughter Fareeda (Ruohan Xu) from villains who see them as the route to a missing fortune and, ultimately, some kind of genocidal ultra-weapon. The score feels like being trepanned by music; the story, like the VFX action sequences, is illogical and hacked together. It’s an unforgivable waste of Jackie Chan, action-movie legend, reduced here to pratfalls and gurning double takes. Vanguard is available on multiple VOD platforms
Robin's Wish review – how a comedy giant was destroyed by dementia	The genius of Robin Williams is taken as a given by this intensely sad documentary, which pays fleeting tribute to the actor and comedian’s talent but focuses mainly on the undiagnosed neurodegenerative disease that led him to take his own life in 2014. Lewy body dementia is a deadly and devastating condition, one that is little known and frequently misdiagnosed. And for someone like Williams, whose brilliance depended on the quickfire, sparking neural connections of his exceptional brain, the symptoms, which include fear, delusions and hallucinations, must have been particularly terrifying. This film, made at the behest of Williams’s widow, Susan Schneider, is intended to raise awareness of the condition. It’s certainly informative and affecting, but the limited use of early archive footage and the emphasis on Williams’s decline and suffering make for bleak viewing. • On multiple VOD platforms
Mayor review – an inspiring portrait of a Palestinian city official	Local governance, according to Musa Hadid, mayor of the Palestinian city of Ramallah, is the most beautiful branch of politics. It’s certainly, as this compelling fly-on-the-wall documentary attests, the area in which he is able to have the most direct connection with the city and its people. The very likable Mayor Hadid is a robustly hands-on public servant – we watch him pondering city branding and overseeing the abseiling Santas at the Christmas tree lighting. We also see him dealing with a sewage spill, berating a bus driver for speeding and, in some of the film’s most dramatic moments, witnessing Israeli forces shooting at protesters, and finding himself temporarily besieged in the city hall. Deft editing and unexpectedly affecting music choices make for an engaging portrait of the kind of impassioned and dedicated politician who seems in short supply right now. • Mayor is available on Curzon Home Cinema, Dogwoof and iTunes
The Intergalactic Adventures of Max Cloud review – video game send-up is virtually pointless	Here is a throwaway space spoof, an affectionate send-up of the naffness of early 90s video games, that lovingly recreates the vintage details with its production design and fight choreography, but is troublingly low on scripted gags. It plays out in two dimensions: virtual and real life. Inside a computer game, explorer Max Cloud is an intergalactic hero, a preposterous macho knucklehead in latex, sturdily performed by actor and martial arts expert Scott Adkins, who has appeared in a few of the Marvels. I did wonder if an actor with the comic chops for some megaton silliness might have done some heavier lifting here. Meanwhile, in actual Brooklyn, teenage gamer Sarah (Isabelle Allen) is hooked on the Max Cloud video game. After a fight with her dad she is mysteriously teleported into the game – and into the body of a minor character, chef Jake (Elliot James Langridge). You might consider this a waste of a female lead – putting her into the body of a male actor – but there she stays for most of the movie. For any chance of making it back to her real life she must complete the game with the help of her friend playing in her bedroom (Franz Drameh). John Hannah is painfully unfunny as ultra baddie Revengor, who wants to destroy planet Earth over a past snub. This is a film so inoffensive that for the first 10 minutes I thought it was targeted at kids, until one of the characters dropped a swear (and thinking about it, anyone under 40 will be oblivious to its reference). But in lampooning naffness without enough laughs, it veers perilously close to actually being naff. A reminder that clever comedians are required to pull off daft comedy. • Released on 18 January on digital formats.
The New Music review – Parkinson's meets punk in a feelgood fable	There are some moments of genuine feeling in this uneven Dublin-set indie about a classical pianist who joins the punk scene after being diagnosed with early-onset Parkinson’s. I wasn’t entirely sold on all the performances and there is a fair amount of predictability in the storytelling. But it’s a film made with warmth and sincerity, and the energy of the soundtrack by local bands helps along the awkward bits. Cilléin McEvoy is pianist Adrian, a former child prodigy on the brink of classical stardom. He reacts with fury and denial to his Parkinson’s diagnosis, disappearing off to Dublin where he rents the fourth room in a shared house. His flatmates are three carefree students in a punk band – two men and female drummer – who don’t spot his telltale tremors. Adrian has known nothing but music and discipline since childhood, and, dressed in his expensive suit and shiny leather loafers, he is the antithesis of punk. But inevitably his sniffiness about the band’s primitive songs gives way to appreciation. There is something in McEvoy’s buttoned-down, accountant-stiff performance that is somehow unconvincing – or perhaps the character is too thinly written. Certainly, he’s eclipsed by Martina Babisova, who gives a lovely natural performance as cool drummer Jodie. When he behaves like a total prat after they sleep together, she calls him out in a way that is disarmingly open and honest; their relationship gives the film its beating heart. Director Chiara Viale is Italian and her camera chases about the Dublin streets looking for fun and good times – it made me desperate to get on a plane and go somewhere, to see something new. The film is a little patchy, but its feelgood mood is hard to resist. • The New Music is available from 18 January on digital platforms.
The Doorman review – Ruby Rose turns model action hero	Model-turned-actor Ruby Rose (Orange Is the New Black, John Wick: Chapter 2), is utterly mesmerising to look at – with her lush lips, perfectly shaped eyebrows and macho tattoos – but so far the jury is very much out on whether she can act more than merely adequately. This action vehicle doesn’t exactly strengthen the case for her defence, although she moves with impressive grace in the actiony bits when required in closeups that show her character, Ali, whupping bad guys’ asses. Rose is meant to be a former marine, haunted by a botched assignment that cost the lives of a family she was protecting. In the film’s present tense, she takes a job as a doorman – shouldn’t it be “lobby attendant” or even “doorperson”? – at a posh New York City building, only to wander accidentally into a heist that goes very wrong. A strangely immobile-featured Jean Reno offers an almost self-parodying turn as the snobbish yet brutal French mastermind of the criminal gang, who are looking for paintings looted by the Nazis years back. Ali must protect the husband (Rupert Evans), teenage son (Julian Feder) and irritatingly spunky daughter (Kíla Lord Cassidy) from harm – which involves a lot of skulking in the building’s secret passageways, making for a mostly one-set shoot that looks like it saved a lot on budget. Director Ryuhei Kitamura, whose career began with pulpy horror fare, directs with efficiency but a seeming total lack of awareness of how silly this all looks from a distance. There’s little humour or invention to leaven the deadened inertness of the script. • The Doorman is available from 18 January on digital platforms.
Daniel review – terrifying tale of an Isis captive	Over the last couple of decades, Danish cinema has increasingly proved to have a strong aptitude for emotive, nuanced drama and intelligent engagement, particularly through documentary-making, with conflicts abroad. This inspired-by-a-true-story feature, from journeyman director Niels Arden Oplev (who helmed the original Girl With the Dragon Tattoo film) skilfully combines those two strands to tell the story of Daniel Rye, a young Danish photographer who was captured by Isis in Syria in 2013. Filmed in a wiggly, handheld fashion – such a signature of the Dogma 95 years it almost feels like a retro affectation – the plot tracks methodically through Daniel’s story, holding tight on the expressive face of Esben Smed, who rises to the physical challenges of the role. For starters, he has to convincingly pass as Rye when he was young enough to be a contender for the Danish gymnastics team, although presumably a stuntman performed most of the acrobatics we see. In the film, after an injury ruins Rye’s sports career, a shift into photojournalism takes him to Syria where he falls into the hands of Isis, which was barely known at that time. They demand a multimillion-dollar ransom, but the Danish government sticks to its policy of not negotiating with terrorists. The film toggles smoothly back and forth between Rye’s family back home, scrabbling to raise the money without letting the story get into the press, and Rye himself in Syria. Oplev doesn’t shy away from the depiction of torture and suffering experienced by Rye and his fellow prisoners, one of whom was James Foley, an American journalist whose plight became an international story. Anyone who followed the news at the time will know the tragedies that lay ahead, but the point here isn’t what happened but it why. There’s empathy for all those scarred by this conflict, even in a strange way for John (Amir El-Masry), the British-accented Isis jailer who makes Rye’s life hell but is revealed in closeup to be consumed with his own kind of psychic pain. This is another film about a white European mixed up in a Middle Eastern war they barely seem to understand, but on its own terms it’s a story well told. • Daniel is available from 18 January on digital formats.
'The most honest person I ever met': Chadwick Boseman's widow pays tribute at Gotham film awards	The first significant awards event of the current film cycle spread its net wide, but the main attention of the 2021 Gotham awards, designed to reward independent film-makers, was focused on a tearful speech given by Simone Ledward as she accepted an award on behalf of her late husband Chadwick Boseman. Boseman had been announced as a recipient of the Gothams’ annual tribute award, along with Viola Davis, Steve McQueen and Ryan Murphy. Ledward, whose marriage to Boseman was made public only after the actor’s death, said in her speech: “He was the most honest person I ever met … He was blessed to live many lives within his concentrated one. He harnessed the power of letting go and letting God’s love shine through. May we not let his conviction be in vain. It is my honour on behalf of my husband.” She added: “Chad … thank you. I love you. I am so proud of you. Keep shining your light on us.” Boseman was also nominated for best actor for his performance in Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, a biopic of the celebrated blues singer played by Davis. However, in the event the award went to Riz Ahmed for his role as a drummer with hearing problems in Sound of Metal, catapulting Ahmed into the wider awards race. There was another surprise win in the best actress category, with Nicole Beharie winning for her performance as a former pageant winner in Miss Juneteeth, defeating strong favourite Frances McDormand who had been nominated for festival hit Nomadland. However, Nomadland, the widely admired study of retiree victims of the 2008 financial crash directed by Chloé Zhao, did take two prizes – best feature and the audience award – making it the only film to claim more than one win on the night, cementing its status as an Oscar frontrunner. Michaela Coel’s I May Destroy You continued its remarkable run by picking up the breakthrough series – short format award. Full list of awards Best feature Nomadland Best documentary A Thousand Cuts Best international feature Identifying Features Breakthrough director award Andrew Patterson, The Vast of Night Best screenplay The Forty-Year-Old Version and Fourteen (joint winners) Best actor Riz Ahmed, Sound of Metal Best actress Nicole Beharie, Miss Juneteenth Breakthrough actor Kingsley Ben-Adir, One Night in Miami Breakthrough series – long format Watchmen Breakthrough Series – short format I May Destroy You Audience award Nomadland
Hunted review – Red Riding Hood reboot is a nifty, nasty trip into the woods	Cinematic rethinks of classic fairytales, especially Red Riding Hood, are a micro-genre about as exasperating and banal as the “year X called and it wants its Y back” joke. In Hunted’s case insert, 1985 for X and “postmodern feminist trope” for Y. Nevertheless, this uncomfortable but adroitly executed horror version in which a young woman is chased through the woods by toxic male monsters is pretty good stuff: unnerving in the right ways and flecked with colourful, unexpected specks of wit. In what presumably must be rural Ireland given most of the supporting characters’ accents, Eve (Lucie Debay, feral and fierce) is a bit of an outsider, a French woman stuck in the middle of nowhere supervising the construction of a housing estate. A chance visit to a local bar brings her into the orbit of a charming, vulpine-featured nameless stranger who sounds American but is actually played by the French actor Arieh Worthalter. After he saves her from the aggressive attentions of another guy (Ciaran O’Brien), Eve lets down her guard only to find herself kidnapped by a psychotic, sadistic misogynist. Even worse, he’s a psychotic sadistic misogynist with a movie camera, and we all know how evil they are. From there on out, the rest of film is the narrative slap and tickle of escape-recapture as Eve, dressed in red duffel coat, tries to get away. She is in an ancient, soggy forest where there are a few other characters wandering around, ready to fill the roles of grandma and woodsman. But director Vincent Paronnaud, working from a script he co-wrote with Léa Pernollet and David H Pickering, adds a few kinks that divert the story from the tracks laid down by the fairytale origins. Thankfully, we only see glimpses of the footage of tortured women on the hideously believable nemesis’s camera, so ultimately the movie – just about – feels more like a critique of the character’s woman-hating mindset rather than a vehicle for it. Released on 14 January on Shudder.
Recon review – GIs on a mission to nowhere	The Tenet-style action “rewind” in Recon’s opening scene suggests this adaptation of Richard Bausch’s 2008 novel Peace, based on his grandfather’s wartime experiences, might offer more than the average second world war thriller. Don’t get your hopes up. There’s no time travel, nor multi-perspective narrative tricks, nor even an innovative depiction of trauma’s impact on memory. Recon takes place in just the single dimension of reality, and a rather leaden one at that. Alexander Ludwig (Vikings) stars as Marson, a US army corporal stationed somewhere in Italy, who is sent trudging into the mountains by a callous commanding officer on a pointless and potentially suicidal reconnaissance mission. He and his small crew are irritable, exhausted and haunted by a recently witnessed war crime, all of which they articulate at length as they struggle through the snow. Their guide is an elderly farmer (Franco Nero, AKA Mr Vanessa Redgrave; furnishing the film with some Italian suavity) who was unfortunate enough to have crossed their path. He may or may not be a secret Nazi sympathiser leading them into a trap, and his habit of mumbling, “I had a family … tutti morti,” doesn’t do much to allay suspicions. The soldiers’ chit-chat has some Catch-22-esque wit to it – especially when delivered by Marson’s Brooklyn-accented brother-in-arms Asch (a standout Chris Brochu). But there’s altogether too much of it. In a real combat situation, surely arguing this loudly about Hershey bars and baseball odds would have drawn the unwelcome attention of enemy forces, with deadly consequences. The fact that it doesn’t here saps any potential dramatic tension from the situation, notwithstanding all the unseen snipers and landmines they encounter. Bausch’s book has been praised for its existential profundity on religious matters, but very little of that makes it to the screen. • Recon is on digital platforms from 18 January.
Blithe Spirit review – Judi Dench presides over a deathly farce	The classic Noël Coward comedy about a ghost (first filmed by David Lean in 1945 with Rex Harrison) has now been adapted again, with stage and TV director Edward Hall making his movie debut. It can only be described as an un-reinvention, a tired, dated and unfunny period piece that changes the original plot a bit but offers no new perspective, and no new reason to be doing it in the first place. (Not compared with, say, Matthew Warchus’s stage revival of Coward’s Present Laughter at the Old Vic, with Andrew Scott radically reinventing the leading role.) This film looks unironically like the tatty old musical revue show that Ken Russell imagined for his “meta” adaptation of The Boy Friend. Dan Stevens plays crime writer Charles Condomine, who has been creatively blocked since the death of his first wife Elvira (Leslie Mann) seven years before, and now tensely remarried to the more uptight Ruth (Isla Fisher). He has the idea of putting a spiritualist into the new movie screenplay he’s working on, and invites a notorious stage medium, Madame Arcati (Judi Dench), to his house to perform a seance, so that he can do some research into the wiles of these confidence tricksters. But, to his astonishment (and Madame Arcati’s), the seance brings back the ghost of Elvira, who wreaks havoc. Despite the heavyweight cast, the film’s production values are those of a kids’ TV show that might go out on a weekday afternoon. Dench does her best with the role of Madame Arcati, and she even has a notably surreal moment, carrying out an occult ceremony in a beachside cave. But the rest is a festival of mugging and farcical overacting, and the Cowardian style seems brittle without any snap. • Blithe Spirit is on Sky Cinema from 15 January.
Imperial Blue review – Ugandan adventures of a drug-smuggling dope	Drug smuggler Hugo (Nicolas Fagerberg) has “the connect”. Or he’d like to think he does. Certainly this debut feature from British director Dan Moss knows several good spots, guiding us through a series of impressive locations with the confidence of a seasoned traveller. After Hugo’s big-money hashish deal in a partly flooded Mumbai building site goes wrong, he’s introduced to Bulu, a blue-powdered hallucinogen with mystical properties. “They say it makes you see the future,” says his go-between (Ashish Verma). Could this mysterious substance make Hugo enough money to satisfy his UK-based bosses? He’ll have to track down a supply source first. Everything about the London drug world that Hugo then stops off in – from the 80s punk get-ups of the big players to the readiness with which these supposedly shrewd operators approve Hugo’s wild goose chase – is risibly unrealistic. But he’s soon en route to “Fort Lugard, Uganda”, where the plot is on safer ground. The wise decision to employ locals where possible tells in the compelling specificity of the Ugandan settings and characters. Esther Tebandeke and Rehema Nanfuka are both excellent as, respectively, Kisakye, a village woman with access to the blue stuff and a healthy suspicion of Hugo, and Angela, Kisakye’s more worldly, scheming sister. Hugo is also a very believable example of the kind of straggly bearded adventure-seeker who’s convinced he’s blending in with the locals. Too believable, almost. These guys get tiresome after a 10-minute chat at the backpacker hostel bar, so why construct a whole film around his story? Especially with an abundance of more intriguing characters relegated to the margins. Imperial Blue aims at a knowing satire of colonial arrogance, yet still, somehow, it’s all about the white guy. Eurocentrism is one helluva drug. • Imperial Blue is available from 18 January on digital platforms.
Stardust review – David Bowie biopic is an odd-couple oddity	The very talented actor and musician Johnny Flynn here makes a perfectly game attempt to impersonate the young David Bowie in this ironised and fictionalised account of Bowie’s 1971 US publicity tour which – partly – inspired his Ziggy Stardust persona. Flynn carries off Bowie’s clothes and delicate mannerisms plausibly enough and, impressively, he does his own singing. But, all too often, this Bowie looks as if he is presenting TV’s Bake Off. Bowie arrived at Washington DC’s Dulles airport where an immigration official called him a “fag”, and where Mercury Records publicity man Ron Oberman (played here by comic Marc Maron) arrived to meet him, having got a lift to the airport from his mum and dad, and took the bemused Bowie back for a home-cooked family meal, like a 13-year-old foreign exchange student. The movie shows this, but where in reality the tour saw Bowie fly to major cities, meeting with Oberman a few times and doing interviews, the movie escalates this to a huge comedy-odd-couple road trip. Oberman and Bowie head across the country in Ron’s uncool, un-rock’n’roll station wagon, with Bowie playing disastrous, low-key gigs and Ron becoming a Spinal Tap-type PR goof who is mortified at the poor turnout. Meanwhile, back in London, Jena Malone plays the heavily pregnant Angie Bowie, who comes across as a charmlessly shrill and bad-tempered scold, and David is having traumatised flashback memories of his troubled brother Terry (Derek Moran). The movie makes a laboured connection between Terry’s mental illness and David’s dark imaginings, a connection that surely comes close to misunderstanding the nature of schizophrenia. And so the tour goes on, and Bowie providentially hears (or hears about) the music of Iggy Pop and cult psychobilly star Legendary Stardust Cowboy, which fed into the Ziggy Stardust creation. This is a strained, frustrating concoction that doesn’t do its subject justice. Flynn really can sing, though. • Stardust is available from 15 January on digital platforms.
Macaulay Culkin joins calls to get Donald Trump cameo removed from Home Alone 2	Home Alone star Macaulay Culkin has endorsed social media comments demanding Donald Trump’s cameo in the film’s sequel be digitally removed and replaced with one of an older version of Culkin himself. Culkin replied to a tweet that asked “petition to digitally replace trump in ‘home alone 2’ with 40-year-old macaulay culkin” with the single word: “Sold.” Culkin then followed up by responding “Bravo” to another tweet that contained a comic edit of Trump replaced by empty space. Trump appears briefly in Home Alone 2: Lost in New York when Culkin, as its hero Kevin, asks him for directions to the lobby of the Plaza hotel, which Trump owned at the time. In an interview with Insider in December 2020, the film’s director Chris Columbus said that Trump “did bully his way into the movie” by insisting he get a role in the film in return for allowing shooting to take place in the hotel. Columbus added that Trump’s cameo was a popular move: “When we screened it for the first time the oddest thing happened – people cheered when Trump showed up on screen. So I said to my editor, ‘Leave him in the movie. It’s a moment for the audience.’” A petition on change.org to replace Trump with Joe Biden had accrued 189 signatures at time of publication.
MLK/FBI review – startling study of the war against Martin Luther King	The FBI’s secret campaign of bugging, harassment and defamation against Martin Luther King Jr in the 60s is the subject of this startling but sometimes frustratingly reticent and guarded documentary. This poisonous dirty-tricks campaign continued until King’s assassination in Memphis in 1968, a murder that the bureau was somehow unable to prevent, despite its fanatical round-the-clock surveillance of King as well as its loudly proclaimed dedication to crimefighting. It is now a matter of record that King was a flawed human being and had extramarital sex, but this is an enduringly mysterious part of his public image. (Even Ava DuVernay’s very fine biopic account of King in her 2014 movie Selma, starring David Oyelowo, tactfully romanticises these indiscretions.) The bureau’s audio tapes of alleged meetings in hotel rooms were finally, in 1977, handed over to the National Archives by order of a federal judge but sealed – they cannot be released until 2027 at the earliest. What exactly will they prove? Anything at all? All we have right now are the typescripts of the agents’ highly subjective summary reports. This film from Sam Pollard, based largely on the work of Pulitzer-winning historian David J Garrow, shows how bizarrely toxic and dysfunctional the FBI’s campaign was, an ongoing secret war that involved running informants within the civil rights movement – a painful and even tragic aspect of this history that probably deserves a documentary of its own. Bureau director J Edgar Hoover was incensed by King’s leftist associations, and by his international celebrity, especially after he was awarded the Nobel peace prize in 1964. After chancing on evidence of his adultery, Hoover hoped to use this to undermine him, and with extraordinary spite circulated the tapes to King’s wife Coretta and even to church leaders and the press, apparently hoping (in vain) that someone would go public. There was even a suggestion that King was present at a rape – and this film, very gingerly indeed, comes close to hinting that there might one day be a #MeToo case to answer. But wait. Where is the proof here? Where is the naming of names? Surely the bureau, with all the dark powers at its command, could have induced one of King’s alleged mistresses to come forward and go public? Apparently not. It is a question that this film does not fully address, although it certainly gives us a queasily detailed picture of Hoover’s pure paranoid nastiness. • MLK/FBI is on digital platforms from 15 January.
Archive review – anyone for a posthuman wife? She comes with an off switch	British illustrator and visual-effects director Gavin Rothery makes his feature debut with this artificial intelligence thriller: a tale of love, death and robotics that has some nicely creepy moments. Set in 2038, it centres on lonely computer scientist George Almore (Divergent’s Theo James), who is holed up in a remote research facility in Japan secretly working on an android version of his wife Jules (Stacy Martin); she has died in a car crash. His prototype, J3 (also played by Martin), is his closest yet to the real thing: a highly advanced humanoid with spookily pale skin who looks like she might be the ghost of his dead wife. Poor old J1 and J2, his earlier, clunkier prototypes: they look on bitterly as the newer, sleeker model gets all George’s attention. The movie opens with sweeping helicopter shots over a snowy forest. Inside the concrete bunker-like facility, Rothery works wonders with a modest budget (he was behind the look of Duncan Jones’s Moon), creating an ungimmicky nearish future that looks a lot like today. When George’s corporate bosses threaten to pull the plug on his research, he hurries to put the finishing touches to J3 – a task involving the contents of a fridge-like archive unit containing his dead wife’s consciousness. George is surrounded by the robot versions of Jules. J1 is boxy, non-verbal and baby-like. J2 is a little more advanced: she can speak, and behaves like a teenager, huffing jealously when George removes her legs to give to J3. In the end, George is playing God – creating a woman not from a rib but electrical components and computer programming. The script’s take on this is romantic: here is a man who’ll do whatever it takes to be reunited with his wife. I couldn’t help finding it a bit more sinister; when J2 misbehaves, George orders her back to her docking station. He is in control. (Anyone for a posthuman wife? She comes with an off switch.) And the final ta-da revelation felt a bit contrived. Still, Archive is refreshingly non-cerebral – and that’s a compliment. It’s a sci-fi movie that wants to entertain, not deliver a lecture on AI. • On digital formats from 18 January.
Armie Hammer drops out of Jennifer Lopez film amid social media controversy	Armie Hammer has dropped out of an upcoming film with Jennifer Lopez after messages allegedly sent by the actor were leaked online. Hammer has described the messages and social media response to them as an online attack, calling them vicious and spurious. Hammer, star of movies including The Social Network and Call Me By Your Name, had been set to appear opposite Lopez in action comedy Shotgun Wedding. However, he will no longer take the role. A production spokesman told the PA news agency: “Given the imminent start date of Shotgun Wedding, Armie has requested to step away from the film and we support him in his decision.” Hammer, 34, became the focus of social media commentary over the weekend after explicit and disturbing messages alleged to have been sent by him were circulated online. Hammer said in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter on Wednesday: “I’m not responding to these bullshit claims but in light of the vicious and spurious online attacks against me, I cannot in good conscience now leave my children for four months to shoot a film in the Dominican Republic. Lionsgate is supporting me in this and I’m grateful to them for that.” Shotgun Wedding will be directed by Pitch Perfect filmmaker Jason Moore and follows a couple who get cold feet before they are due to walk down the aisle. Things are complicated further when the wedding party is hijacked by criminals. Hammer played the Winklevoss twins in The Social Network and starred opposite Timothee Chalamet in acclaimed drama, Call Me By Your Name. He most recently appeared opposite Lily James in a Netflix adaptation of Rebecca. • With Press Association
MLK/FBI review – state-sanctioned harassment of a hero	Sam Pollard’s archive documentary cleverly uses the FBI’s pursuit of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr to tell the entwined history of leftwing protest and state-sanctioned surveillance. Former FBI director J Edgar Hoover feared “the rise of a black messiah” would disrupt the segregated status quo, and so set out to use information about King’s private life, such as his extramarital affairs, to discredit his public persona. Pollard includes clips from movies such as Big Jim McLain and The FBI Story to show how the bureau infiltrated pop culture to cultivate an image of itself as “reasonable, sane and patriotic”. MLK/FBI reframes this as propaganda, and shows how King’s antiracist project was viewed as anti-American political dissent. Pollard’s decision to eschew traditional talking heads in favour of voiceover interviews allows the archive to take centre stage. The director first looked at King in an episode of PBS’s Peabody award-winning Eyes on the Prize II in 1990. Thirty years later, his life remains rich terrain for Pollard, who is keen to consider him as a complicated and fallible man rather than an untouchable icon. • MLK/FBI is available on multiple VOD platforms
Blithe Spirit review – unhappy reimagining of Coward's classic	This asinine adaptation of Noël Coward’s 1941 stage play stars Downton Abbey’s Dan Stevens as author Charles Condomine, who accidentally summons the playful ghost of his late first wife after participating in an ill-advised seance. Stevens plays Condomine as a cliche of a blocked writer, emboldened by booze and misogyny, knee-deep in discarded drafts of a screenplay based on his bestselling crime novel. Edward Hall’s film attempts to send up Condomine for leeching off a female muse, which clashes somewhat with the source material’s “blithe” mood. The impish Leslie Mann is well cast as his dead wife, Elvira, who provides a jolt of creative inspiration. Judi Dench’s screechy caricature of psychic Madame Arcati is less winning. On Sky Cinema
Stardust review – David Bowie biopic has no sparkle	The year is 1971 and David Bowie (Johnny Flynn) is about to embark on his first US tour. Except he only has a tourist visa and so he’s not supposed to perform – convenient, given that the film-makers were unable to secure the rights to any of Bowie’s original music. Its omission is noticeably awkward, with Flynn doing inert versions of tracks Bowie covered, such as Jacques Brel’s My Death, as a clumsy workaround. The narrative centres around a supposedly formative road trip Bowie took with his American publicist Ron Oberman (Marc Maron), suggesting that encounters with Andy Warhol and the Velvet Underground helped give birth to Bowie’s alter ego Ziggy Stardust. Troublingly, flashbacks that look at Bowie’s relationship with his half-brother Terry Burns (Derek Moran) imply that the singer’s family history of psychosis also played a significant part in the creation of his onstage persona. A title card indicates that the film is fictionalised and so perhaps shouldn’t be scrutinised for fidelity. Still, the whole thing feels strangely pedestrian, unable to capture or channel Bowie’s maverick spirit. Available on multiple VOD platforms
Are We Lost Forever review – breakup drama runs out of steam, if not sex	Sheets in disarray, two lovers avoiding each other’s gaze; Swedish director David Färdmar opens his feature debut with an emotional bomb blast in a perfect white bedroom. “So you can’t even say it any more,” spits out Adrian (Björn Elgerd). Finally, Hampus (Jonathan Andersson) concedes: “I love you. But there is no more ‘we’.” Leaving the wounds hidden, this is a promisingly imposing opening scene – but Färdmar, as he charts the pair’s breakup, can’t fully flesh it out in a stiff and increasingly laboured LGBT drama. Initially, it’s a duel for moving-on supremacy. Adrian seems to take the early lead, hooking up with an ex, while Hampus appears the needier, tearfully manipulating him back into bed. But it’s Hampus who strikes out first on a new relationship, while Adrian – resentment weighing behind his eyes – remains hostage to the issues that sabotaged them in the first place. Seeking to give these intimate negotiations epic dimensions, Are We Lost Forever follows in the footsteps of Abdellatif Kechiche’s Blue Is the Warmest Colour, sharing the same taste for establishing its naturalistic credentials through explicit sex scenes. On the other hand, Färdmar struggles to deliver the dramatic money shots. Adrian’s control issues – obvious in the bedroom, and ably conveyed elsewhere by Elgerd’s watchful performance – are made clear. But the film isn’t focused enough to open this trait out into a compelling character study. The often-soapy exchanges in which Adrian masks his hurt before someone reaches across the table mean that the film’s initially well-braced rhythm starts to drag, while Färdmar’s rigid framings are a far cry from Kechiche’s limber entanglement with his lovers. Like its protagonist, Are We Lost Forever can’t break free. • Are We Lost Forever is released on 22 January on digital platforms.
Heroes Don't Die review – reincarnation mystery is on life support	Heroes Don’t Die is the second recent film – after Quentin Dupieux’s absurdist Deerskin, also due in the UK in 2021 – in which French high-flyer Adèle Haenel gets behind a camera to soothe a wounded male ego. Here she plays film-maker Alice, who decides to humour her friend Joachim (Jonathan Couzinié) who, after being collared in a Paris street by an angry Slav, comes to believe he is the reincarnation of Zoran, a Bosnian soldier who died on 21 August 1983 – the day he was born. The pair pack the digicam and head Balkans-ward to track down the truth. Debut director Aude Léa Rapin, co-writing with Couzinié, reaches for Nouvelle Vague-like sprightliness with this meta-filmic setup. But it has the unfortunate effect of spotlighting Heroes Don’t Die’s self-regard and hesitancy over what form to take. If it’s satirising first-person documentaries, it doesn’t keep that subject in sharp focus. The character-study element, as Alice begins to doubt Joachim’s sincerity about his belief in reincarnation, feels expedient. It engages only sketchily with Bosnian history: it situates its story in Bratunac, the next town over from Srebenica. This tempting proximity to seriousness, when a war widow draws parallels between her and Joachim’s situations, leads Rapin towards borderline misjudged musings (“It’s good to tell yourself stories.”) Haenel, the film’s moral centre, is capable of both the Clintonian hauteur she showed in Portrait of a Lady on Fire and a gabbling, caffeinated over-seriousness used to fine effect in 2018 French comedy hit En liberté!, but this film leaves her dashing between the two poles. True to form, though, for the film’s slightly maddening inconsistency, in the final 10 minutes – as Joachim encounters a peasant woman who may or may not be the dead soldier’s wife – a gripping, almost wordless scene delivers pathos, thematic depth and a poetic kick from a glorious Bosnian hillside all at once. Otherwise, it is a largely frustrating exercise; sometimes history is best left in the backdrop. • Heroes Don’t Die is on Mubi from 21 January.
UK reimposes Covid-related travel restrictions on film and TV crew	Film and TV crew are no longer exempt from coronavirus restrictions related to job travel, it has emerged. The UK government’s list of jobs that qualify for travel exemptions has been updated to remove “television production” and “high end television production and film”, which means that executives and crew arriving in the UK will have to isolate for 10 days. The move is a reversal of the widely publicised policy that saw film-makers and crew allowed into the UK in July without quarantine as part of a government drive to get film production in the UK back up and running. Culture secretary Oliver Dowden had made the announcement after apparently consulting with Tom Cruise, whose Mission Impossible films were among the Hollywood productions to restart shooting in the UK in September. Other productions likely to be affected include The Batman, starring Robert Pattinson, which had been halted for two weeks in September after Pattinson tested positive for coronavirus. The only media-related job on the government’s list still exempt from travel restrictions appears to be workers on the BBC’s broadcasting transmission network and services.
About Some Meaningless Events review – attempted murder and the movies	Here is an intriguing, bewildering fragment of what might be called underground new-wave cinema from Moroccan director Mostafa Derkaoui: a docu-fiction shown once in Paris in 1975, but then immediately banned by the Moroccan government after which it disappeared from view, resurfacing in 2016 when a negative was found in the archives of Filmoteca De Catalunya in Barcelona. Derkaoui and a group of other young film-makers are shown hanging out in Casablanca, in a bar and on the streets and at the port, interviewing people about what they think cinema should be doing. Long scenes in bars spool past, apparently semi-improvised, in which the film-makers and their interviewees get very drunk, among lots of other drunk people who are always on the verge of an argument or a fist fight They occasionally ask young women in the bar what they think about cinema and shamelessly tell them they are beautiful enough to be in the movies, asking for their contact details. Then they realise that one of the guys they have interviewed, a man at the port who had claimed to be a teacher, was in fact a dockworker, who had tried to kill his boss – a mob racketeer who was taking most of this man’s pay. And so there are more long conversations (only deadly serious and sober, this time) about whether they can include this footage, about whether this makes them complicit in a crime, or whether this is not an opportunity for precisely the kind of socially engaged cinema they’ve been yearning for. It’s not clear how much of this is real and how much fiction: the entirety of the “murder” may be a reconstruction of a real case. An interesting archive oddity. • About Some Meaningless Events is available on Mubi from 20 January.
12 Hour Shift review – guts and gore in cheerful bad-taste horror	In the 90s, everyone had heard the urban myth about black-market organ trading: the story of the poor chump who went to a party and woke up in a bath of ice minus a kidney. Now, with this blackly funny, cheerfully violent bad-taste comedy-horror, director Brea Grant riffs on the legend. Her film is set in 1999 in the ER unit of an Arkansas hospital where one of the nurses, Mandy (Angela Bettis), runs a side hustle in organ trafficking. Whenever a patient who is unlikely to make it is wheeled in, she earmarks them for harvest – and has even been known to nudge victims along with an injection of bleach. Mandy arrives for the night shift dead exhausted. Patients assume that she is overworked, but the truth is that Mandy is addicted to opiates, slipping vials of morphine into her scrubs pocket. She bankrolls her habit with the organ business, working in cahoots with nursing colleague Karen (Nikea Gamby-Turner). Bettis is terrific, beautifully underplaying Mandy’s bone-dry sense of humour: she is openly contemptuous of patients and their families, rolls her eyes at colleagues and refreshingly has zero anxiety to please. And while she may bump off the odd patient, she is also highly competent. She is not, however, a criminal mastermind. Things go seriously wrong when Mandy recruits her cousin, textbook airhead blonde Regina (Chloe Farnworth), who botches a kidney pick-up. After misplacing the organ, Regina puts on a nurse’s uniform and decides to find another patient to kill. It’s a throwaway film that perhaps I shouldn’t have enjoyed as much as I did, but Mandy is such a deliciously sour character. • Available from 25 January on digital platforms.
Persian Lessons review – hard-to-believe Holocaust survival drama	Here’s a superbly acted, though worryingly polite, Holocaust survival drama by the Ukrainian film-maker Vadim Perelman. It’s the story of a Jewish man from Belgium called Gilles (Nahuel Pérez Biscayart), who stays alive in a transit camp by pretending to be half-Iranian and teaching Farsi to a savage-tempered SS officer, Klaus Koch (Lars Eidinger). In truth, Gilles doesn’t know a word of Farsi; the language he makes up is gibberish, and he lives in constant terror of slipping up, forgetting one of the words he’s invented – almost 600 in six months. The film opens with the line “inspired by true events”, but given the plausibility issues here surely it is safe to prefix that claim with “very loosely”. The setting is France, 1942; Gilles, the son of a rabbi, is transported to a transit camp with other Jews caught trying to flee to Switzerland. A hustler by nature, Gilles easily – too easily – persuades Nazi officer Koch that he speaks Farsi. Koch is a chef by training and dreams of opening a restaurant in Iran after the war. Suspecting Gilles of lying, he grills him, with laughably easy questions: “What is the capital of Persia?” “What language do they speak?” Persian Lessons is more credible as a psychological study – and, if a performance can rescue a film, it’s Biscayart’s portrayal of Gilles. With his gaunt face and perpetually stunned expression, he is the embodiment of Primo Levi’s man who knows no peace, who lives by a yes or no. But Perelman goes light on the audience. He refrains from depicting anything too harrowing – there’s nothing here too brutal or upsetting to make you look away from the screen. This fable about language and memory is a troublingly easy watch – though it floored me in the devastating final moments, unexpectedly acquiring great depth and seriousness of purpose. • Persian Lessons is on digital platforms from 22 January.
LX 2048 review – James D’Arcy lets rip in forgettable dystopian mish-mash	James D’Arcy is one of those good-looking, highly competent British actors who is steadily and widely employed, but seldom gets cast in the main role – apart from, say, playing Edward VIII in Madonna’s memorably panned biopic WE. This quirky, low-budget science-fiction feature gives him a chance to let rip (maybe just a smidge too much at times) as Adam Bird, a depressed middle manager for a technology firm. The American accents everyone puts on, even though most of the cast is British, suggests that events are supposed to be taking place somewhere in North America, though the cityscape, with its glowing monorail and CGI skyline, is pretty obviously a set – in this case a studio in Vilnius, Lithuania. That barely matters because the characters hardly ever go outside, and if they do it’s mainly at night because the sun is now so hot and toxic. Writer-director Guy Moshe has mashed together some solid and recently fashionable dystopian conceits, touching, for instance, on the existential dilemmas of cloning, or the lovelessness of always-online society. However, after a promising start featuring lushly brutalist production design – all concrete, 3D printed plastic and recessed lighting – the concepts start to feel like a less interesting Black Mirror episode, and the last act is a mess. But D’Arcy really goes hell for leather as his character starts to unravel: he faces betrayal from his wife (Anna Brewster), a Mephistophelian inventor (Delroy Lindo) and eventually his own facsimile. Jagged editing with explicatory flashbacks doesn’t make it any easier to parse, and the confinement to a single set for most of the second half evokes experimental fringe theatre, not necessarily in a good way. However, the scene where Adam shags a rubber sex doll will live on in the memory long after you’ve forgotten what the film was actually about. • LX 2048 is available on digital platforms from 25 January.
The Rental review – predictable cabin-in-the-woods scares	Initial high hopes are dashed at the third-act stage of this disappointing cabin-in-the-woods horror-mystery in which actor Dave Franco (brother of James) makes his directorial debut, co-writing with mumblecore film-maker Joe Swanberg. Two couples rent an ocean-front beach house for a luxury weekend getaway: tech entrepreneur Charlie (Dan Stevens) and his partner Michelle (Alison Brie), with Charlie’s brother, Josh (Jeremy Allen White), and Josh’s partner, Mina (Sheila Vand), who is also the co-owner of Charlie’s tech startup. When the foursome arrives, they are instantly nettled by the guy showing them around the property: Taylor (Toby Huss) makes casually racist comments about Mina. And it turns out their ultra-fancy rental has some very strange things about it. Are they being spied on? The dynamic between the four characters is interesting at first, in part because there is already some difficult sexual and social tension between them; it isn’t just the weirdo place they find themselves in. But when the gory/scary stuff really starts happening, the film suddenly loses its dramatic charge. The focus is muddled and uncertain. When tough guy Josh (who we learn has already done jail time for violence) starts taking action against someone who might not actually have done anything wrong, the film starts becoming more of a suspense thriller in which our four hapless heroes have to cover up their own misdeeds. It almost seems as if they themselves are the bad guys, which undermines the potency and the dramatic point of the threat that emerges from the darkness. It’s pretty basic boilerplate, scary-movie stuff, with tropes and tricks that have already been extensively satirised elsewhere. • The Rental is available on Amazon Prime Video from 22 January.
The Exception review – psycho-thriller foiled by lazy sexism	Depressingly, this Danish psychological thriller resurrects some pretty outdated sexist stereotypes with a quartet of emotionally manipulative, unsisterly and two-timing female characters. It comes to us from a trio of men: director Jesper W Nielsen and a script by Christian Torpe, who adapts Christian Jungersen’s bestselling novel about four women working at a small NGO investigating genocide. When they begin to receive death threats, their suspicions turn on each other – and the film plays with the possibility that inside each of them may lurk a crazy psycho bitch. Danica Curcic plays Iben, an earnest researcher who was recently held hostage in Kenya by terrorists. Back in Copenhagen she is experiencing PTSD, at night seeing the child soldier who guarded her, a gentle, soulful-looking boy. Iben works at the NGO with her best friend Malene (Amanda Collin), a beautiful, complicated woman who shows cruel disregard for other people’s feelings. With the team administrator Camilla (Lene Maria Christensen) they snidely gang up on the new librarian Anne-Lise (Sidse Babett Knudsen). It’s Iben who gets the first threatening email. Everyone assumes the sender is a Serbian war criminal – but might it be Anne-Lise? There is nothing wrong with the performances. The best-friend dynamic of Iben and Malene feels nicely complex and plausible – which is more than can be said for the rest of the film. The two women have recently co-authored a book exploring the psychology of war criminals, and its thesis is that most people have something inside them ready to commit evil. And their pass-agg workplace bullying appears to be meant as a small-scale equivalent of that tendency, leading to some truly absurd plot twists as the characters turn on each other. Throughout the film I had the niggling feeling that at the bottom of it is a deep dislike of women – or, at the very least, a total lack of understanding. • The Exception is available on digital platforms from 22 January.
The Wacky Hen review – circus comedy is a flightless flop	This animated Argentinian-Spanish co-production offers a pretty undistinguished tale of a zero-to-hero talking creature (a scrawny, bug-eyed hen named Turuleca, voiced by Elisabeth Gray) who joins the circus and becomes a star – though it’s fair to say that the character, lighting and set designs are often striking. Even so, most of the nice, more-central-to-the-plot characters are very bland, while Turuleca herself is an emphatically hideous creation. On the other hand, there’s a higher degree of craft to the villains and secondary cast members, with their gargoyle faces and stylised figures. The opening act, where our avian heroine is acquired by sweet little old retired music teacher Isabel (Roxanne Bachmann), seems to augur the usual hyper-idealised view of farm life. But when Isabel falls off a roof and has to go to hospital to recover from amnesia, things kick up a notch: Turuleca, on her way to find her mistress, falls in with a troupe of circus folk. The dancing, songs and assorted circus-y antics strike a nice balance between the fantastic possibilities of the cartoon form and enough verisimilitude to keep more literal-minded kids engaged. And it’s a nice touch that this very modern, ethical circus won’t use animal acts because animals can’t give their consent – a rule that’s cleverly circumvented here by having a sentient, talking chicken as its protagonist. The voice acting from the cast for this dubbed-into-US-accented English version is also serviceable if not particularly outstanding. At least the maladroit song translations from Spanish into English create hilariously inept lyrics that sometimes don’t even bother to rhyme. • The Wacky Hen is available on digital platforms from 25 January.
Cannes film festival 2021 to be delayed until July – report	The Cannes film festival will be delayed from its customary May slot until July, it has been reported. According to Variety, the festival’s organisers will announce new dates for the 2021 edition this month, after last year’s event was called off following a series of postponements. According to the report, the organisers have confirmed their resolve to host a physical event in 2021, after the cancellation of Cannes in 2020 dealt a body blow to the international release circuit. If the festival does move from May, July appears the most likely timeslot: later in the year would precipitate a clash with major festivals such as Venice and Toronto, which normally take place in the last week of August or the first week in September; while space in Cannes in June is already taken by the Cannes Lions advertising festival, which is due to go ahead as planned. Variety suggests that the Cannes hotel organisation, the Syndicat des Hotels de Cannes et du Bassin Cannois, has been already told the festival will move to July – normally peak tourist season, but currently badly hit by the pandemic travel restrictions. A local hotelier is quoted as saying: “The dates we’ve agreed on are between July 5-25. So, the festival could start roughly around July 5, or a few days later.” According to an interview in French magazine Les Inrockuptibles, Cannes general delegate Thierry Fremaux has also raised the possibility of extending the festival’s length due to the likelihood of a backlog of high-quality films delayed by the pandemic. After the festival was called off in 2020, Fremaux presented a selection of over 50 films, including Wes Anderson’s as-yet-unreleased The French Dispatch, Pixar animation Soul, which premiered on streaming platform Disney+ in December, and Lovers Rock and Mangrove from Steve McQueen’s Small Axe anthology for the BBC.
Tokyo Dragon Chef review – ramen-themed yakuza musical comedy	Cult Japanese filmmaker Yoshihiro Nishimura, who started off doing special effects before moving into the director’s chair, is best known for pulpy, action-horror fare with self-explanatory titles such as Mutant Girls Squad and Tokyo Gore Police, as well as the more enigmatically monikered Meatball Machine Kodoku. Tokyo Dragon Chef, I’m assuming, lies tonally between the one about gore police and the one about meatball machines given it’s about a pair of ageing yakuza thugs, Ryu (Yasukaze Motomiya) and Tatsu (Yoshiyuki Yamaguchi), who decide to open a ramen restaurant. Their speciality, which does indeed look darn tasty, is a recipe Tatsu honed while doing time and working in the prison’s mess hall, a kind of ma po tofu with ramen. Soon, their tiny venue is drawing rave reviews from YouTubers and a pretty schoolgirl (played by pop star Rinne Yoshida) comes round to sing songs about ramen because – of course – this is also a musical. But then another pair of rival ex-yakuza types (the joke is that all four actors used to play gangsters in straighter films back in the day) start up a food truck business selling ramen across the street. What’s more, they’ve hired a buxom, pink-haired creature in a latex bodysuit (Saiko Yatsuhashi) who may not actually be human and somehow never feels the strain of the enormous quantities of food she can eat. The Japanese dialogue is probably much funnier than the subtitles make it seem, but it’s hard not to suspect that even native speakers might find the film’s concept more amusing than its execution. You have probably seen TikTok videos with more budget than this film. But it’s playful and brisk, and what’s not to love about any movie that has baddies who go around with giant eyeball masks on their heads, just like the immortal experimental punk band the Residents? • Tokyo Dragon Chef is available on digital platforms from 25 January.
The White Tiger review – gripping adaptation of Aravind Adiga's class parable	Powered by a surging, impatient energy and a bracing undercurrent of spite, Ramin Bahrani’s version of Aravind Adiga’s 2008 Booker prize-winning novel is one of the more successful literary adaptations of recent years. The story of a poor but wily driver who claws his way out of the cage created by caste and servitude to become a success story in the new India, it’s not subtle in approach. Nor should it be: it’s a full-blooded assault on a rigged system designed to keep the privileged in their lofty place and the poor on the streets far below. Although it leans heavily on narration, the film’s skittish cinematography brings texture to the backdrop and a satisfying depth to the characters. The narrator is Balram (Adarsh Gourav, excellent in a slippery, hard-to-like role); he’s smart and ambitious, but destined to work on his family’s tea stand. Spotting an opportunity, he learns to drive, masters the flattery that the upper classes expect from their servants, and inveigles himself into a driving job for Ashok (Rajkummar Rao). Balram brings total loyalty to his urbane, US-educated new boss. But loyalty cuts both ways. When Balram is betrayed by his employers, his ingratiating smile curdles, and generations-worth of suppressed anger finally erupts. In contrast to the empathic embrace of Bahrani’s early films (Man Push Cart; Chop Shop), this is harder, more cynical. But we don’t need to warm to the characters to be enthralled by this compulsively watchable class parable. On Netflix
Baby Done review – Rose Matafeo carries tinder-dry pregnancy comedy	A chirpy, good-natured pregnancy comedy from New Zealand, Baby Done is carried by a no-nonsense performance from standup comedian Rose Matafeo. She plays Zoe, a professional tree surgeon who is completely unprepared for her unplanned pregnancy. While her partner, Tim (Harry Potter alumnus Matthew Lewis), embraces the idea of parenthood, Zoe frets over the unfinished adventures on her to-do list. Tinder-dry delivery bolsters the film’s gentle humour, and while the momentum sags a little in the second half, the natural chemistry between Matafeo and Lewis keeps the audience invested and the story relatable.

76 Days review – harrowing account of the incubation of the coronavirus	Winter 2020 in Wuhan, China: ground zero for the coronavirus epidemic. This urgent fly-on-the-wall documentary, shot in four hospitals during the 76 days of lockdown in Wuhan, shows the “fearless soldiers”, as one grateful patient describes the doctors and nurses, on the frontline of a battle with a then unknown foe. It is, at times, harrowing. The film doesn’t shy away from grief at its rawest, fear at its most paralysing. There are moments – the swollen fingers of an elderly patient clinging to the hand of a stranger invisible behind layers of PPE – that are wrenchingly sad. But crucially, there’s also an element of hope and even humour in this affecting tribute to healthcare workers everywhere. On Dogwoof on Demand and other digital platforms
Synchronic review – tiresome time-travellers going nowhere	Here is a squawking, gobbling, factory-farmed turkey, and it’s a shame because its co-creators Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead are a film-making duo known for interesting sci-fi horror fantasy. In 2017, they gave us a very intriguing indie movie called The Endless, in which they also starred as two thirtysomething brothers who 10 years previously had been freed from a sinister cult, but make a strange decision to revisit this creepy brotherhood whose world now seems more interesting than their current banal existence. That was a very atmospheric, if confused film. Sadly, all the problems with it seem to have magnified for this muddled and exasperatingly slow and pointless drama. Anthony Mackie and Jamie Dornan play Steve and Dennis, two careworn paramedics in New Orleans having to deal with the casualties of a new synthetic drug called Synchronic with time-travel powers. The problem with “imaginary drug” films is that they’re an easy and unearned route to excitement, and only a very rigorously clear and consistent narrative, and preferably a humorous script, can make them work. Ariel Schulman and Henry Joost’s Project Power (2020) was another imaginary-street-drug-in-New-Orleans film that was successful because of bright performances from a cast headed by Jamie Foxx. Similarly, Neil Burger’s Limitless (2011), with Bradley Cooper’s washed-up loser getting a mega-IQ boost from a brain pill, was viable as raucous satire. But Synchronic is frankly just silly and tedious, with faintly absurd and jeopardy-free time-travel scenes and a dramatic focus hopelessly split between Dennis and Steve’s separate but equally tiresome lives. There is a laugh when Mackie’s exhausted time-traveller comes back to the present and declares to his video diary: “The past fuckin’ sucks, man.” As does so much else. • Synchronic is available on digital platforms from 29 January.
Beginning review – shocking but shallow tale of religion and bigotry	This is the much-admired feature debut of Georgian director Dea Kulumbegashvili, part of the official selection for last year’s cancelled Cannes film festival, where it might well have been a shock-cinema talking point had the event gone ahead. It is co-produced by the Mexican film-maker Carlos Reygadas, whose influence is very apparent, and the movie as a whole is an intensely, indeed overbearingly, curated and controlled experience. It is a succession of disquieting tableaux, shot mainly from fixed camera positions in which the relevant action can be happening very far away, and one of the speakers can be off-camera for long periods: a cinema in the high style of Haneke, Farhadi and Kiarostami. Yana (Ia Sukhitashvili) and David (Rati Oneli, the co-writer) are a devout Jehovah’s Witness couple with a child who preside over a newly-built prayer house in a remote community. When a religious meeting is firebombed by bigoted locals, David makes an official complaint to the (equally bigoted) police about their marked lack of effort or interest in finding the culprits, and makes a trip to Tbilisi to discuss matters with community elders. Meanwhile, Yana is left behind and is menaced and assaulted by someone claiming to be a cop. The central rape scene is very disturbingly shot and there is also what I admit is a potent final sequence, imagining some kind of retribution or spiritual degradation happening to the assailant in geological time. But there is something inert and frankly shallow in the film: a refrigerated mannerism in which rape and religious beliefs are both kinds of arthouse artefact, not made any more authentic or compelling by the suggestions of Yana’s own ambiguous attitude to what has just happened. Kulumbegashvili’s style is confident, if derivative. Her technique now has to evolve away from these self-conscious influences. • Beginning is available on Mubi from 29 January.
Josep review – haunting tale of an artist adventurer	The Spanish illustrator Josep Bartolí lived enough life to fill a dozen epic biopics. He fought against Franco’s fascists and fled over the Pyrenees into France with 500,000 other refugees in early 1939. After escaping from an internment camp, he made his way to Mexico, where he became a lover of Frida Kahlo. In New York, he was friends with Rothko and Pollock, and designed sets for Hollywood – until his name ended up on the blacklist. Now his life has been turned into a film: not an epic, but a slender and haunting French animation focusing on his years as a prisoner in France. It’s the feature debut of Aurélien Froment, best known as a cartoonist for Le Monde where his work appears under the name Aurel. He frames the film with the fictional story of an elderly French man, Serge (voiced by Gérard Hernandez), who’s telling his grandson about his stint as a fresh-faced gendarme working as a guard at an internment camp. We see him as a young man (voiced by Bruno Solo), a gentle soul with a pleasant face. (He reminded me of a Raymond Briggs character.) His colleagues mock him for refusing to abuse prisoners, who are treated more like criminals than refugees. Secretly, Serge makes friends with one of the Spanish, a handsome man with a magnificent hooked nose, who is constantly drawing – scribbling pictures on cutlery, walls, in the dirt with his finger. He is Bartolí (Sergí Lopez). Aurel draws scenes inside the camp in a grim camouflage of greys and dust browns, and shows us Bartolí’s angry, Goya-like drawings of the horrors: prisoners’ faces ravaged by disease and hunger, contorted with despair. Often the image remains still, the characters’ expressions and movements static – frozen like memories fixed in the brain after all these years. It’s a delicate, thoughtful film, moving and real. Not utterly bleak either, ending with a rampage of colour and life in Mexico – and a brilliantly sweary cameo from Kahlo. • Josep is available on Mubi from 28 January.
Spike Lee compares Donald Trump to Hitler	Spike Lee has likened Donald Trump to Hitler in an acceptance speech at a film critics awards show, adding that “the whole world is laughing at the United States”. The director made his comments when he accepted a special award from the New York Film Critics Circle for his short film New York, New York. The film was released in May 2020 and Lee described it as a “love letter to its people”. Lee said the comments about the Trump were recorded on 6 January, the day of the Capitol breach, which he said was “a very sad day in the history of America”. “We are living in a very serious time in America,” said the director. “His president, President Agent Orange, will go down in history with the likes of Hitler … all his boys, they are going down on the wrong side of history.” Lee has a history of sparring with Trump, including calling him a “motherfucker” over Trump’s response to the 2017 Charlotteville protests, during which activist Heather Heyer was murdered by white supremacist James Fields. Trump accused him of a “racist hit on your president” after an earlier acceptance speech by Lee at the 2019 Oscars.
A Ghost Waits review – haunting, heartwarming romcom	Chock full of delightful narrative surprises, imaginative genre tweaks, and warming performances from its two leads, this low-budget romcom-horror story is worth seeking out. Director Adam Stovall, who co-wrote the script with the film’s star MacLeod Andrews, makes an impressive feature debut with an obviously teensy budget. It’s smartly deployed to cover essentially one set, some theatrical makeup and kit for some fetching black-and-white cinematography that simultaneously recalls vintage-era spooky movies of the 30s as well as too-cool-for-school early Jim Jarmusch films such as Stranger Than Paradise. Andrews’ protagonist Jack is a handyman who works for a property management company. His job is to check over houses for damage and do some light cleaning after tenants move out. However, it looks as if the former residents of an ordinary looking, two-storey suburban house left in a hurry, leaving all their possessions behind; Jack’s boss wants him to find out why so many previous clients similarly skipped out in a rush. Turns out it’s because the place is haunted by Muriel (Natalie Walker), a “spectral agent”, as she insists on being called, who has felt a particular sense of ownership over the building for many years. At first, Jack doesn’t even notice the doors opening by themselves or the lights turning on, but eventually Muriel gets his attention and makes herself visible; the two discover a spiritual affinity of sorts, that grows into a friendship and more. Like Tim Burton’s Beetlejuice, the script’s world-building posits a kind of afterlife bureaucracy in charge of hauntings, albeit one that seems to have gone through a very 21st-century style rebranding that has banished use of the word “ghost”. Muriel is a respected worker, but her boss, officious desk ghoul Ms Henry (Amanda Miller), is determined to undermine her and puts another co-worker (Sydney Vollmer) on the case as well. All of this ensures the film is not in the least bit scary, and clears room emotionally for a conclusion that’s as weird as it is apt and genuinely moving. Choice musical cuts from Honeyhoney, the Bengsons and Wussy further enhance the film’s insouciant street cred. • A Ghost Waits is released on the Arrow player in the UK, US and Canada on 1 February.
Summer of '72 review – tame boy-meets-psychiatric-patient romance	“She might be crazy, or she might be the sanest person I’ve ever met.” Some cringingly obvious lines really lower the tone of this deep south melodrama (released in the US last year with the title Tuscaloosa). It’s an adaptation of Glasgow Phillips’s novel about a white kid in early-70s Alabama: a psychiatrist’s son, he falls in love with one of his dad’s patients. The director is Philip Harder, a veteran music promo maker who evokes time and place with the intoxicatingly intense colour and heightened reality of a William Eggleston photograph. But his film, though well-meaning, is disappointingly tame and soap opera-ish. What it has got going for it is a trio of gusty, heart-on-sleeve performances. Devon Bostick is terrific as Billy, a charismatic dope-smoking drop-out who’s back home in Alabama mooching about, working as a gardener at his dad’s psychiatric hospital. One day, he spots beautiful new inpatient Virginia (Natalia Dyer), who tells him she’s not crazy and that her dad locked her up for being a nymphomaniac. Dyer’s intelligent and sensitive performance does wonders for a character who, on the page, looks like a male fantasy: a cool-girl psychiatric case, fun-loving, free-spirited and up for anything. Marchánt Davis completes the trio as Nigel, Billy’s African American childhood friend. He joins a group of militant civil rights activists and becomes the target of racist cops, but there’s just too much going on to properly explore the dynamics of the two men’s friendship. Another subplot in flashback reveals the death in mysterious circumstances of Billy’s mother when he was a child – a storyline that seems to exist purely to fend off criticism that here we have a film about brutal racism and oppression of women told from the perspective of a privileged white man. • Summer of ’72 is available on digital platforms from 1 February.
Disney removes 'negative depictions of native peoples' from Jungle Cruise ride	Disney is to overhaul its Jungle Cruise theme park attraction to remove what it describes as “negative depictions of native peoples” and to “reflect and value the diversity of the world around us”. The changes were outlined in a blogpost on its Disney Parks website, which included concept art for the redesigned attraction, a simulated riverboat ride originally developed for Disneyland when it opened in California in 1955. It has since been replicated in Disney theme parks in Florida, Tokyo and Hong Kong. In a statement quoted by USA Today, Disney added that its designers “are addressing negative depictions of native people while adding a humorous storyline … this group of adventurers [will] be diverse – in background and fields of interest”. Partly inspired by the 1951 film The African Queen, Jungle Cruise has long been a target of criticism for its inclusion of caricatures of indigenous people as well as a character, Trader Sam, who offers “heads” for sale. A post by design group Thinkwell calls elements of the attraction “horrifyingly racist”. Disney’s redesign of the Jungle Cruise follows its decision, announced in June 2020, to rework its Splash Mountain attraction. Originally inspired by the now repudiated 1946 film Song of the South, Splash Mountain is being modelled on its 2009 animation, The Princess and the Frog, the first to contain an African American princess. A film version of Jungle Cruise, starring Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt, has had its release delayed until July 2021.
God of the Piano review – icy family drama is a virtuoso debut	A classical pianist gives birth to a hearing-impaired son in Israeli director Itay Tal’s impressive feature debut. You could interpret his film as an allegory of tiger parenting and other child-raising techniques with gimmicky names. And the script raises all sorts of questions about whether talent is innate, how far it is influenced by genes, and whether it needs to be developed while young. Tal refrigerates these questions into an elegant and disturbing family drama that has echoes of Michael Haneke: it’s a film with a shard of ice lodged in its heart. Naama Preis is the pregnant pianist, Anat, who is on stage when her waters break. Not missing a beat, she carries on playing, amniotic fluid trickling into her shoe. At the hospital, routine tests reveal that her baby son is deaf – further investigations will be needed. I watched what Anat does next with my hands covering my face; it is a heart-stopping moment of scary-but-not-scary cinema. The story then skips ahead a few years. Anat has given up the piano to focus on moulding her son, Idam, into a musical prodigy. He performs in public for the first time aged seven or so. Later, there’s an unbearably tense scene as he sits down at 12 to play in front of the wider family after dinner. All of them are pianists, and musical greatness is the only measure of success. Anat’s father, a well-known composer, demanding and severe, is hypercritical of the boy’s technique. Through all of this Anat’s face is inscrutable, impossible to read. Is she numbed by guilt or has being raised in this toxic environment warped her self-esteem and sense of family life? Another director would insert epic meltdowns here, but Tal keeps things cool and collected – and his supremely satisfying film gets the job done in 80 minutes. • Available on Your Screen.
Cannes film festival officially delayed from May until July	Cannes 2021 just got hotter. The annual film festival, which prides itself on launching the premieres – and careers – of some of the world’s top directors, will now take place at the height of summer, following concerns over the Covid pandemic. The festival had been scheduled to take place from 11-22 May; now it will run from 6-17 July. “As announced last autumn, the Festival de Cannes reserved the right to change its dates depending on how the global health situation developed,” explained a press release on Wednesday. Variety had reported last week that July was the most likely choice, with organisers extremely keen to host a physical edition of the festival after last year’s was called off following a series of postponements. Holding the event in July would mean that Cannes retains more than a month’s head start on the autumn festivals: Venice, Telluride and Toronto, which begin in late August. The Cannes Lions advertising festival is scheduled to take place as planned in the city’s Palais des Festivals in June. Local hoteliers were reported to be positive about the change as their hopes of a normal tourist season this year rapidly diminished. The event usually attracts some 200,000 visitors to the Riviera hotspot, generating an estimated 200m euros’ (£176m) worth of economic benefits for the area. Cannes general delegate Thierry Frémaux had mooted the idea of extending the festival’s length due to the likelihood of a backlog of high-quality films delayed by the pandemic; this appears to have ditched. After the festival was cancelled in 2020, Frémaux presented a selection of more than 50 films, including Wes Anderson’s as-yet-unreleased The French Dispatch, Pixar animation Soul, which premiered on streaming platform Disney+ in December, and Lovers Rock and Mangrove from Steve McQueen’s Small Axe anthology for the BBC. Premieres at the 2019 edition included Parasite, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Pain and Glory, Sorry We Missed You and Portrait of a Lady on Fire. The Sundance film festival begins later this week in a wholly virtual format. The Berlin film festival, which is normally in February, will now take place in two stages: digital only in March and physical in June.
Twist review – try-hard reboot spray paints over Dickens' tale	Michael Caine already has the distinction of appearing in what many believe is the greatest Dickens adaptation of all time: The Muppets Christmas Carol, in which he played Scrooge. Now he is Fagin in this try-hard modern reboot of Oliver Twist, in which the plot and indeed meaning of the original has been jettisoned, leaving few of the characters – though the original’s tiny, sticky-fingered tealeaves are now promoted to supercool young adulthood. It never really comes to life and there’s a kids-TV feel to most of it, although the free-running scenes are watchable enough, and Caine’s disguise as a grumpy Russian plutocrat with a fake moustache raises some laughs. Rafferty Law (the dead spit of his dad, Jude Law) plays Twist, a young graffiti artist who gets roped into street crime and finds himself hanging out with some cheeky but nonviolent young chancers in Fagin’s employ: a gender-switched Dodge (Rita Ora), and a character called Red (Sophie Simnett), who is in an abusive relationship with another gender-switched character, Sikes, played by Lena Headey. Caine’s Fagin turns out to be a former art dealer ruined by an unscrupulous competitor (enjoyably played by David Walliams), so Fagin plans an elaborate robbery to get his own back on this absolute rotter. And so we are in caper-theft territory, with people disguising themselves as police officers, lowering themselves into lifts from a hole in a ceiling, spray painting over CCTV cameras and pinching Old Masters. Noel Clarke and Jason Maza are Brownlow and Bedwin, the flat-footed coppers on Twist’s trail, but hardly able to keep up with his parkour shenanigans. This movie’s not unlikable, but the action and comedy are under par. • Twist is released on Sky Cinema on 29 January.
The Capote Tapes review – inside the iconic writer's ice-cold mind	There’s a necrophiliac fascination to this documentary about the life and times of Truman Capote, author of the 1958 novella Breakfast at Tiffany’s – filmed with Audrey Hepburn – and the true-crime reportage masterpiece In Cold Blood from 1966. The latter was about the brutal slaying of a Kansas farming family in which the cold-bloodedness of the crime was matched by the cold-bloodedness of Capote’s literary and journalistic performance – befriending the culprits with prison visits and privately agitating for their death penalty to give his book a sensational ending. If anyone had the splinter of ice in the heart that Graham Greene said a novelist needed, it was him. Capote was also a gay man in an era when being one was dangerous, but when those prominent in the arts could hide it in plain sight with extravagant mannerisms. Norman Mailer admired his courage and I found myself thinking of a German word invented by the English writer Ben Schott: schmetterlingsschnauze, or “butterfly jaws” – the toughness of the dandy. This film from Ebs Burnough, based on a cache of audiotaped interviews with Capote’s intimates made by Paris Review editor George Plimpton, is chiefly about the strange case of Capote’s unfinished novel, Answered Prayers. This was his anatomy of the New York idle rich with whom Capote mingled and for whom he threw the supposedly legendary Black and White Ball in New York in 1966, a bafflingly iconic event whose guest list – like the cast of people on whom Answered Prayers is based – now seems mostly like a pageant of wealthy mediocrities and Eurotrash narcissists. Maybe Capote’s novel-fragment attacking them was intended as the definitive, contemptuous dismissal: a final flick of the switch on the electric chair. But the contempt was surely also for himself. When a few chapters were published, it apparently lost him some A-lister friends, though he gained new ones to hang out with at Studio 54 in the 70s, including his acolyte Andy Warhol – who was really Capote’s cultural heir in the new age of celebrity. (This film could have said more about their relationship.) It is salutary to be reminded of a great writer, whose heyday was at a time when literary authors were at the centre of culture. Released on 29 January on digital formats.
The Queen of Black Magic review – derivative gross-out horror	Leaving their home in Jakarta, well-to-do dad Hanif (Ario Bayu), his wife Nadya (Hannah Al Rashid) and their three kids drive to the remote rural orphanage where Hanif grew up. At first, it’s all laughs and backseat bickering – until the car hits something. Having established that the collision was with a now dead deer, they drive off, only for the camera to reveal that the real victim was a child, now dead in a ditch. Up comes the title card, by which point viewers of this Indonesian horror will have some inkling that The Queen of Black Magic isn’t going to mess around. After this unnerving first 10 minutes, there is a long expository lull as an unwieldy cast of characters is introduced. These include the two guys Hanif was best friends with back at the orphanage, their wives, enigmatic servants, two of the current teenage residents, and the dying old man who ran the place. Eventually, after a couple of creepy anecdotes about demons and madwomen locked in bedrooms, the action finally kicks in with a pretty unrelenting stream of horror. Possessions by unquiet spirits result in regurgitated caterpillars, millipedes in eye sockets, someone getting their mouth stapled shut, a woman with an eating disorder mutilating her body, and a bus full of corpses. Then it gets really nasty. Director Kimo Stamboel deploys some clever visual effects and trick camera angles to heighten the gross-out factor – a twist reveals the agent of chaos isn’t just cruel but seeking justice for historical abuse. But ultimately it is all a bit repetitive, derivative (particularly of other Asian horror pics) and somewhat sleep-inducing. • The Queen of Black Magic is available on Shudder from 29 January.
Assassins review – the 'prank show' killing of North Korea's pretender	Nothing to do with the 1990 musical by Stephen Sondheim about the people throughout history who have tried to kill the US president … yet maybe this film should itself be turned into a musical or opera. It is a documentary about the extraordinary 2017 assassination of Kim Jong-nam, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s half-brother, who had been living in exile in China and was not merely a persistent critic of the regime but seen as a possible alternative ruler. Bizarrely, Kim Jong-nam was killed by having VX nerve agent smeared in his face in Kuala Lumpur international airport’s departure hall by two young women, Siti Aisyah and Doan Thi Houng – from Indonesia and Vietnam respectively – who had been duped by North Korean agents posing as TV producers into thinking they were filming a hidden-camera prank show. The Malaysian government quickly and timidly allowed the North Koreans to go free when the regime effectively held Malaysian embassy staff hostage with their families in Pyongyang. So that left the two vulnerable young women facing a mandatory death penalty for murder, just so the Malaysian legal system could indict someone and save face. It is a gripping story, well told by documentary film-maker Ryan White, with the help of two journalists who covered it at the time: Bloomberg reporter Hadi Azmi and the Washington Post’s former Beijing bureau chief Anna Fifield. There is something genuinely chilling about the way the North Koreans groomed and gaslit their two young victims, making them do dozens of supposed pranks on people over many months, with regular payment and spurious reassurance: eerie dummy-run stunts, just to get them used to the technique. Aisyah and Huong were manipulated like young women being sex-trafficked and, in the strangest, unknowing way, like jihadis being schooled for a big attack. (The nerve-agent element has an extra resonance for the UK after the Russians’ novichok outrage in Salisbury in 2018.) Only the state has access to chemical weapons, and their use is designed to send a sickening message of triumphalism and nationalism. What an extraordinary story of sexism, violence, diplomatic bad faith and dishonesty on an international scale. One question remains: who had the bizarre yet satanically clever idea of a fake prank show? And how is it that the North Koreans, supposedly marooned in their Soviet past, managed to dream up something dripping with contemporary media irony? It could be down to a certain mysterious Japanese national who was identified as an accomplice, but never tracked down. Perhaps a true-crime podcast should now be devoted to finding him. • Assassins is available on digital platforms from 29 January.

George Clooney joins reboot of classic sci-fi series Buck Rogers	George Clooney could be heading to outer space once more after it was announced he had joined the team putting together a reboot of the classic sci-fi series Buck Rogers. The Hollywood Reporter writes that the project, written by Under the Dome’s Brian K Vaughan, could be a “starring vehicle” for Clooney, who will be executive producer of the series. The character Buck Rogers is a war veteran who falls into a coma and wakes up in the 25th century. After the success of a late 70s film a TV series followed starring Gil Gerard, as the US army air corps officer, and Erin Gray. Rogers first appeared in the 1920s before becoming a comic book mainstay in the 1930s, with early radio, TV and film adaptations, all before 1950. Clooney is in the awards race for another post-apocalyptic sci-fi project in the guise of Netflix’s The Midnight Sky. He has joined the project as executive producer, alongside his Smokehouse Pictures partner Grant Heslov, while Flint Dille – the grandson of the original Buck Rogers publisher, John F Dille – will produce. There have been aborted attempts to revive the Rogers franchise, with Frank Miller, the Sin City comic book writer turned film-maker, announcing in 2008 he was working on a film adaptation of the story, but it has never seen the light of day. Earlier reports said the reboot would go back to the character’s first appearance in the 1928 story, Armageddon 2419 AD, where Rogers is introduced as a first world war soldier trapped by a cave-in while investigating strange phenomena in an abandoned Pennsylvania coalmine. In the story, Rogers is exposed to radioactive gas and wakes up nearly 500 years later in the 25th century and helps a resistance force attempt to retake the US, which has been taken over by a conquering force. The original 1970s TV show has been part of a boom in nostalgia-fuelled streaming during the pandemic. It forms part of the lineup on Forces TV, the commercial arm of the British Forces Broadcasting Service, a charity that provides TV and radio for members of the armed forces.
Beginning review – a Jehovah's Witness under attack in Georgia	Georgian writer-director Dea Kulumbegashvili’s fierce feature debut, about a Jehovah’s Witness whose faith is tested, opens with an act of hostility. The camera observes from a fixed point at the back of a Kingdom Hall as the space fills and blinds are eventually drawn. Minutes into the service, someone throws a firebomb into the room. The camera continues to watch as flames start to spread. Beginning centres on Yana (Ia Sukhitashvili), former actress and dutiful wife of congregation leader David (Rati Oneli, who co-wrote the film). Yana must navigate both her domineering husband and Alex (Kakha Kintsurashvili), a dangerous man who insists he is a police detective from Tbilisi. Kulumbegashvili draws parallels between the local contempt for Jehovah’s Witnesses – a religious minority in the Georgian mountain town of Lagodekhi – and a broader patriarchal contempt for women. Sukhitashvili’s subtle performance brings interiority to a character who might otherwise be defined entirely by her suffering. The director favours a static camera and extended takes that give her compositions a holy quality. The length of certain scenes feels confrontational, not unlike Chantal Akerman’s long takes in her 1975 feminist classic Jeanne Dielman, 23, quai du commerce, 1080 Bruxelles. Through this rigorous aesthetic, a distinctive point of view emerges. An act of sexual violence takes place in a setting of natural beauty – a babbling brook flanked by wildflowers. The juxtaposition feels like a provocation. • On Mubi
Assassins review – who were the women who killed Kim Jong-un's brother?	In February 2017, at Kuala Lumpur airport, two young women smeared the deadly chemical agent VX across the face of Kim Jong-nam, estranged half-brother of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. He died less than 20 minutes later. CCTV footage of the incident shows one of them wearing a white top emblazoned with the phrase LOL. According to their lawyers, the pair thought they were competing in a YouTube prank show. Perhaps wisely, Ryan White’s slick documentary chooses not to mine the bizarre scene for comic potential. Instead, he spins the arrest of Siti Aisyah and Doan Thi Huong – economic migrants from Indonesia and Vietnam respectively – into a parable about political corruption. • On multiple platforms
Palmer review – Justin Timberlake dominates modest family drama	Former American football star Palmer (Justin Timberlake) has just been released from a 12-year stint in prison. It’s a shock, then, when he ends up having to care for a bullied young boy (Ryder Allen) in this modest family drama. Allen is a little cutesy as Sam, who is obsessed with fairies, dolls and dresses. Still, the film’s treatment of a gender-nonconforming character is clear-eyed. Timberlake can certainly act (see his turn in The Social Network), but the role of hardened, monosyllabic Palmer isn’t a neat fit. The showy singer turned actor struggles to modulate his natural charisma, a flirtatious, extroverted energy repeatedly leaking out where it should be muffled. • On Apple TV
Rival GameStop movies being rushed into production	The GameStop content race is on, even as the Reddit-fueled market rebellion against billionaire hedge funds continues to play out in real time. Netflix is reportedly in talks to ink a film adaptation of the social media David v Goliath saga, in which a small army of online investors upended Wall Street by driving up the prices of shares in the ailing video game chain and other shorted companies, with Mark Boal (Zero Dark Thirty, The Hurt Locker) set to write and To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before’s Noah Centineo attached to star. The as-yet-untitled project would be the second adaptation of the merely two-weeks-old GameStop saga already in development, after MGM acquired rights in a bidding war last week to the book proposal The Antisocial Network by Ben Mezrich, the author of The Accidental Billionaires, which served as source material for The Social Network. That adaptation is set to be produced by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, both played by Armie Hammer in David Fincher’s drama. An auction for the book itself will begin this month. According to Deadline, which broke the news, sources claim the Netflix project would use the recent market frenzy, in which a motley crew of Reddit users and amateur investors targeted billionaire hedge funds’ short-selling bets and sent GameStop stocks surging 135% on a single day, to explore the broader cultural shifts, for good and ill, as social media has leveled the playing field and overruled former gatekeepers. The film will reportedly cover the GameStop saga as well as the proliferation of misinformation on social media and intentionally disseminated disinformation on election fraud, which propelled the pro-Trump assault on the US Capitol earlier this month. This is not the first time Boal has incorporated real-time developments into a fast-track screenplay; following the news that US Navy Seals had killed Osama bin Laden in a 2011 raid in Pakistan, Boal and his directing partner, Kathryn Bigelow, quickly adapted a long-gestating project on the hunt for the al-Qaida leader into Zero Dark Thirty, a thriller on controversial US intelligence techniques and the successful raid.
Running Naked review – feelgood cancer comedy with teen pranks	This awkward British feelgood cancer comedy by director Victor Buhler never entirely comes together, switching from serious to silly and not exactly comfortable in either tone or register. What Running Naked has got going for it are two likable supporting performances by Samuel Bottomley and James Senneck as Mark and Ben, teenage cancer patients who meet in a Manchester hospital. Bored and terrified, they make mischief on the wards. (There’s a funny scene in which they make a break for it, reaching as far as the carpark before realising there’s nowhere to go, and skulk back to their beds.) Skip ahead 15 years, and the film is on shakier ground. Now in their 30s, Mark and Ben (played by Matthew McNulty and Andrew Gower, respectively) survived but live with an increased risk of developing cancer as adults. Mark is a doctor on the same ward where the pair were treated as lads. He’s the more successful of the two, but is held back emotionally by a nagging fear that bad things happen to him. So he laddishly dumps the love of his life, fellow doctor Jade (Rakhee Thakrar), before anything goes wrong with the relationship. Still, he’s loyal to his old mate Ben. Grownup Ben is more problematic. He’s dweeby, anaemic-looking and wears a terrible cardboard-coloured suit – imagine Jarvis Cocker playing Mr Bean. Since remission he has suffered from hygiene-related obsessive behaviours, and there is something questionable in the way his struggles get played for laughs. The script here is unkind and unfunny, and perhaps actually backfires, since many of us can now relate to applying hand sanitiser every five minutes. The plot hinges on a twist you can see coming for miles; this is one of those Britfilms with a sitcom feel. It might have worked better over four or five episodes with sharpening of the script – and more teenage pranks. • Available from 8 February on digital formats.
Clementine review – lakeside retreat harbours damp passions	There is some interesting material in Clementine, but it is an indulgent mood piece, unfocused and unfinished, and one that feels like an idea for a short film, but stretched out to feature length. Otmara Marrero plays Karen, a woman deeply hurt at being dumped by her older, wealthier lover D (Sonya Walger), who has moreover kept Karen’s beloved dog, Ramsey. In an angry, confused and vengeful mood, Karen drives to D’s beautiful lake house, where they had spent so much blissful time together, and breaks in – just to hang out, or somehow to assert herself. But here she encounters Lana (Sydney Sweeney), a disconcertingly smart, beautiful woman sunbathing by the lake, and a weirdly intense relationship develops between the two of them. Exasperatingly, we are asked to stay tuned for long periods of time while the sexual tension between Karen and Lana smoulders inconclusively away, but then the dramatic focus lurches over to Beau (Will Brittain), a hunky guy who has come to do odd jobs around the lake house, but may be spying on Karen on D’s behalf, and may have designs on Lana. Then he, too, is upstaged in the toxic male sexual danger department by some creepy guys Lana knows, claiming to have contacts in the LA movie business. They have a video camera at their place and give innocent Lana an “audition”. Afterwards, this is the subject of an actor-ish monologue by Lana, which itself feels like an audition piece. (It certainly should go on Sydney Sweeney’s showreel.) Where are we going with all this? Nowhere very satisfying: there is a lot of non-suspense leading to non-thrills and non-revelation of character. The performancesby Marrero and Sweeney, though, are perfectly fair. • Released on digital formats on 8 February.
Winter Flies review – teen tearaways ride their luck with a smile	Winter Flies’ two teen runaways, as they make a break across country in their hot-wired Audi, are prone to spontaneously breaking out in incredulous laughter; that’s the guiding spirit of this unforced, inquisitive and winningly optimistic Czech road movie. There’s a hint of unspecified family troubles in their rear-view mirror, but the underage drivers – blasé loverman Mará (Tomáš Mrvík) and rotund Heduš (Jan František Uher) – are more focused on heading anywhere-but-here. Recounted in cross-cut flashback from the police station where Mará is being interrogated on his own (with Heduš’s fate unknown), the duo use the journey time to trade their obsessions: joining the Foreign Legion, sleeping-bag protocol, Mará’s supposed military hotshot granddad and, of course, getting laid. These kind of semi-delusional adolescent hobbyhorses could have ended up as a Superbad-style gag-fest, but Slovenian director Olmo Omerzu patiently teases out a subtler humour and pathos. Nuzzling tightly to the actors’ perspective, Omerzu in his third feature comes close to the kind of miraculous naturalness Hirokazu Kore-eda achieves in his films. Mará proves to have a tender centre, something first relayed when he saves a dog from drowning. There’s an initial suggestion that he may be an unreliable narrator, and Mrvík, pink-cheeked but with a testy gaze, holds the screen with star conviction. But the film finally has no heart for any guile and remains beautifully sincere. In one sequence, Mará falls asleep at the wheel, and the car appears to be driving itself down a snow-streaked Czech highway, as if on the momentum of insolent bravado and the innocence of dreams. • Available from 29 January via YourScreen. • This article was amended on 8 February 2021 to correct the main image credit information.
Eye for an Eye review – Travolta goes sleuthing in Texas	John Travolta stars in this ridiculous and mostly boring hardboiled thriller (AKA The Poison Rose), playing a private detective investigating the disappearance of a woman from a psychiatric hospital. The web of interlinked crimes he unravels barely makes any sense and there are some epically pointless plot twists – one left me so baffled that I wondered if I might’ve momentarily nodded off and missed a scene. It’s a film with no energy, not much pace and few signs of life. It’s exhausting to watch. Travolta goes beyond “world-weary” to give an almost vegetative performance as Carson Phillips, a PI in the poker-playing, bourbon-drinking tradition. In his youth, Phillips was the star quarterback on the local football team but skipped town after a scandal. Back in Texas for the first time in a couple of decades, he gets short shrift at the hospital where the patient has vanished. The doctor in charge (Brendan Fraser) shiftily evades his inquiries and the nurses shoot each other alarmed looks. Morgan Freeman plays casino owner Doc, the richest man in town and clearly not to be trusted. (Like everyone else here, Freeman puts his feet up, taking a breather from doing decent acting.) Wouldn’t you know, it turns out the town is riddled with crime, corrupt to the core. Phillips repeatedly drawls on the voiceover that he’s a sucker for a beautiful woman with a sob story – so inevitably one of the dead bodies is linked to his teenage sweetheart whose daughter (played by the actor’s daughter Ella Bleu Travolta) is accused of murder. It’s a preposterous plot, with a damp-squib ending, and like an episode of Dallas, the dialogue gets phonier and phonier. “This is a bad place. Far worse than you can imagine.” Ditto the film. • Released on 5 February on Amazon Prime Video.
A Nightmare Wakes review – Mary Shelley battles her inner monsters	Here is an earnestly intended psychological drama about Mary Shelley, and her relationship with Percy Bysshe Shelley, Byron, Polidori and Claire Clairmont during that legendary summer in 1816 on Lake Geneva when Byron challenged everyone to write a ghost story – and Mary conceived of Frankenstein, so commercially outpacing the literary alpha males and anticipating the modern world in ways far beyond them. The film’s drama centres on the trauma of her pregnancy and childbirth, yoking together the ideas of her dark imagination with pre- and postpartum depression, as well as the patriarchal male-author myth – Percy is shown being threatened by Mary’s creativity and sensuality. It is an idealistic and heartfelt film, but also precious and self-conscious with some pretty callow performances, like a student production at the Edinburgh fringe. What it also appears sometimes to be doing is making a play for some old-fashioned horror scares, in honour of Mary Shelley’s enduring creation, with periodic hallucinatory flashes of Mary (Alix Wilton Regan) looking as she perhaps imagines herself to be – gaunt and monstrous and demonic, approaching a kind of emotional breakdown. But the film can’t quite make up its mind if it wants us to surrender to out-and-out genre thrills, or if we should be taking a step back and responding on a loftier literary-historical level, considering the sexual politics that lay behind the production and consumption of the Frankenstein myth. Philippe Bowgen is a ridiculous and roistering Byron, often shown with his shirt half-off, sensuous, anarchically laughing and wine-quaffing, while Giullian Yao Gioiello is a blandly unsympathetic Percy Shelley. It’s a dry and somewhat lifeless tableau. • Released on 4 February on Shudder.
Birds (Or How to Be One) review – flighty avian-themed drama-doc	Two-thirds of the way into this experimental Greek docu-fiction, one of the wandering souls featured – apparently watching footage from the film – loses his rag. “This is not about birds. It’s about us being crazy as loons. Come on Babis, I’m a customer here, too, I need to understand.” With director Babis Makridis showing all the confrontational strangeness of the Greek new wave here, the exasperation is understandable. What Makridis has cobbled together is a poetic and initially utopian manifesto for self-liberation inspired by Aristophanes’ play The Birds, in which a king transforms into a hoopoe. In nine chapters with titles such as “Find your voice” and “Take off, land”, Makridis quizzes the characters in poker-faced interview setups about their hopes of becoming birds, and observes these avian wannabes as they make strange fluttering calls on urban streets and roam stark landscapes in search of their inspiration, “Mr Hoopoe” – all intercut with performance excerpts from Aristophanes. The precise significance of all this remains up in the clouds with the aerobatic planes he marvels at; although the assemblage starts to drum up an almost shamanistic mania as people perfect their bespoke bird caws and incant against a lightning-blasted cityscape. Perhaps the lack of easy graspability is trying to jar us into a similar consciousness shift, to get modern society soaring above its current disillusionment. Whether this utopia is psychological or social, it quickly recedes; the mood darkens. Makridis takes us to a grillhouse to illustrate lines from Aristophanes about the indignities visited on birds. “Then they stuff their entire hands into your innards, and they tear out your heart, your spleen and your little liver.” Someone rants about avian aspirations offending the gods. By this point, Makridis’s melding of his elements has become a bit lumpen, and his own self-referential cameo in the film after a cast member complains – breaking the generally forthright mood – seems almost an admission he is losing control of his message. This metamorphosis is only semi-achieved. • Birds (Or How to Be One) is on Mubi from 8 February.
Modern Persuasion review – Austen in Manhattan is a load of old bonnets	Do we need a defensive ring of steel petticoats erected around Jane Austen’s novels – something, anything to stop them being updated into perky formulaic romcoms like this? Modern Persuasion is, to state the obvious, a modern version of Austen’s last (and arguably best) novel Persuasion: the story of Anne Elliot, who at 27 – still a mere slip of a girl – is staring down the barrel of spinsterdom. Eight years earlier she made the terrible mistake of turning down an offer of marriage from a penniless naval officer. The film-makers have meticulously transferred the book’s characters and plotting – and, to be fair, some of its warmth – to modern-day New York. But lost in adaptation is any trace of Austen’s wit and razor-sharp satire. That said, Alicia Witt brings several shreds of dignity to the role of single gal Wren Cosgrove, a highly-flying PR exec living in New York with her cat. The boyfriend she never got over is her college ex Owen (Shane McRae, performing with the charisma of a wardrobe). After graduation, Wren refused to move to San Francisco with him. Now he’s a tech billionaire; though pointedly not a douchebag since his new project is a charity-giving app. When the pair accidentally meet up again – after he hires her firm to do his PR – Owen acts frostily like they’re strangers. Instead he flirts with Wren’s two young assistants (nicely played as irritating yet endearing by Daniella Pineda and Tedra Millan). Here the script misses a trick; it could have mimicked Austen, skewering the social hypocrisy of men marrying younger women while women of the same age are deemed to be mothballed – plus ça change. But instead the film mostly satirises the assistants’ aggressively millennial social media abbreviations – impenetrable to the oldies. Still, the biggest crime against Austen, and the film’s fundamental flaw, is turning woman-of-substance Anne Elliot into yet another romcom thirtysomething cat lady sighing dreamily at the Manhattan skyline while waiting for Mr Right. • Modern Persuasion is on digital platforms from 8 February.
The Recce review – crossing enemy lines in South African action-drama	This South African-made action-drama unfolds against the background of a conflict little known about above the equator, much less used as a setting for film – the Namibian war of independence from 1966-90, AKA the South African border war. Often considered South Africa’s version of Vietnam, it was, among other things, a proxy fight between South Africa, then still under apartheid, and its allies at the time, and the People’s Liberation Army of Namibia, who were backed by the Soviet Union and Cuba. Although there’s a fair amount of on-screen contextualising in the opening minutes to explain key terms and ideas, The Recce feels made for a local audience that has a grasp of the cultural and historical background. That means it’s not easy for outsiders to read the ideology of this stylised, fictional account of an elite Afrikaner soldier, Henk Viljoen (Greg Kriek), the “recce”, who is ordered to go across enemy lines alone one last time to kill a Russian officer. Henk leaves behind his pregnant wife Nicola (Christia Visser), with whom we spend a lot of screen time as she looks anxious, remembers happier moments in her marriage and visits Henk’s parents, who are sick with worry about their son. In the narrative mix is Captain Le Roux (Grant Swanby), an English-speaking South African officer who is also worried about Henk and the general madness of the war. All three have internal monologues where we hear their poetic musings as the visuals show slow-motion action, often backlit with the blazing African sun, or drinking in the vast, awe-inspiring landscape. I’m guessing writer-director Johannes Ferdinand Van Zyl has been huffing Terrence Malick movies, particularly the ones about sensitive manly types, such as The Thin Red Line and The Tree of Life. At any moment you expect Kriek to do a magical backflip in slo-mo as the soundtracks keens mournfully and magic hour breaks across the bush. The characters of colour, such as the many indigenous people Henk shoots on his way in and out of Angola, don’t get to share their thoughts in dreamy voiceovers, which smacks more of oversight rather than overt racism. Nevertheless, the end result feels limited and ultimately a little pointless. • The Recce is available on digital platforms from 8 February.
Bliss review – epically bad acting in tiresome sci-fi fantasy	There is some epically bad acting in this silly and tiresome sci-fi fantasy-mystery from writer-director Mike Cahill, whose renowned debut Another Earth in 2011 left me sceptical, yet intrigued. But this is a conceited mess, which almost from the very first frame tips you off that we are heading for some version of the time-honoured cheat/twist ending that has – admittedly – been with cinema since its earliest days and attracted some of the biggest directorial names. Owen Wilson plays Greg, a stressed and ill-looking guy who is working in a call centre firm called Technical Difficulties, the job being to help people on the phone with their problems. He has a corner office, so is presumably a big cheese. But Greg is slacking off, more concerned with doodling some dream city of his own imagination. He also has a strained relationship with his grownup daughter Emily (Nesta Cooper), who is about to graduate from college. Greg is estranged from Emily’s mother and talks about having “messed up”. But after a calamitous confrontation with his boss, he winds up in a scuzzy bar where he meets a Manic Pixie Grownup Tramp Woman called Isabel, played with unbearably peculiar mannerisms by Salma Hayek. Isabel red-pills Greg about the false nature of the universe: it’s all a digitally created illusion apparently – digitally created by Isabel, in fact – and now Greg is going to discover the truth, just as he is in full, traumatised retreat from the emotional pain in his personal life. Every syllable of action, as we grind towards the broadly guessable finish, is jeopardy-free and interest-free. Wilson looks as if he is thinking about something else: the halting sing-song rhythms of his voice sound vapid, and Hayek is trilling, whooping and smirking away in a world of her own. • Released on 5 February on Amazon Prime Video.
Sia apologises over autism depiction in her movie Music	Sia, the musician whose debut film earned two Golden Globe nominations on Wednesday, has addressed concerns about the movie’s depiction of autism. Writing on her Twitter account, which she shortly afterwards deleted, the artist said that she has “been listening” to the criticism surrounding the film’s portrayal of a nonverbal autistic person, played by Maddie Ziegler, who does not have autism. She said the film will now be preceded with a warning that reads: “Music in no way condones or recommends the use of restraint on autistic people. There are autistic occupational therapists that specialize in sensory processing who can be consulted to explain safe ways to provide proprioceptive, deep-pressure feedback to help with meltdown safety.” She then tweeted: “I’m sorry,” and said she plans to remove the restraint scenes from future prints. “I listened to the wrong people,” she said, “and that is my responsibility, my research was clearly not thorough enough, not wide enough.” This week, Music was the surprise recipient of two Golden Globe nominations: one in the best musical or comedy category and one for lead actress Kate Hudson. Last November, Sia first engaged online with autism rights activists who felt she was approaching the condition from the perspective of a neurotypical person, as was her leading performer. At that time, Sia remained robust in her defence of the film, writing: “The movie is both a love letter to caregivers and to the autism community. I have my own unique view of the community, and felt it is underrepresented and compelled to make it. If that makes me a shit I’m a shit, but my intentions are awesome.” A petition asking for the film to be cancelled subsequently gained more than 17,000 signatures, and the petition page was flooded with responses from people unhappy at both Sia’s approach in the film and her “lack of remorse”.
Lost Girls and Love Hotels review – submission and secrets in erotic Tokyo drama	Author and artist Catherine Hanrahan has adapted her novel of the same name for the screen and William Olsson directs. It is the story of Margaret, a young American woman in Tokyo, who has snagged a job teaching trainee flight attendants how to enunciate their English properly. Margaret drinks a lot, parties a lot, shows up hungover and late to work; she is also into BDSM, and is a sub, but can’t find any satisfactory partner, until she chances across Kazu (Takehiro Hira), a yakuza mobster whose naked body naturally turns out to be almost completely covered in scary tattoos. He has exactly the right fiercely negligent ruthlessness when he takes her to love hotels, but through an ironic quirk of fate turns out to have a softer side – something that this liaison with Margaret has unlocked, and in bed confesses to her mournfully that he is about to get married, and this lends something weirdly poignant and melancholy to their eroticism. The film isn’t perfect, and there is a touch of orientalism about the obsessive-affair-with-Japanese-man trope (which surfaced also in Wash Westmoreland’s The Earthquake Bird in 2019). But there is also something well controlled in the movie as it maintains its cool, even pace and Alexandra Daddario’s performance as the vulnerable, secretive yet emotionally open Margaret is smart. There is also good support from Carice van Houten as Margaret’s cheerfully cynical expat friend Ines and also from Misuzu Kanno as Nakamura, the older woman who is Margaret’s employer, balancing her competing impulses towards caring and disapproval. • Released on 8 February on digital formats.
A Glitch in the Matrix review – deep-dive into simulation theory	With Room 237, a deep dive into theories about Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining, writer-director-animator Rodney Ascher practically invented a new sub-genre of documentary: the fathoms-five-low inspection of fandom theories and nuttery. Tonally blending sympathetic dispassion and ever-so-slight amused mockery over a fast-shuffling montage of clips that just fit under the bar of fair use, Ascher’s technique created a fascinating brainstorm essay equally about cinema, spectatorship and the ability of works of art to generate interpretations well beyond the intentions of their makers. His latest, A Glitch in the Matrix, pulls off the trick again, appropriately enough on an even bigger scale. This time the subject is simulation theory: the hypothesis that we are all living inside a synthetic world, like the human beings in The Matrix movies who are kept in pods, jacked into a giant supercomputer that injects a delusion straight into their brainstems. The film interviews individuals with differing opinions on simulation theory: some philosophers, some journalists and some likable kooks who fervently believe they’re living in a simulacrum, a few of whom appear disguised in digital avatar get-ups that add a bizarre comic layer. Elsewhere there’s a long archive clip of the great sci-fi seer of simulation theory, Philip K Dick, giving a lecture in the 1970s on his theories about slippery realities that he channelled into his books The Man in the High Castle and Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said. Ascher deploys abundant clips from the Matrix films and the many film adaptations of Dick’s fiction, but there’s plenty of his own original animation to illustrate some of the stories, including an account from one young man who killed his parents because he thought he was in the Matrix and nothing mattered. Parents of adolescent and younger kids will be interested to see Minecraft world-building is also in the mix, along with Plato’s allegory of the cave, the Mandela effect and Elon Musk talking about artificial intelligence. What’s missing from this fecund brew, which you could imagine being twice as long, is any kind of judgment or analysis of the subjects. It’s up to the viewer to notice that some of the interviewees talk of deeply religious upbringings or receiving a diagnosis of schizophrenia, which might explain the roots of their beliefs. Or maybe they’re right and we are all living in a simulation. • A Glitch in the Matrix is available on digital platforms from 5 February.
Trump resigns from Screen Actors Guild before they can expel him	Donald Trump has resigned from the Screen Actors Guild (Sag-Aftra), the union for US performers on film and TV, as the union’s leadership began moves to expel him. In a letter dated 4 February 2021 and addressed to Gabrielle Carteris, the union’s national president, Trump said: “I write to you today regarding the so-called Disciplinary Committee hearing aimed at revoking my union membership. Who cares!” Citing his appearances in Home Alone 2, Zoolander, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps and the TV show The Apprentice, Trump added: “I’ve also greatly helped the cable news television business (said to be a dying platform with not much time left until I got involved in politics), and created thousands of jobs at networks such as MSDNC and Fake News CNN, among many others.” After claiming the union “has done little for its members, and nothing for me”, Trump finished his letter saying: “I no longer wish to be associated with your union. As such, this letter is to inform you of my immediate resignation from Sag-Aftra. You have done nothing for me.” The union responded with a two-word statement: “Thank you.” Trump’s move follows an announcement by Sag-Aftra in January that Trump was being referred to a disciplinary committee after the Capitol breach and what the union described as “a reckless campaign of misinformation aimed at discrediting and ultimately threatening the safety of journalists, many of whom are Sag-Aftra members”. Carteris said at the time: “Donald Trump attacked the values that this union holds most sacred – democracy, truth, respect for our fellow Americans of all races and faiths, and the sanctity of the free press. There’s a straight line from his wanton disregard for the truth to the attacks on journalists perpetrated by his followers.” According to financial reports disclosed in 2020, Trump currently earns a pension of over $98,000 for work on union-covered projects, which would not be affected by his leaving.
Rams review – Aussie remake of a dour Icelandic delight	Sheep-farming brothers Colin (Sam Neill) and Les (Michael Caton) are linked by blood. Not just their own but also, like generations before them, the bloodline of the rare breed of sheep they raise on their scratch of land in Western Australia. The feud between these bristling, taciturn men has festered for decades: they haven’t spoken in 40 years. When a deadly disease is diagnosed in Les’s prize ram and the authorities order a livestock cull in the valley, his response involves whisky and a shotgun. But Colin is cannier. Can the brothers finally find common ground? Adapted from Grímur Hákonarson’s acclaimed 2015 film, this version trades frostbitten Nordic reserve for a broader comic approach. It works on the assumption that a story about grumpy old gits united against a common foe has a universal appeal. True, to an extent, but what the makers of this film fail to realise is that it was the specificity of the Icelandic original that made it such a glumly hilarious delight.

A Glitch in the Matrix review – a mind-blowing dive into simulation theory	As a documentarian, Rodney Ascher is more comfortable than many with subjectivity. Having previously delved into a host of far-fetched theories about Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining with Room 237, Ascher now explores “simulation theory”: the belief that the world in which we exist is artificial – a rendered reality; part of a game or experiment controlled by a higher intelligence. The jumping-off point for this elliptical combination of computer animation, archive footage and virtual interviews is a 1977 lecture by Philip K Dick. But the development of the idea is traced from Plato’s allegory of the cave and numerous religions, through films, literature and computer gaming, to current advocates such as Elon Musk. It’s a messy, mind-blowing collision of philosophy, technology, religion and fruit-loop paranoia which, while it doesn’t exactly make a watertight case, does provide a fascinating, and in one case deeply disturbing, insight into the thought processes of those who believe it. • On multiple digital platforms
From the archive: Kingsley Amis and his love of horror films, July 1968	The novelist Kingsley Amis wrote about being a horror film addict for the Observer Magazine of 7 July 1968 (‘Terror in the Cinema’). This is surprising because Amis had an extreme fear of the dark and of being alone. Of course, this being Amis, he objected to the popular term. ‘Terror film would be a better label,’ he argued, because ‘they are not symptoms of the sickness of our society’. Amis was an anti-intellectual when it came to genre films – ‘eggheads out!’ – preferring to simply enjoy the ‘cavortings both abominable and harmless’. Indeed, when he wondered what the appeal of the horror film was, he wrote: ‘Like Mark Twain on a dissimilar occasion, I have an answer to that: I don’t know.’ He argued that ‘The adult Western, like Bad Day at Black Rock, demonstrating its seriousness by short-changing us on action, has not made its mark.’ That may have been true, but it certainly wasn’t true of the John Sturges noir classic. ‘The psychological thriller, under Hitchcock, has done better,’ Amis said, ‘though it only really clicked when it abandoned the supposedly deep probing of Spellbound for the fairly straight and very enthusiastic Grand Guignol of Psycho.’ He admired the US contribution to ‘the great horror revival’, especially that of Vincent Price ‘whether receiving or dealing out assorted gory treatments’. Difficult also to disagree with his assessment of ‘one of the best horror episodes of all’ – the ventriloquist’s-dummy sequence in 1945’s Dead of Night. Amis had an amusingly hard time suspending his disbelief in The Fly: ‘Here, the hastiest of mumbo-jumbo was run through with the palpable design of proceeding to the disagreeable activities and physical appearance of a fly with a chap’s head and a chap with a fly’s head… Even science-fiction ought to have balked at the idea of giving both these characters some kind of human intelligence.’
If It Were Love review – a dance doc powered by the exuberance of youth	There is a delicate mixture of sensuality and creativity in this documentary. Patric Chiha follows the rehearsal and performance of a dance piece called Crowd by the Franco-Austrian artist and choreographer Gisèle Vienne, about the 90s club scene. The film follows the dance itself and stages one-on-one conversation scenes in which the young dancers talk about each other and the characters they play – a higher gossip, perhaps, about their lives and how this fictional creation shapes their sense of themselves and their sexuality. Compared with, say, Gaspar Noé’s orgiastic dance movie Climax, If It Were Love is certainly more calm and less mad, more ruminative and less confrontational. Perhaps what it is about fundamentally is youth, something each dancer radiates unknowingly: a pure energy and abandon and openness. It would be better to witness this dance piece live (a Covid-era yearning) but there is something interesting in seeing this eternal theme of youth explored and embodied. A dancer might talk about how a kiss did not happen with another character on stage – or, alternatively, that it did happen – and the exchange feels personally charged and intimate, like a conversation taking place after a party, with people confiding who they think they are in love with. And of course to some extent these conversations themselves are fictional performances, which the film builds into the official choreography. If It Were Love is probably more of a festival event film than anything, but it is valuable and pregnant with ideas. • Released on 11 February on Mubi.

The Twentieth Century review – Canadian satire dials up the quirk	Matthew Rankin is an experimental Canadian film-maker now presenting his debut feature, and the director he most obviously resembles is the silent-movie pasticheur Guy Maddin – a comparison some will find intriguing and others heart-sinking. For me, it’s somehow both. But there are interesting signs that Rankin has something Maddin does not: a sense of humour. We get one or two actual laughs. The Twentieth Century is a weird melange of expressionist theatrics, monochrome and bleached-out colourisations (although it is not faux-silent in the Maddin style, and no scratches on the print), sometimes resembling a stage-play. It is a quirky dream-comedy about Mackenzie King, Canada’s venerable Liberal prime minister and establishment panjandrum, which satirises the country’s stolid colonial traditions. King – or a fictionalised version of him – is played by Dan Beirne as an earnest, priggish young careerist with a Stan Laurel-ish bowler hat. He yearns to be prime minister, subservient to the British colonial establishment, symbolised by a national flag called the “Disappointment”. King is also in love with his political rival’s daughter Ruby (Catherine St-Laurent) but finds himself drawn to his elderly mother’s Francophone Quebecers separatist nurse (Sarianne Cormier) and there are bizarre sexual shenanigans, as King derives secret pleasure from sniffing Catherine’s discarded boot. It is funny when King and his competitors have to go through a series of wacky tests (in lieu of anything like a democratic election) to see if they have the right stuff to be a properly pompous and pointless Canadian prime minister. Finally, the film dissolves in silliness and whimsy, but not before it’s given us some surreal spectacle. • Released on 15 February on Mubi.
Letter: Michael Apted obituary	In 2005 Michael Apted, then president of the Directors Guild of America, sent me an email saying that he wanted to set up a meeting of British film and television directors, to seek to counteract the disastrous erosion of their rights, creative and financial. I had been his assistant at Granada TV 30 years earlier. Three months later more than 100 people, few of whom knew each other personally, gathered in central London. Michael spoke quietly, pointing out that we were represented by multiple organisations and that this was a catastrophic weakness. A group of us volunteered to meet again and two years later a powerful single voice, Directors UK, emerged. It would not have done so without Michael’s gentle but firm insistence.
Breeder review – muddled torture porn horror	A movie from Denmark that sounds enjoyably bizarre but actually amounts to a yucky helping of torture/imprisonment porn and gonzo violence. Sara Hjort Ditlevsen is Mia, a stylish woman with a liking for horses and BDSM. Her rich but dull husband, Thomas (Anders Heinrichsen), is squeamish about gratifying Mia’s tastes, but hardly squeaky clean. He is a secret investor in a creepy eternal-youth genetic treatment programme, being developed by the couple’s sinister neighbour Dr Isabel Ruben (Signe Egholm Olsen), who looks 40 but is actually 60 and has some sort of hold on Thomas; she is now kidnapping young women off the streets for her research like a latter-day Elizabeth “Blood Countess” Báthory. Mia tries investigating Dr Ruben’s loathsome facility and finds herself walled up there as well. The hero/villain dynamic in this film gets muddled, which is important for this kind of horror-melodrama: Mia is at first presented as not very nice – arrogant, maybe, infatuated with wealth and status, and nursing unresolved feelings about her dark taste in transgressive sex. But other people then easily trump her nastiness and Mia has to be a sexualised victim-heroine in the evil torture-dungeon scenario (although her BDSM is now presented as ironic). Thomas’s split loyalties, meanwhile, make him seem feeble rather than complex. As for Dr Ruben, she has a Rosa Klebb-like energy that would be interesting in a less humourless film. • Available from 15 February on digital formats.
Dead Pigs review – winding tale of life in cash-crazed Shanghai	A breezily westernised style of Chinese movie is on offer in this 2018 debut feature from Chinese-American film-maker Cathy Yan, who two years later went to Hollywood to direct Birds of Prey, starring Margot Robbie. Dead Pigs is an ensemble dramedy set in Shanghai that satirises – in a distinctly lenient way – the commercialism eating away at China’s heart. It is inspired by a real-life incident in which thousands of dead pigs were found in the city’s Huangpu river, dumped by poverty-stricken farmers who couldn’t pay the disposal fees; the pig symbolism reminded me a tiny bit of Alan Bennett’s A Private Function. Candy Wang (Vivian Wu) is a beauty salon owner who lives in her parents’ rickety old house, the only one standing in a rubble-strewn waste ground, because she is holding out against offers from a property company called Golden Happiness; it wants to build a bizarre Vegas-style development there based on Barcelona, complete with a tacky replica of the Sagrada Família. Her brother Old Wang (Haoyu Yang) is in dire financial trouble after borrowing money from gangsters to fund his absurd “investment portfolio” in pigs, which have all died. Old Wang’s son Zhen (Mason Lee) is a hard-up waiter who pretends to his dad he’s doing well; he befriends wealthy Instagram-style princess Xia Xia (Meng Li) and soon finds out how lonely and unhappy she really is. Meanwhile, Golden Happiness have hired a smooth American architect called Sean (David Rysdahl), whose US qualifications are phoney: he has been recruited by another American, Angie (Zazie Beetz), for sideline work as a model for promo events, pretending to be an American celeb or reality TV star. The movie zings and pinballs around, ricocheting within its ironic pattern of coincidences, and those dead pigs keep bobbing metaphorically up, reported by TV news broadcasts – always a cheesy and unconvincing storytelling technique. Dead Pigs is an unassuming topical entertainment (rather different from the movies of its executive producer Jia Zhangke), but diverting and well-acted. • Released on 12 February on Mubi.
Moufida Tlatli, Silences of the Palace director, dies aged 73	Moufida Tlatli, the pioneering Tunisian film-maker behind much-admired festival hits The Silences of the Palace and The Season of Men, has died aged 73. News media said that she died on Sunday, with the news confirmed by the Tunisian ministry of culture. Tlatli remains best known for her breakthrough 1994 feature The Silences of the Palace, a lyrical study of a woman’s return to an abandoned royal residence, which tackled the themes of exploitation and trauma as experienced across generations of Arab women. It won a string of international awards, including the Sutherland trophy at the London film festival for the most “original and imaginative” film of the year, and was named as one of Africa’s 10 best films by critic and director Mark Cousins. The film was inspired by her mother’s difficult life; in 2001, Tlatli told the Guardian she “was riven with guilt … It was so insupportable, exhausting, suffocating.” Tlatli told the Guardian: “Traditionally in the Arab film world, a girl works in continuity or is an editor. I had never thought of making films.” In her next film, released in 2000, Tlatli dealt with not dissimilar material about relations between the sexes. The Season of Men is about a community on the Tunisian island of Djerba whose males spend most of the year away working, and return only for a month. The Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw called it “a beautifully lucid, compassionate film [and] a powerful and deeply engaging family drama”. Like Silences of the Palace, The Season of Men found much favour on the international film circuit, winning a number of awards. Tlatli was born in 1947 in Sidi Bou Said and studied film editing in Paris, before returning to Tunisia in 1972 to work as an editor. She completed a third feature, Nadia et Sarra, in 2004, starring Palestinian actor-director Hiam Abbass. In 2011, Tlatli was appointed minister for culture in the transitional government after the Tunisian revolution. •This article was amended on 9 February to correct the assertion that Tlatli was the first female Arab film-maker to direct a feature film.
Willy’s Wonderland review – Nicolas Cage cleans up in gory horror story	There will be sniggering once word gets out about this ridiculous horror film featuring a former kids’ birthday venue/game arcade occupied by evil, life-size animatronic puppets. However, to its credit, the film doesn’t take itself in the slightest bit seriously, because with a premise like that, really how could it? Especially when it has Nicolas Cage, uncharacteristically silent in a dialogue-free role, starring as a bad-ass drifter tricked into spending a night cleaning the haunted premises but proving to be a worthy opponent of the malevolent mechanical creatures. A posse of pesky, academically challenged kids are on hand to be picked off one by one by the bestiary of broken toys, whose leader takes the shape of a sinister weasel named Willy. The great character actor Beth Grant (Mrs Sometimes I Doubt Your Commitment to Sparkle Motion in Donnie Darko) plays the local sheriff who gets to give the big explication monologue about the building’s history, real estate deals and satanic possession. Casting a deep intertextual shadow over proceedings is the spirit of Chuck E Cheese, the string of franchised restaurants featuring oversized mechanical puppets founded in the US in the early 80s that scarred the psyches of people such as Willy’s Wonderland director Kevin Lewis. The parody versions of the songs here are pretty funny, as is Cage’s solemn devotion to his job, down to his insistence that he takes a pinball game break at intervals throughout the film. There’s also something weirdly satisfying about watching him clean the grime off the restaurant, like one of those reality-TV shows in which middle-aged ladies with rubber gloves scrub the homes of hoarders, but with added demons. • Willy’s Wonderland is available on digital platforms from 12 February.
Anti-Life review – ropey Alien-lite romp with Bruce Willis	It’s the year 2242 and Bruce Willis is still an ageing tough guy who’s kicking butt. That’s the alarming prospect raised by this ropey low-budget sci-fi set aboard a spacecraft carrying 300,000 people from dying Earth to life on a new planet. The plot centres on a parasitic alien chomping its way through the crew hired to keep the vessel ticking over while the passengers cryogenically sleep out the six-month journey. And the film-makers, having borrowed the storyline from Alien, also go for the same blue-collar, boilersuit-wearing, truckers-in-space realism. Willis growls a few lines, half-arses a catchphrase or two and points a gun. The film’s actual lead character is played by Cody Kearsley: Noah, a janitor on this spacecraft, which is the last to leave Earth for the new colony. His heavily pregnant girlfriend is a passenger. (Weirdly, no one seems worried about cryogenically deep-freezing her unborn baby.) Willis plays his hard-drinking boss Clay, though it’s a stretch to call what he does here acting. Security on board is tight following bomb threats from rebels who believe that, having screwed up one planet, humanity don’t deserve another spin of the wheel. It’s a briefly interesting idea, this group of militants trying to stop the spread of parasite humans into outer space, but instead Anti-Life feeds off sci-fi movies past. Enter an alien organism that first appears on screen as a glistening blur accompanied by scuttering on the soundtrack. I’m not sure if it’s still possible after so many Alien copycats to make the spectacle of an alien lifeform exploding out of a human host genuinely scary – and definitely not with the silly effects here. It’s called Anti-Life but it’s definitely not pro film. • Available from 12 February on digital platforms.
Dragon Rider review – starry family animation seeks fire	Not to be mistaken for the Dreamworks film How to Train Your Dragon franchise, here is a reasonably entertaining German family animation based on the 1997 bestseller by children’s author Cornelia Funke. It’s a great-looking film, energetically voiced in English by an A-team of British actors, but seriously let down by unexciting storytelling. Little children, though, may connect to the environmental message. Once upon a time, dragons and humans coexisted in harmony until humans hunted dragons close to extinction. Now the dragons live hidden deep in the rainforest, but deforestation is bringing their old foe ever closer. Among the dragons is young Firedrake (voiced by Thomas Brodie-Sangster), who has an embarrassing problem: he can’t breathe fire. Whenever he tries, only little fart-puffs of smoke come out. To prove his worth, he sets off to find a mythical utopia in the Himalayas, a place where dragons are said to live in peace and safety. Firedrake’s sidekick is feisty chipmunk Sorrell (Felicity Jones), and the pair set off on a predictable quest to find the mythical rim. Not far behind them is villain Nettlebrand, a manmade metal dragon (wonderfully voiced by Patrick Stewart with a sneer of superiority). En route they pick up homeless human teenager Ben (Freddie Highmore), who pretends to be a dragon rider. And here, jarringly, the film-makers drop in a winking reference to their rival franchise: when Firedrake crash-lands into the human city, there is the premiere of film called How to Tame Your Dragon. This movie doesn’t match the first couple of Train Your Dragon films for imagination. Still, it’s got a gag that would never make it into a Hollywood family movie: the first time the kid Ben meets Firedrake, he peers underneath the dragon and asks bemusedly: “You are a male dragon, aren’t you?” • Released on 12 February on Sky Cinema.
School's Out Forever review – gloriously gory adaptation of YA sci-fi horror	Adapted from a trilogy of young adult books by Scott K Andrews, that forms part of the “shared world” Afterblight Chronicles series, this gory British boys’ school-set sci-fi posits a deadly virus that swiftly kills almost everyone everywhere except those with a particular blood type. If The Lord of the Flies crossed with The Road and a dash of Tom Brown’s School Days sounds like your bag of blood, than this ruthless romp will be a kick in the head. Director Oliver Milburn, who has made a bunch of horror-themed shorts and one feature (The Harsh Light of Day), has a real knack for staging action and coaxing sincere, punchy performances from his mostly young cast. Much of the story is seen through the eyes of Lee (Oscar Kennedy, actually 22 but babyfaced enough to pass for a teenager), one of the few scholarship boys at St Mark’s, a posh all-male school deep in the English countryside. Busted by the headmaster (Anthony Head, forever Giles from Buffy the Vampire Slayer) for a silly prank, he gets expelled on the same day the UK government starts talking about closing the border to prevent the spread of a deadly virus. Naturally, this fictional UK being true to form, it is already too late; when Lee is left alone he has nowhere else to go but back to St Mark’s. There he finds a few survivors, including his best buddy Mac (Liam Lau Fernandez), a matron not much older than the boys (Jasmine Blackborow) and a few teachers. The survivors start scavenging for food but before long they run afoul of the townies from the well-heeled suburb nearby. Milburn’s screenplay has a streak of dry wit but it never goes for cheap laughs. Instead, it’s a surprisingly bleak and merciless work, judiciously killing off both sympathetic and unlikable characters, including some of the kids and even an unfortunate pet, a line most films are too timid to cross but one that is entirely plausible given the circumstances. Expect more instalments in the franchise if this one takes off. • Available from 15 February on digital platforms.
Broil review – Jonathan Lipnicki serves up murder in fantasy thriller	Any Gen Xers happy to see one more pop culture touchstone bulldozed will appreciate this ambitious but overstuffed fantasy thriller in which Jerry Maguire’s gorgeous poppet Jonathan Lipnicki appears as a murderous autistic chef with an encyclopaedic knowledge of toxins. He plays Sydney, a short-order cook hired by two scions of the fearsome Sinclair clan to dispatch the patriarch August (Timothy V Murphy) at a family dinner. This monster, with a caustic Ulster accent and a grin like a dagger flash, has cut a deal with his children to take custody of his granddaughter Chance (Avery Konrad) so he can inculcate her into the full extent of her powers. The Sinclairs must be invited over the threshold, need daily transfusions of human blood, and sprout tumours after being exposed to too much daylight – so are they vampires? An “oversimplification,” according to Sydney. Beginning with Chance at home and being expelled from school, director Edward Drake tries to ground Broil’s mythology in a more original, domestic setting. But his preamble is off-puttingly cumbersome, full of insinuated but vague backstory that becomes even harder to navigate when the film drops into nested flashbacks and flashforwards to usher in the murder plot. Drake works hard stylistically, but his reagents – Twilight-style young adult and high-gothic horror – threaten never to mix. Eventually, the dinner gives the narrative some focus. From the head of the table, August ferrets out his poisoners and – turning the dial up on a performance that already began close to 10 – organises a set of sadistic after-dinner games in revenge. The power games and grandstanding far more cleanly impart the family’s place within the dark metaphysical backdrop Drake had been awkwardly pinning up behind them. His flair for maintaining a rancorous grand-guignol atmosphere – without resorting to too much gore – hints at a promising future in genre cinema, provided he can keep things simple. • Released on 15 February on digital formats.
Sator review – deeply creepy cabin-in-the-woods horror	This extremely low-budget horror film is a lot like a bunch of movies you know – particularly The Blair Witch Project and The Witch, as well as the experimental cinema of Kenneth Anger – but also not quite like anything else. It’s a kind of uniqueness to be treasured, although genre fans may feel frustrated with how slowly the plot reveals itself, its degraded visual style, and its wilful obliqueness. Shot mostly in a snowy forest and a log cabin that writer-director Jordan Graham built himself (he did every job on the film, apart from acting), the film mixes staged scenes with found material. It’s performed mostly by actors but also by Graham’s grandmother June Peterson, who appears to have dementia in real life and whose belief in a supernatural being called Sator who watches over her forms the seed around which Graham has grown the story. Gabriel Nicholson plays June’s withdrawn fictional grandson Adam, who is seemingly disturbed by events long ago; he now lives in the cabin. His obsession with “deer” in the woods is revealed to be a haunting by creepy-looking horned creature-y things that have a way of turning up in a jump cut. Adam’s siblings check up on him, but it becomes clear that this is one screwed-up family. Mixing black and white, low-resolution footage with more colourful material creates a bricolage-like effect that keeps wrong-footing the viewer. Graham uses darkness and a very sparse score/soundscape to create a truly disturbing work that relies not so much on gore as the uncanny in its most potent form: stillness, pools of darkness and just-visible figures. I’ve watched dozens of films at home since lockdown, and this is one of the few I wish I could have seen in a blacked-out cinema. • Sator is available on digital platforms from 15 February.
Pvt Chat review – refreshingly grownup take on virtual sex	In a 2016 Vanity Fair article, Nancy Jo Sales wrote about prostitution going mainstream, describing a new economy of young people selling their bodies to pay off student loans or just to get by in the tough economic climate. On the same theme, Ben Hozie makes his feature debut with this semi-insightful, uncomfortably funny indie drama about a man who becomes obsessed with an online sex worker. It’s a film with a slackerish mumblecore vibe, and Hozie is refreshingly grown up about sex. But it’s hard to see how his film adds much to the conversation about intimacy in the internet age. It’s set in the self-consciously hip New York art scene where Jack (Peter Vack) calls himself a professional gambler; though watching him max out his credit cards playing internet blackjack it’s obvious that he’s hooked. His other addiction is cam-girls – women who perform sex acts in front of a webcam for money. Jack spends a fortune tipping his favourite, dominatrix Scarlet (Julia Fox); she calls him her slave and in a funny-excruciating scene virtually stubs her cigarette out on his tongue. What’s clever about the script is that Jack isn’t some “incel” creep who can’t function in the real world. He’s a bit lost, but he’s funny and good-looking (though pallid from all that screen time). An artist ex-girlfriend wants to sleep with him – sex in the real world. But Jack prefers it virtually. About halfway in the perspective flips to Scarlet, played with super-sexy charisma by Fox (who was Adam Sandler’s girlfriend in Uncut Gems and worked as a dominatrix in real life). There is no question of slut-shaming Scarlet – being a sex worker is her choice. But she’s a disappointing character: empty-headed and, away from the webcam, a doormat to her slimy playwright boyfriend. This film is not nearly so edgy as it thinks it is. • Pvt Chat is available on digital platforms from 12 February.
Shia LaBeouf's legal team denies abuse claims by ex-girlfriend FKA twigs	American actor Shia LaBeouf’s legal team has denied allegations of sexual battery and assault made by his former girlfriend, British musician FKA twigs, in a civil lawsuit last year. LaBeouf’s attorney said in a court filing that the actor “denies generally and specifically each and every allegation” in the complaint. The court document, filed on 5 February and made available to Reuters on Thursday, also states that the singer’s allegation of sexual battery was invalid “because none of the acts alleged were based on sex.” The civil lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles superior court in December under her real name Tahliah Barnett, sought unspecified damages for alleged sexual battery, assault and emotional distress. Barnett also accused LaBeouf of emotional abuse during their year-long relationship in 2019. The lawsuit states that in February 2019 Barnett was a passenger in a vehicle that LaBeouf was driving recklessly, and that he removed his seatbelt and threatened to crash unless she said she loved him. The pair had taken a trip to the desert outside Los Angeles, during which, Barnett alleged, LaBeouf once woke her up in the middle of the night by choking her. LaBeouf, 34, a former child star, is currently undergoing unspecified in-patient treatment, according to a source close to the actor. He had previously issued a general statement apologizing for hurting those around him and citing a history of alcoholism and aggression. In an interview with the New York Times, Barnett, 32, characterised her experience with LaBeouf as “the worst thing I’ve ever been through in the whole of my life” and said she wanted to raise awareness of “the tactics that abusers use to control you and take away your agency”. Responding to detailed allegations about his conduct, LaBeouf told the Times that “many of these allegations are not true” but that he owed Barnett and Karolyn Pho, another woman whose claims feature in the lawsuit, “the opportunity to air their statements publicly and [for me to] accept accountability for those things I have done”. Barnett’s attorney said in a statement on Thursday that LaBeouf’s “legal tact and recovery plan, while not surprising, are poorly misguided self-help strategies.”
Slalom review – a teenage skier's hopes go downhill in bone-chilling abuse drama	Fifteen-year-old Lyz (Noée Abita) is on course to become a champion skier. A gifted athlete, she also has the grit, fearlessness and youthful arrogance necessary to rise through the ranks at a training programme in the Alps. In this tense, bone-chilling first feature, French writer-director Charlène Favier looks at how teenage girls are often punished for that boldness. Abita plays Lyz with an air of invincibility that soon curdles into powerlessness as her coach, Fred (Jérémie Renier), begins to scrutinise and prey on her vulnerabilities. He comments on her changing body, pinching her stomach and lecturing her about how “periods are beautiful”. But for every inappropriate remark, there’s welcome praise too. With her mother (Muriel Combeau) off in Marseilles and distracted by a new boyfriend, and her friends more interested in partying, perfectionist Lyz can’t help but crave adult acknowledgment. It’s a vicious cycle: Lyz trains harder, and so Fred intervenes further, treating each win as an invitation to cross another boundary. Favier is smart on the mechanics of abuse, and the sobering inevitability of her heroine’s downhill skid. • On Curzon Home Cinema
Letter: Rémy Julienne obituary	I worked on many commercials with Rémy Julienne (obituary, 4 February). He “acted” in so many films that he deserved a special Oscar. When actors were not allowed to take part in dangerous driving scenes, he was always the first to step up. “Any fool can crash a car – the trick is to walk away after,” he said. His brilliant team organised for me a seven-car crash on a rain-soaked road (for a commercial for Uniroyal rain tyres directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud). Shot with six cameras, it was perfect – Cut! – then, one hour later, Rémy told me that all the cars were repaired and they were ready for a second take. That was the sort of organisation that made Rémy’s L’Equipe team so valuable to film directors all over the world.
Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar review – Wiig and Mumolo laughing all the way to the beach	This fun and diverting comedy from work wives Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo, who co-wrote 2011’s Bridesmaids, has a silly premise. After being made redundant, culotte-wearing besties Barb (Mumolo) and Star (Wiig) use their severance pay to escape their midwestern hometown for a holiday at the Palm Vista Hotel in Florida. It’s a “middle-aged paradise”, and so Edgar (Jamie Dornan), the young Irish heartthrob they meet at the bar, sticks out like a sore thumb. He’s there on business, involved in a sinister plot involving genetically modified mosquitos. The sci-fi stuff is tedious, but Wiig and Mumolo are bawdy and brilliant as ever, their effortless chemistry bolstered by years of collaboration. As for Dornan, a notably sombre and wooden screen presence in the Fifty Shades of Grey movies, he is required to prance about a sandy beach, participate in several musical numbers and even shake a pair of maracas. He’s an interesting, amusing casting choice, genuinely endearing here as a supervillain’s accomplice and wannabe boyfriend. Comedy, it seems, is a less awkward fit. Available on multiple VOD platforms
Music review – Sia's tone-deaf treatment of autism	For many years, Australian pop star Sia has hidden behind a fringe that covers her eyes. Using actors instead of starring in her own music videos, she has preferred not to centre herself. Yet her directorial debut appears to draw from her own experiences with addiction; its protagonist Zu (a near-bald Kate Hudson) is a recovering alcoholic. This is confusing, given that the film’s title refers to her non-speaking, neurodivergent younger sister Music (Maddie Ziegler), whose main purpose is to absolve Zu from her troubled past. Ziegler, who appeared on the reality TV show Dance Moms, and features in some of Sia’s best-known videos (including Chandelier and Elastic Heart), is not herself on the autistic spectrum. It’s a problem, especially given the cartoonishness of her portrayal, which sees her gurning, grimacing and mumbling through her scenes. Music uses an augmentative and alternative communication device to translate rudimentary expressions such as “I am happy” and “I am sad”. Her interior world is just as simplistic, conveyed via goofy musical interludes rendered in childlike primary colours and abstract shapes. The lyrics, jaunty platitudes about Music’s “magic mind” and failing body, are offensive too. These self-consciously upbeat moments clash horribly with the wider redemption narrative. Available on multiple VOD platforms from 15 February
The Kiosk review – fond farewell to a Parisian newsstand	In its unassuming way, this sparky documentary captures an aspect of modern Paris life at the very moment that it’s becoming obsolete: almost a fragment of the belle époque. Alexandra Pianelli is an artist and film-maker who is working shifts at a newspaper kiosk in Paris, which is run by her mum and which was once run by her grandparents and great-grandparents before that. With a headcam, she films the regular customers who come in to buy their papers and magazines and generally chat and flirt with Pianelli – her camera records their faces, and she also sketches them and creates witty little models and stop-motion animation sequences to show what life is like in her kiosk. Things are tough. A distribution strike reduces the number of papers they have to sell but their overheads remain the same. An old-fashioned clippings research agency goes bust owing them €30,000, which they will never see. A demo on the street results in better sales one day, but their eyes are stinging from the teargas. Unlike British cornershops selling papers, the kiosk can’t diversify into fruit, veg and convenience-store sandwiches. And, of course, most importantly, the internet is killing print – the kiosk’s bread and butter. Pianelli’s mum is seriously considering retirement and letting the kiosk be dismantled (and we are entitled to suspect that the film-maker knew perfectly well from the outset that this retirement is a certainty, and would provide her with a bittersweet ending). We in fact only glimpse Pianelli herself a couple of times – but her headcam is clearly an icebreaker for the regulars who cheerfully play up, now that they know what she is doing. This is a very sweet, charming film and there is something high-minded and even innocent about this little island of print journalism. • The Kiosk is released on 19 February on True Story.
Digger review – family tensions are unearthed in slow-burn Greek drama	Its plot featuring a giant mining corporation known as “the monster” tearing up the landscape and causing bitter division among the hard-drinking local populace, this handsomely shot drama could be taking place in rust-belt America. But this is backwoods Greece, where forest rancher Nikitas (Vangelis Mourikis), first seen fending off a landslide caused by the miners’ activities, is fighting a running battle to keep them from despoiling the haven he loves. A motorbike throttle at midnight announces the arrival of his estranged son Johnny (Argyris Pandazaras), whose need to claim his inheritance adds to the pressure on Nikitas to ship out. With this father-son conflict, and a liking for contemporary imagery like Johnny’s motocross track to liven up the classicism, director Georgis Grigorakis in his feature debut makes a claim on the same kind of romantic-realist territory as Jacques Audiard. Father and son are forced to cohabit in Nikitas’s forest cabin; their feuding starts small – he tries to make Johnny wear slippers inside – but gradually becomes inflamed by past grievances. Mourikis, looking like a skulking Leonard Cohen, coolly underplays the resentment and regrets until they explode at the corporate lackeys, like when they cut down his walnut tree. It’s a shame that, as it ramps up, this generational tension isn’t dramatised with the sharpness it might have been. Johnny is more thinly drawn, leaving Digger over-reliant on Nikitas’s selfish idealism – and some occasionally on-the-nose scenes revolving around it. Luckily, Grigorakis’ breakdown of the town’s factions is more subtle. And he and cinematographer Giorgos Karvelas not only have an eye for striking visuals, but they know how to use them in amplifying counterpoint: the forest dells are filmed with the protective intimacy Nikitas feels for them, as against the shock and awe of the mining excavator’s behemoth teeth. A bracing backdrop for a world-weary but engaging film. Released on 16 February on Mubi.
What Lies Below review – a dire coming-of-age horror with a fishy twist	You might find enough giggles in this stupendously silly coming-of-age horror to keep yourself amused. But, honestly, it’s not really funny enough to be enjoyably bad – even with a bizarro erotic storyline involving humans and fish. It stars Ema Horvath (who, it’s fair to say, looks pretty uncomfortable) as 16-year-old Liberty, back from summer camp to find that her mum, Michelle (Mena Suvari), has installed a young new boyfriend in their home. He is superhunk John, an aquatic geneticist played by Trey Tucker, whose wooden acting I doubt would make the grade in a porn film. Embarrassingly, Liberty can’t hide the fact that she has a massive crush on John. Worse, he creepily stares at her while making out with her mum in the kitchen – and walks around the house naked. Director Braden R Duemmler creates zero tension in these moments. Is there an erotic frisson between Liberty and John? Or does his behaviour amount to grooming? Through all of this, mum Michelle is clueless and poor Suvari has nothing to do but drool over John, and pant terrible cougar-ish lines like: “I’m riding him constantly.” As it happens, the question about which lucky lady has the keys to John’s heart melts away when he is seen – a la Troy McClure – pervily eyeing up specimens in the tank in the basement; fish are his one true love. “You’re kind of a weird dude,” says Liberty, underplaying the freaky plot twist. To prepare you for that, there’s a mad scene in which Liberty gets her period in a rowing boat with John – who leans over and licks the blood, a peculiar quiver passing over his face. The denouement when it comes is meant to be shriek of pure sci-fi horror; but really, you’d find better entertainment – and more energetic acting – watching a fish tank. • Released on 22 February on digital platforms.
White Colour Black review – Dudley O’Shaughnessy is one to watch	British-Nigerian director Joseph Adesunloye’s feature debut – made in 2016 but only now seeing the light of day – is the story of a London photographer travelling to Senegal for his father’s funeral. It’s a drifting movie, not entirely successful but grounded by the undeniable screen presence of boxer turned model turned actor Dudley O’Shaughnessy. (He was in the recent season of Top Boy; in his modelling days he appeared opposite Rihanna in the video for We Found Love.) Here he plays Leke, a fashion photographer living the dream in Hackney; home is a loft-style flat overlooking the city and Leke is about to open a major show in China. The film begins with a couple of fake-feeling gallery scenes, everyone head-to-toe in black and air-kissing with extravagant mwah-mwahs (this is the art world recognisable from other movies rather than real life). Despite his success, Leke seems detached from his life in London. He is also ignoring telephone messages from Senegal, where his father is seriously ill. When the inevitable call comes – his dad has died – Leke flies to Dakar. A family friend has arranged for a taxi driver to be his guide. “What do you speak? French? Wolof?” Leke shakes his head no. “Mon ami,” says the guy. “Tu est perdu. You are really, really lost.” Leke zones out, staring out of the taxi window. But Dakar switches him on; he photographs everything around him and starts seeing beautiful Badewa (Yrsa Daley-Ward). Then, reluctantly, he makes the journey to his dad’s village. Someone alludes to a family rift that is never explained – and the script continues in the same vein, revealing nothing about Leke, his childhood or sense of identity. That reticence is frustrating. But O’Shaughnessy – three parts swagger, two parts tenderness – pulls it along nicely. He’s a talent to watch. • Released on 19 February on Curzon Home Cinema.
Ashes in the Snow review – heartfelt but brutal YA gulag drama	Here’s a soapy, semi-harrowing wartime drama based on Ruta Sepetys’s bestselling YA novel Between Shades of Gray, about a teenage girl deported to a Soviet gulag. The book was written for teenagers but discovered by adults; the issue for the movie seems to be uncertainty about which audience is the target. It’s a sometimes hard-hitting, always heartfelt film – and star Bel Powley is an actor with an umami-style knack for adding depth to any film she’s in. But cynical viewers over 17 may find themselves rolling their eyes at snogs grabbed outside prison huts. We start in Lithuania in 1941. Powley is 16-year-old Lina, a promising artist whose father, a university professor, is suspected of working against the Soviets. One night the entire family is arrested; Lina, her mum and little brother are loaded onto a cattle car and transported to a prison camp in Siberia. The commander, icily cruel Komarov (Peter Franzén), sentences them to hard labour in unbearable conditions – digging beetroot out of frozen mud day after day with their bare hands. The characters speak mostly English, though Russian lines are in Russian. There’s no other way around the language problem I suppose, but it is distracting; you can never quite forget you’re watching actors in pretend-dirty clothes talking English with eastern European accents. The film’s pace flags a fair amount, but director Marius A Markevicius sensitively shows Lina’s humiliation and horror as a teenager in the camp. Arriving after weeks on a cramped train with no toilets or water, the prisoners are ordered to strip naked for washing. Lina is mortified by the prospect of getting undressed in public, especially since the boy she likes (Jonah Hauer-King), is standing nearby – in true YA style, atrocity and tragedy can only ever be a backdrop to an epic love story. Though to be fair, Markevicius doesn’t flinch from brutality: upsetting scenes showing prisoners being arbitrarily shot dead and an attempted rape scene more than earn the 15 certificate. A war drama with stabilisers. • Released on 19 February on Amazon Prime Video.
Shook review – stalk-and-slash horror with social media angle	Shook opens with a smart satirical visual gag. It reveals the cast of characters, a bunch of female online influencers who pimp out various products, arriving at a swanky event, complete with popping flashbulbs. An edit from another angle shows not all is as it seems, which pretty much sets the tone for the rest of the film: a thriller in the stalk-and-slash tradition but one that keeps pulling the rug out from under the viewer’s expectations. After the first gory bit of wrong-footing (literally, it involves a shoe as weapon), blonde beauty specialist Mia (Daisye Tutor) emerges as the main protagonist. After she arrives at her family home in the suburbs to watch cute lapdog Chico for her sister Nicole (Emily Goss) for a few days, it gradually becomes clear that Mia and Nicole’s mother died not so long ago, and that the two sisters have a rancorous relationship, mostly because passive-aggressive Nicole resents flighty, irresponsible Mia for not helping out more when their mother was dying. Seemingly surgically attached to her smartphone, Mia streams updates to her fans, and checks in with other friends across town who keep asking her to come over and party with them. But then the neighbour from across the street (Grant Rosenmeyer) reaches out via text and call, and it becomes clear that he might be a suspect in a string of dog and people murders in the area. Once the danger is established, writer-director Jennifer Harrington gets to work deploying jump scares and reveals that are strictly off-the-shelf generic scary stuff. What makes this a little more interesting is the whole social media/home-surveillance angle, which creates certain interesting challenges to demonstrate what’s going on in different places. Harrington uses simple projections on the scenery to show what’s happening in Mia’s phone; later, there are Zoom-style split-screens with multiple characters watching numbly as horror unfolds. It’s all very 2021, and you can’t help wondering how it will age, but as a launching pad for the director and her cast, it’s a very serviceable platform. Tutor is particularly good at looking terrified, and manages to make the vapid, narcissistic Mia just sympathetic enough that you don’t necessarily want to see her, or cute widdle Chico, get killed. • Released on 18 February on Shudder.
The Owners review – OAP burglars get more than they bargained for	This nifty thriller, set mostly in a grand manor house deep in the British countryside, has an impressively evil streak and a clever twist or two that perhaps are not hard to see coming if you’re experienced in the genre. Even so, director Julius Berg, who has worked mostly in French TV and makes his feature debut here, has a knack for ratcheting up suspense and finessing the technicalities in order to maximise the creepiness. For example, the sound design (by Ben Baird) is outstanding, an almost palpable entity that shimmers with synthesiser drones and distorted noises generated by the plot. Elsewhere, when the violence and anxiety reaches its zenith, the film switches aspect ratio to a boxy, nearly square format, heightening the claustrophobia; it’s the sort of thing you might not notice at first but affects the viewing experience in subtle ways. The idea is that three local no-hopers with varying degrees of criminal aspiration plan on burgling the home of Dr Richard and Mrs Ellen Huggins (Sylvester McCoy and Rita Tushingham), a cuddly pair of old dears. Chunky dimwit Terry (Andrew Ellis), the son of the Huggins’s cleaner, has heard they’ve got a huge stash of cash and valuables in the house, and has tipped off his harder, meaner friend Nathan (Ian Kenny) – who has brought along even nastier Gaz (Jake Curran, sporting a truly evil mullet and white dreadlock hairdo). But the sudden appearance of Nathan’s girlfriend, Mary (Maisie Williams), annoyed because Nathan has taken her car and she needs to get to work, throws the plan off kilter, as does the unexpected return of the owners of the property. The young cast are pretty good, but seasoned players McCoy and Tushingham are the real scene stealers, especially Tushingham with those still-wondrous marble blue eyes, just as mesmerising as they were back in the day when she was a British It girl, starring in A Taste of Honey and The Knack … and How to Get It. • Available from 22 February on digital platforms.
Butchers review – worn-out horror tropes salvaged by good performances	Here is another one of those horror flicks where young people on holiday in rural places are terrorised by crazed degenerates. Even if Butchers is more preoccupied with paying homage to its slasher ancestors than carving out its own turf, the opening scene is atmospheric enough. Against the icy canvas of a snow-covered graveyard, two brothers, Owen (Simon Phillips) and Oswald (Michael Swatton), are burying their mother: the occasion is solemn as Owen delivers a half-hearted two-sentence eulogy. But things kick off when they glimpse a car breaking down, and straight away we are into gore as the brothers ambush and brutally terrorise their first victims. Unfortunately, Butchers struggles to keep up this momentum after the film cuts to two 20-something couples speeding through this cursed terrain. (The brothers are not professional butchers but rather hobbyists with a makeshift slaughterhouse.) These young city folks are eminently dislikable – two of them are hooking up and cheating on their respective partners – yet none of these details helps flesh them out, nor encourage much sympathy at their gory demise. Backwoods killers are a common enough device, but Butchers takes the odd decision to have its Canadian killers speak with a southern drawl à la Texas Chainsaw Massacre, an intentional incongruity that doesn’t really work. Heavy-handed sound effects don’t help, either. Nevertheless, despite the meandering script, it’s Phillips’ performance that keeps the film’s pulse going. His Owen is exhilaratingly unpredictable, alternating between moments of meticulous villainy and sheer lunacy – one moment he will be refitting a spooky music box while eyeing his oblivious prey, next he will be whacking his victim bloodily, channelling a kind of biblical righteousness that makes him slippery, fascinating and, most importantly, terrifying to watch. Despite Phillips’ cleaver-wielding swagger, however, Butchers is pretty much dead meat, an amalgam of worn-out tropes unsuccessfully zombified to life. • Released on 22 February on digital platforms.
Archenemy review – wacky fight for justice in parallel universes	Small, imperfectly formed but quite entertaining all the same, this wacky sci-fi-adjacent feature stars Joe Manganiello (from the Magic Mike movies and, let’s not forget, Smurfs: The Lost Village) as an intense, homeless man with a cut torso who calls himself Max Fist. Max has a taste for hooch and crystal meth but also claims to be a super powerful fighter for justice from a parallel universe – a realm that just so happens to be accessible through an abandoned shopping mall in grotty Edge City where the action is set. While all that unfolds in a real enough looking US city, shot on film stock, the stories Max narrates about his previous life in the other universe are illustrated with some groovy looking animation and a mix of stylised drawings and computer renderings, mostly in a hypersaturated palette of electric blue and magenta pink. This colour scheme persists throughout, cropping up in the live-action sequences, too, giving the whole film a pop art, candy-coloured artificiality that’s pleasingly retro. The film’s other heroes, a teenager named Hamster (Skylan Brooks) and his tough older sister Indigo (Zolee Griggs) feel drawn very much from a 21st-century gallery of archetypes, what with Hamster aspiring to make it big as an influencer online while Indigo is breaking through the glass ceiling as a female drug dealer, working for a local thug known only as the Manager (Glenn Howerton, hamming it up amusingly). Writer-director Adam Egypt Mortimer moves seamlessly between the two registers, although, in truth, the last act feels breathless and rushed. Mumblecore star Amy Seimetz (Upstream Color) makes it all worthwhile with a turn that doesn’t get that much screen time but leaves a huge impression. • Released on 22 February on digital platforms.
Pelé review – valedictory tribute to Brazilian football great	Here’s a slightly more upscale contribution to the deluge of feature-length football documentaries that have flooded our screens in the last few years. Pelé is the apex talent who underpinned Brazil’s rise to unquenchable glory in the 1960s, culminating in the epic 1970 victory over Italy in the World Cup final – itself crowned by the endlessly replayed Carlos Alberto goal set up by Pelé’s cute lay-off: the cherry on the icing of the cake of football’s golden age. In truth, Pelé is’s stardom was partly founded on his smiley, boy-next-door persona and he is a fundamentally undramatic figure – certainly compared to the chaotic lord-of-misrule that was Diego Maradona, his only serious rival in the greatest-of-all-time stakes. Consequently, this admiring profile is considerably more sedate than Asif Kapadia’s rollicking biography of Maradona, though benefiting from an extensive interview with Pelé, who is now unable to walk without assistance. While Pelé’s footballing feats – inspiring Brazil to three World Cup wins, spending almost his entire career knocking in more than 1,000 goals for the same small Brazilian club, a brief foray to New York in the mid-70s – may seem to belong to ancient history, there’s a comfort-blanket familiarity about running through them once again. Where this film does turn up interesting material is by filling in the context of Brazil’s turbulent history in the 60s and highlighting Pelé’s participation in legitimising the military coup. Pelé maintains his ingenuous stance was entirely non-political, but there is a degree of bitterness on show from contemporaries who didn’t have his celebrity privilege. And it’s eye-opening to see the tensions preceding the 1970 World Cup, given Brazil’s triumph, seemed pre-ordained. But Pelé still possesses plenty of untarnished lustre as, arguably, the world’s first black sporting superstar, and the gold standard for footballing achievement for decades. (The Viagra ads he did at the turn of the millennium somehow don’t get a mention.) This valedictory film allows sober recognition for all that he did. • Available from 23 February on Netflix.
Blush review – midlife crisis drama leaves you discontent and unfulfilled 	As the lead turn in this burb-midlife crisis dramedy, Wendi McLendon-Covey repeatedly does a facial expression which can best be called stunned-discontentment-and-incredulity. It is, if nothing else, appropriate for the very eventful script from writer-director Debra Eisenstadt, that packs in loads of ideas and situations, and brings us to a series of contrived seriocomic crises, after which the dramatic temperature is reset to normal in the succeeding scene. At one stage McLendon-Covey’s character gets hit by a car, and simply limps away with the same satirically grumpy face and a bruise to show for it. It’s not totally clear if the surreal effect is intentional. McLendon-Covey plays Cathy, a woman who is bored and unfulfilled in her uptight marriage to Matthew (Steve Little, the dorky teacher Stevie Janowski from TV’s Eastbound &amp; Down) and anxious about her relationship with her teen daughter Tara – a very good performance from Kate Alberts. When she goes cat sitting for her querulous sister Gail (Catherine Curtin), Cathy finds herself fascinated by Gail’s dodgy neighbours: substance abuser Gemma Jean (Christine Woods), her husband Paul (Graham Sibley) and their teen son Xander (Max Burkholder). Gemma Jean shares inappropriately with Cathy, and both Paul and Xander seem attracted to her. Blush plays out along the classic American Beauty lines: menopausal sexual adventure for the grownups in ironic parallel with a disruptive emotional awakening for the teens a generation below. Tara even does an outrageously sexy group dance on the high-school stage which is taken straight from the Oscar-winning film. Matthew seems entirely enraptured by this, incidentally – odd, considering how cross he is later about Tara’s apparent relationship with a much older boy. In the end, this movie doesn’t really go anywhere or do anything. • Released on 22 February on digital platforms.
The Sinners review – inept teen horror dead on arrival	Several past-it tropes from 1990s and 00s teen horror films strut the corridors of high school once more in this debut by director Courtney Paige. In a devoutly Christian small town, local preacher’s daughter Grace Carver (Kaitlyn Bernard) rebels against her conservative community by wearing scarlet lipstick and conducting a strenuously titillating affair with her BFF (very Cruel Intentions). The actual scandal though is her cultish clique, the Sins (very The Craft), founded with six of her naughtiest classmates. The group is so named because each member is reputed to embody a different one of the seven cardinal vices. Flirtatious Grace is Lust, rich girl Katie is Greed and so on. When “Pride”, AKA Aubrey (Brenna Llewellyn), is perceived to have transgressed their code – by recording her innermost thoughts in a leather-bound journal (very Mean Girls) – Grace and her acolytes commence a ruthless bullying campaign that culminates in Aubrey’s disappearance on the edge of the woods. The town’s well-meaning but bumbling sheriff, Fred Middleton (Aleks Paunovic), investigates (a nod to Scream’s Deputy Dewey), as a remorseful Grace scrambles to destroy any evidence of her involvement. Then the rest of the Sins start turning up dead, their corpses prettily accessorised with a single rose pressed between their lips. That would be enough to keep most girls quiet, but not Aubrey, whose verbose beyond-the-grave narration commits many sins against cinema’s first commandment of “show, don’t tell”. There is also one of those dastardly villains who, once unmasked, can’t resist putting off an escape to lay out their entire warped plan in detail. Even with such lengthy explanation, the characters’ motivations and plot twist doesn’t make much sense. At least The Sinners’ sexy-schoolgirl-corpse aesthetic – part Twin Peaks, part Ariana Grande music video – is too ineptly executed to truly offend. • Available from 22 February on digital platforms.
Rocks romps home at British independent film awards	The much-praised London-set teen drama Rocks has emerged as the lead winner of the British independent film awards (Bifas), which were announced on Thursday in a virtual ceremony hosted by actor Tom Felton. Rocks, directed by Sarah Gavron and produced by Faye Ward and Ameenah Ayub Allen, stars Bukky Bakray as a girl left to look after her brother when her mother abandons them; it won five awards including best British independent film, best supporting actress for Kosar Ali, best supporting actor for D’Angelou Osei Kissiedu and best casting. Ali also won the award for most promising newcomer. Bakray, however, was surprisingly beaten in the race for the best actress award by Wunmi Mosaku, who co-starred in the Netflix refugee horror His House, which won four Bifas. Remi Weekes, the film’s writer-director, took home the best director award, and the film also won best effects and best production design. Next in number of awards with three was The Father, a study of dementia starring Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins won best actor, and the film won best screenplay and best editing. The night was a personal triumph for Riz Ahmed, who – despite losing out as best actor for rap drama Mogul Mowgli – took home the debut screenwriter award for the same film (for which he was jointly credited with the film’s director, Bassam Tariq) as well as the best British short film award for The Long Goodbye which he co-created to accompany his acclaimed album of the same name.

Zappa review – under the skin of the wild man of American rock	This documentary about the hugely prolific Frank Zappa, directed by Alex “Bill Preston Esq” Winter, takes an unusually serious-minded approach to the celebrated wild man of 1960s and 70s American rock: ranging from his unusual childhood, to his ferocious work ethic, to his political-sphere interventions, this is a fruitful attempt to get under the skin of a figure who is renowned for lurking eccentrically at the music industry’s periphery. One thing it doesn’t focus much on is the music itself; perhaps the ongoing devotion of Zappa’s hardcore fans means there’s no compelling reason to introduce the work to a new generation. In Winter’s eyes, Zappa’s oddness was set early: the son of a chemical engineer who worked for an army poison gas lab, his musical interests were sparked by an album of experimental percussion by modernist composer Edgar Varèse (the exact quote: “the most frightening, evil, vile thing a human being could listen to; I couldn’t understand why people didn’t love it”); an early encounter with the law, which saw him ejected from the small-town studio he set up as a young man for supposedly agreeing to help make a “stag film”, set him on the way to embracing the counterculture in Los Angeles and later New York. The film is at pains to counter some of the more enduring Zappa myths: he was not some whacked-out hippy, avoided drugs, and worked with a focused dedication to realise his musical vision. The cost of this is spelled out: many of the musicians found him a distant presence, ready to ditch them once their purpose was served; his children had to pitch for his attention; and his wife Gail, who speaks here at length before her death in 2015, had to contend with Zappa’s well-known fondness for the groupie lifestyle and – to put it mildly – some unreconstructed views on women. Winter also devotes lengthy sequences to Zappa’s congressional testimony in opposition to labelling record lyrics, and his unlikely adoption as a cultural envoy by post-cold war Czechoslovakia. There’s perhaps a little too much telling us what a genius Zappa was without really letting us hear for ourselves; this perhaps also explains the stress laid on his “classical” compositions, as if to reinforce his serious-musician credentials. But there’s no denying Zappa’s personal charisma and devotion to his cause, nor his articulacy in its service. Winter has created a fascinating watch. • Available at Altitude.Film.
Bad Tales review – horribly compelling urban fairytale	There’s a diseased yellow cast to the photography here, a sawing anxiety in the score, which means that even a moment of joyous summer release – a water fight among children – is undermined by a lurking sense of unease. Bad Tales, the second feature film from Damiano and Fabio D’Innocenzo, is a slippery thing, an urban fairytale unfolding under cautionary storm clouds in a sweltering suburb of Rome. Three families, not friends exactly but neighbours in a state of churlish co-existence, are the focus of a story narrated by an unknown male. He claims that the tale comes from a girl’s diary, but seeds the possibility of untruths. There’s a trickle-down of toxicity in this disappointed backwater, which has as its source the men of the families. The children pick up on the resentment, the swaggering sexuality that bears a taint of aggrieved anger. What chance do these kids have? A pregnant teenager wears her parental unfitness with a mocking smirk; middle-school students Dennis and Alessia cling together as their father vents his unpredictable anger. And spindly Geremia struggles to talk to beautiful Viola, whose father discusses her academic mediocrity as if she weren’t present. Parental indifference is not attuned to the looming tragedy in this horribly compelling fable. Bad Tales is on Mubi
Zappa review – a maverick sensibility	Bill and Ted actor turned director Alex Winter brings a fan’s eye and a shared maverick sensibility to this suitably unruly documentary about rock musician and composer Frank Zappa. His music, it’s fair to say, is not for everyone, but the film succeeds in conveying the exhilarating connection felt by those who get it. Long-term Zappa collaborator Ruth Underwood plays the piano part of The Black Page, a piece described as being “the forefront of innovation in regard to rhythmic polymetric notation”. Her delighted smile when she nails it perfectly matches a photo of the same moment, on stage several decades previously, with Zappa beaming approval back at her. Winter had a lot to work with: Zappa kept an exhaustive archive of recordings and material, documenting every aspect of his wide-ranging career and frequently recalcitrant public persona. Key to the success of the film is the editing, a pinballing assault of free association, claymation and gleeful profanity, which goes some way towards recreating what it must have been like to spend time inside Zappa’s head. Zappa is available on Altitude.film
IWOW: I Walk on Water review – freeform meditation on New York's dispossessed	I Walk on Water is a hefty documentary project from artist and film-maker Khalik Allah: something that might be called an investigative meditation on the lives of the homeless, the marginal and the dispossessed in Harlem in New York City, and the film-maker’s own life. Lasting three hours and 19 minutes, it is an expansive collage of video, celluloid and 16mm, in colour and black-and-white, something close to underground cinema. Allah simply lets the camera roll open-endedly and talks to street people like the Haitian man nicknamed Frenchie (we never hear what his actual name is), whom he has photographed before. The director often uses the 125th Street subway station as his base of operations; he features rappers’ performances and also films the uniformed NYPD cops, whose faces are half-smiling masks of opaque indulgence. Allah brings his Italian girlfriend, Camila, into the story, recording his often agonised introspective conversations with her. (He reveals at one stage that apparently his film was going to be called “Camila”). He moreover bizarrely includes encounters with his own longsuffering parents: conversations during which he candidly reveals himself to be under the influence of shrooms and believes himself to be Jesus Christ – to his mother’s very considerable dismay. This sequence explains the title, and, also, on a slightly more serious level, could have something to do with his concerns for the lowly, the last whom Jesus said would be first. This is a film which has been described as “immersive”, though a sceptic might say that its sheer length means that audiences, however sympathetic, will inevitably at moments lose attention and de-immerse. Maybe some of it is redundant, and there are an awful lot of droning druggie conversations off-camera, including a very weird discussion about how awful brussels sprouts are. But the length is what gives it its texture, and its shapelessness is how it becomes exploratory, almost a real-time autobiography. Allah is asking profound questions, in his way, about what it is like to be people like Frenchie, to live outside the framework of connected prosperity. • Released on 26 February on digital platforms.
Erēmīta (Anthologies) review – lockdown experiments of varying accomplishment	Do not adjust your set. The long pauses of black screen during this studiedly serious anthology of experimental shorts made by cinematographers during the pandemic lockdown are deliberate. It’s been put together by the American-Egyptian director Sam Abbas, who invited five cinematographers to take part in his lockdown challenge, shooting a film on their phones. The result feels a bit like being fed a plate of arthouse vegetables, a collection of not always easy-to-watch films, randomly connected and with a total running time of 58 minutes that, to be honest, is a bit of a slog. The opening film is a purely experimental piece by Soledad Rodríguez, her camera prowling hungrily for images. She uses a filter or effect that makes even ordinary images look unsettlingly like a sci-fi or horror movie: in a wood, two dogs stand to attention and look like hounds of hell about to attack at any moment. Antoine Héberlé’s contribution, a self-conscious film with a new-wave feel about a woman sitting in her apartment listlessly staring out of her window, didn’t really work for me. Abbas has described the collection as being “about everything and nothing”. The film most obviously about something is directed by Alexis Zabé, the cinematographer behind the stunning images in Carlos Reygadas’s Post Tenebras Lux. Here he shoots an arresting mini-doc about a tent community of homeless people living in Venice Beach, Los Angeles. At the end, the camera lingers on a message attached to wire fencing: “Love. Be kind”. At first the letters seemed to me to be written in gold helium balloons. Actually, it’s yellow cordon tape – a hopeful message stamped all over with the words “caution”. I would happily watch 58 minutes of Zabé’s film, but in the main, these films would possibly work better on the walls of a gallery. • Released on 26 February on digital platforms.
Woody Allen denies claims in Allen v Farrow HBO documentary 	Woody Allen has rebutted renewed allegations, in the HBO documentary Allen v Farrow, that he sexually assaulted his daughter Dylan in 1992, calling the series “a hatchet job riddled with falsehoods”. In a statement to the Hollywood Reporter, Allen and his wife, Soon-Yi Previn, said that film-makers Amy Ziering and Kirby Dick had “spent years surreptitiously collaborating with the Farrows and their enablers to put together a hatchet job riddled with falsehoods”. They added: “As has been known for decades, these allegations are categorically false. Multiple agencies investigated them at the time and found that, whatever Dylan Farrow may have been led to believe, absolutely no abuse had ever taken place.” In a TV interview in 2018, Dylan Farrow denied she had been “brainwashed” or “coached” into making allegations against Allen. Allen v Farrow, which aired its first of four episodes on Sunday on HBO in the US, is described by Ziering and Dick as an investigation into the allegations, which emerged during the custody battle after Allen’s separation from Mia Farrow in 1992. Ziering also denied their film was “a collaboration … with [Dylan Farrow] or the family”. There has been no response so far from the Farrows regarding the claims made by Allen and Previn about the documentary. Allen has consistently denied any allegations of sexual abuse against Dylan Farrow, which were investigated in 1992-93 by Connecticut state police, the Child Sexual Abuse Clinic of Yale New Haven Hospital, and the New York Department of Social Services; none concluded that sexual assault had taken place. Mia Farrow and her son Ronan appear in Allen v Farrow, while Allen and Previn declined to participate. The statement says Allen and Previn “were approached less than two months ago and given only a matter of days ‘to respond’. Of course, they declined to do so.” Dylan’s brother Moses, who has defended Allen from the allegations, also reportedly declined to appear in the film. The Guardian spoke to the documentary’s lead investigator Amy Herdy who claims to have reached out to Allen’s team back in June 2018 but “got crickets back”. She added: “I know that they got my requests because I had an assistant on the phone” who said they were getting her emails. Ziering and Dick have previously worked together on a string of hard-hitting documentaries about sexual abuse, including the Oscar-nominated The Invisible War, which focused on rape in the US military and The Hunting Ground, about sex assaults on university campuses.
Ayouni review – a raging lament for Syria's 'disappeared'	Director Yasmin Fedda, who is from a Palestinian and Syrian background and lectures in film at Queen Mary University of London, has created a powerful and urgent documentary tribute to those who have been “forcibly disappeared” by the Assad regime in Syria, estimated to be around 150,000 since 2011. Fedda focuses on two people: dissident writer and computer programmer Bassel Khartabil, who was abducted in October 2015 in Damascus, and Father Paolo Dall’Oglio, the hugely popular and admired Christian priest who was taken in July 2013 in Raqqa. She uses existing video of these two, from various family members and organisations, along with her own footage showing the campaigns of the loved ones left behind with their burden of anguish and their need to battle on and bring these crimes to the world’s attention. In particular, we talk to Bassel’s wife, Noura Ghazi, and Paolo’s sister Immacolata, or Machi. Their testimony is deeply moving: they are courageous, stoic, determined. It is heartbreaking to see Noura, so young and joyous in Bassel’s company, then careworn and marooned in a spiritual void of uncertainty about whether Bassel is alive or dead. It is wrenching also when Machi tells us of the choice she has to make: to stop thinking about her brother or to endure the pain of continuing to campaign, to post online, to keep the search alive, but with it the danger of unthinkably raw grief. As she poignantly puts it: “I prefer to take the risk of hoping.” The forcibly disappeared of Syria emerge from this film as comparable to los desaparecidos of Argentina in the dark days of the junta – a tyranny that was brought low at least partly due to the women who bore public witness to those taken. Released on 26 February on True Story.
Emperor review – adventure trumps accuracy in civil war biopic	“The history of the civil war was written by white men to serve their own agenda. It’s time for a black man to tell his own story.” The narrative emancipation practised by Emperor, though, is questionable, considering that more than a few liberties are taken with the story of Shields “Emperor” Green, the escaped slave who was hanged after storming Harpers Ferry with John Brown in 1859. Sadly, they are not taken with the same revisionist audacity as Quentin Tarantino gave Django Unchained, with whom this shares a producer. Here, rewriting history seems to consist solely of insisting that exciting gunpowder-keg explosions were a daily occurrence in the 19th century. Dayo Okeniyi plays Green, who snaps and murders his overseer after the latter whips his son for reading a book. Fleeing for his life, he tries to tap into the underground railroad – and is soon dogged by an elite bounty hunter (Ben Robson) chasing the $1,000 price tag on his head. Director Mark Amin keeps Green on a strict action-movie schedule, packing his journey with swamp manhunts, caravan chases and bank robberies. Historical accuracy obviously isn’t the point, and the pursuit is undeniably rousing, if not subtle. Next to the statuesque Okeniyi, almost every white character looks like a raddled Confederate cadaver. One thing Emperor is sharp on is the pressure on slaves – and former slaves – to pursue their own self-interest at the expense of their peers. “What is more important – freedom for one man or freedom for all man?” asks James Cromwell’s Brown when the less radical abolitionist Frederick Douglass (Harry Lennix) offers Green passage to Canada. More fine-grained attention to the psychological atmosphere of the period could have made this an antebellum The Fugitive, every scene full of fear and desperation. Instead, it’s merely watchable, a low-stakes contribution to the current renaissance of African American film-making. • Emperor is available on digital platforms from 1 March. • This article was amended on 24 February 2021 to correct the spelling of Frederick Douglass’s first name.
Hearing you out: what hated movie would you defend?	For the last two months, we’ve tasked Guardian writers with the unenviable: putting together an impassioned defence of a film loathed by the masses. From Lindsay Lohan’s stripper doppelgänger horror I Know Who Killed Me to Steven Spielberg’s CG gopher-wrecking Indiana Jones sequel, there have been some much-debated pleas but now we want to hear from you. We’ll continue to plumb the depths twice a week but what’s the one film that most hated that you loved? A one star superhero movie? A crowd-displeasing comedy? A flop horror? Let us know in the comments and we’ll assemble a list of the most convincing arguments.
Jailbreak review – the great, ingenious, Chilean escape	Here is the story of the biggest prison escape in Chilean history. In 1990, during the final days of the Pinochet regime, 49 leftwing prisoners escaped from a Santiago jail via a 60-metre-long tunnel dug over 18 gruelling months with spoons and screwdrivers. Local newspapers called it “The Great Escape” and “An Escape for the Movies”; the event was a natural for the big screen. Jailbreak digs into this historic episode with thrilling oomph and awe. Much of the film’s pleasure derives from the ingenious ways the prisoners manage to dig the tunnel right under the noses of the watchful, sadistic guards. At one point, the crew use a pornographic poster to cover the opening to the crawl space where they would ultimately stack more than 50 tonnes of dirt. The guard takes no notice; he quips that the model is still wearing too many clothes. Later, the camera pulls back to reveal the real scope of the tunnel, all masterfully rigged with lights. Goosebumps. Although the construction of the tunnel overshadows the performances, the clash of personalities between the leaders of the break is engrossing enough. The quiet León Vargas (Benjamín Vicuña), who is still suffering from the loss of his family under the dictatorship, engineers the tunnel’s mechanics; the brassy Rafael Jiménez (Roberto Farías) remains the operation’s driving force. The female characters – the prisoners’ lawyer (Amparo Noguera) and Jiménez’s wife and outside liaison person (played by Francisca Gavilán) – add balance and nuance to an otherwise male-centric film. Exciting as it is, Jailbreak is hampered by sequences with stilted, over-expository dialogue that don’t do a great job of setting up the historical and ideological background; other than the prison conditions and the harsh death penalties awaiting seven of the prisoners, we don’t know much about the political stakes outside the jail’s four walls. Nevertheless, it’s an entertaining watch – particularly for a feature directorial debut – that alternates between moments of private turmoil and collective fervour. • Jailbreak is release on 1 March on digital platforms.
Shadowland review – hopelessly inept Highlands horror	Not to be confused with Shadowlands, the 1993 drama featuring a heartbroken CS Lewis, or Shadowland, a documentary about a knife-maker, or any number of films called Shadowland. Even without seeing them, you can be assured that this particular Shadowland is, at least in terms of production values, the worst. Almost thrillingly inept, writer-director Simon Kay’s amateurish horror feature would be more amusing to criticise if only it weren’t so lacking in any signs of talent, from the impenetrable storytelling that jumps around chronologically, to the clueless editing, to the cinematography that looks as if it was done on an early smartphone. And the acting? Peerlessly inexpressive, unconvincing, dreary. In a supposedly ancient Scottish forest (the kind of ancient forest where all the trees are growing equally spaced in straight lines), there’s an abandoned military research base where an ill-defined, barely seen evil creature is running around killing anyone who wanders into its path. An American ambassador (David E Grimes), his wife and two grown-up kids, are being accompanied by a cadre of soldiers when – wouldn’t you know it? – a kidnapping goes wrong. The survivors run into a strange-looking old man (Tony Greengrass) who is revealed to be, I think, the same person we see in flashback as a younger man (Gordon Houston) arriving at the base to work on some experiment. It’s hard to be sure because nothing makes any sense. This really looks like the result of something written on the back of a beer mat and made over a drunken weekend in someone’s uncle’s garden. • Shadowland is released on digital platforms on 1 March.
NHS warns against Gwyneth Paltrow’s 'kombucha and kimchi' Covid advice 	Gwyneth Paltrow has been urged to stop spreading misinformation by the medical director of NHS England after she suggested long Covid could be treated with “intuitive fasting”, herbal cocktails and regular visits to an “infrared sauna”. The Hollywood star, who markets unproven new age potions on her Goop website, wrote on her latest blogpost that she caught Covid-19 early and had since suffered “long-tail fatigue and brain fog”. Paltrow said that after turning to the advice of a “functional medicine practitioner”, she was told “this was a case where the road to healing was going to be longer than usual”. She then embarked on a “keto and plant-based” diet, involving fasting until 11am every day, “lots of coconut aminos” and sugar-free kombucha and kimchi. Paltrow went on to recommend her brand’s Madame Ovary supplement and Seedlip, “the incredible herbal nonalcoholic cocktails”. She added: “I’m doing an infrared sauna as often as I can, all in service of healing.” Paltrow also suggested there was evidence for the efficacy of such a diet. “I’ve been doing major research and finding some great stuff to support what I’m doing,” she wrote. However, her unproven advice prompted a stern rebuke from Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director for NHS England, who urged influencers such as Paltrow against spreading misinformation. He said: “In the last few days I see Gwyneth Paltrow is unfortunately suffering from the effects of Covid. We wish her well, but some of the solutions she’s recommending are really not the solutions we’d recommend in the NHS.” Powis added: “We need to take long Covid seriously and apply serious science. All influencers who use social media have a duty of responsibility and a duty of care around that. “Like the virus, misinformation carries across borders and it mutates and it evolves. So I think YouTube and other social media platforms have a real responsibility and opportunity here.” In 2018 Goop agreed to pay a substantial settlement over unproven claims about the health benefits of the infamous vaginal eggs it was selling. It claimed the eggs could balance hormones, regulate menstrual cycles, prevent uterine prolapse, and increase bladder control, according to officials in Santa Clara, part of a group of California district attorneys who filed the lawsuit. Last year she began selling a This Smells Like My Vagina candle through her Goop brand. She later revealed that the follow-up would be called This Smells Like My Orgasm.
Wrong Turn review – skull-crushing Appalachian horror	This horror is pretty crass and generic, yet there is occasionally a wacky gonzo energy to this film by director Mike P Nelson, the seventh movie in the Wrong Turn slasher franchise, which began back in 2003 in the classic 1970s style of The Hills Have Eyes. This is also a reboot or summation in that it is called, simply, Wrong Turn, like the first one, without the number seven. Charlotte Vega plays Jen, a fresh-faced twentysomething hiking the Appalachian trail with a group of her friends. After rashly deciding to go off the official path, into the dense woodland, in search of a “civil war fort” (an ominous destination if ever there was one), they are gruesomely set upon by sinister hillbillies and mountain men dressed in weird animal furs and skulls like Trumpites invading the Capitol. Jen’s earnest dad, Scott (Matthew Modine), comes looking for her, only to discover something horrifying about who these mountain folk actually are and the strange alternative society they have built in secret deep in the forest wilderness for a century or more. This film really is horribly violent, with people getting their skulls crushed, heads bashed in, ribcages collapsed and generally mutilated in all sorts of loathsome ways. It is by-the-numbers stuff, but the film starts to up its game when we find ourselves in the weird proto-postapocalyptic society in the hills that has stayed the same since the 19th century (but which, apparently, was founded on non-racial lines in opposition to the Confederacy and the Union). Jen gets a bit of a story arc that goes a little beyond the survivalist pieties of the Final Girl. It’s a bit silly and queasy, but the narrative motor keeps humming. • Wrong Turn is on digital platforms from 26 February.
The Stylist review – an insipid thriller three decades out of fashion	Sadly, nowadays there is no video for this to go straight to. Maybe someone should reopen a branch of Blockbuster just so a VHS copy can be ceremoniously placed in a bargain bin by the exit. The Stylist lumbers heavily along as if it’s wearing deep-sea diver’s boots, a queasy mash-up of serial-killer nightmare with 90s-style Single White Female-esque thriller. The acting and directing are entirely terrible, the editing and pacing are so sluggish you’ll feel as if you’re going into a persistent vegetative state, the plot is tiresomely unthought-through, the split-screen shots don’t work and the musical score is so pointless and undifferentiated it sounds like elevator muzak. I do have to admit that the final wedding scene, with one particular cutaway shot of a beaming bridesmaid, does have a certain OTT outrageousness. But that doesn’t justify the price of admission – or of sitting through all that has gone before. Najarra Townsend plays a hair stylist named Claire who is really good at her job. Her way with the scissors and other sharp implements, and her tender scalp caresses, sooth her customers. But she has a habit of offering after-hours haircuts in the salon, giving her customers a late-night glass of wine into which she’s slipped something, and taking Hannibal-style trophies. Then, slightly out of the blue – and this doesn’t really mesh with her creepy MO – Claire forms an obsession with one of her regulars, Olivia (Brea Grant), which this leads to something truly yucky. Exasperatingly, this film fails to tell us something basic: how exactly is Claire moving and disposing of the corpses once she’s done her horrible number on them? Is she burying them? Keeping them in a freezer? One of her victims is the subject of “Missing” fliers put up around town – but later we hear that this same person is getting a “funeral”. So … they found the body? Or what? Either way, this movie has no vital signs. Available from 1 March on Arrow.
Gatecrash review – opaque auto-accident drama	Adapted from a play by Terry Hughes, this pent-up and then purgatively violent drama revolves around an offscreen car accident that sends a handful of characters colliding into each other. Clearly already dancing a miserable tango of abuse, Nicole (Olivia Bonamy) and Steve (Ben Cura) come home to their isolated house in the country, decorated in shades of taupe, grey and plum to match Nicole’s bruises, after Steve runs over a stranger on the road on the way home from a party. Though he was driving and chose to leave the scene of the crime, he still blames Nicole for distracting him with an argument. As this display of toxic masculinity approaches its full operatic pitch, suddenly there’s someone at the door: policeman (Samuel West), all creepy chirpy banter, who’s wondering if they’ve seen anything strange lately. There’s quite a lot that’s strange here, including repeated chunks of dialogue that transfer from one character to another, the opaque motivations of several characters, and whether some of this is meant to be fantasy or just heavy-handed melodrama. Plus, there’s a mysterious second-act appearance from another creepy character named Sid, played by Anton Lesser (best known on TV for Game of Thrones and Wolf Hall). Lesser is the best thing in this, giving a layered performance that hints at a backstory that the actor at least may have conceived in detail even if the screenplay, credited to director Lawrence Gough and Alan Pattinson, doesn’t give him much to work with. Perhaps this worked better on stage, but as film it’s neither fish nor fowl, lacking neither the surrealism to give it a Lynchian dream logic, nor the psychological insight to make it work as realism. • Available on digital platforms.
The Dark and the Wicked review – devilishly directed farmhouse horror	The Dark and the Wicked is a nastily effective, lo-fi, psychological haunted house horror about a malevolent force that takes up residence in a remote Texas farmhouse (shot at director Bryan Bertino’s family home). There is possibly not a single scary moment here that will be new to horror fans, but Bertino directs with such technical flair that I yelped at most of them – and half-missed the others, eyes squeezed tight shut. Louise (Marin Ireland) is on a visit back to the farm where her bedridden dad (Michael Zagst) is dying. Her brother, Michael (Michael Abbott Jr), is here too, a hulking lunk in a lumberjack shirt who seems emotionally avoidant, rarely making eye contact. Everything about the farm feels creepy as hell: the sheep bleating in the barn, homemade wind chimes rattling. The land itself has a forsaken feel, abandoned by the younger generation. Refreshingly, Bertino’s emotionally literate script gives the family very real dynamics. Drinking beer on the porch one evening, the siblings experience a stab of guilt, realising how long it’s been since they last visited. What’s strange is that their mother (Julie Oliver-Touchstone) isn’t exactly welcoming. “I told you not to come,” she hisses. In her diary, she’s been writing about a diabolical force taking over the house. The first gruesome scare involves the mother chopping carrots with a very large knife. Worse is to come from the evil presence (named the Wicked in the credits), who the audience sees in the shadows in a couple of blood-run-cold “he’s behind you” moments. Wisely, Bertino exercises restraint, not revealing too much about the Wicked. But that does leave his script open to the accusation of narrative thinness – and with the bodies piling up, you’d expect a cop or two to come sniffing around. • Released on 25 February on Shudder.
Paramount to launch streaming service for new and old films	Paramount has become the latest studio to unveil plans for a streaming service it hopes will help maximise profits on films whose release has been affected by the pandemic. Paramount Plus, which launches on 4 March, will feature archive content as well as carrying new movies 30 days after theatrical release – or 45 for tentpole titles. These include oft-postponed releases such as Top Gun: Maverick (due in cinemas on 2 July), A Quiet Place II (17 September) and Mission: Impossible 7 (19 November). “Audiences are changing in their habits and we want to make sure that these films are available when they’re fresh after a full theatrical run,” Paramount Pictures CEO Jim Gianopulos told Variety on Wednesday. Mission: Impossible 7 wrapped filming last week after a long-running shoot involving multiple restarts in a wide variety of locations. Post-production is now under way in London ahead of the proposed release over the Thanksgiving weekend holiday in the US. The move is another blow for cinema owners seeking to shore up trade post-lockdown. Disney and Warner Bros have already launched popular streaming services either in tandem with a cinematic release or – particularly in the US, where most venues have been closed for almost a year – as standalone platforms. Universal recently struck a deal with key US chains that would allow them to stream new titles after only 17 days in cinemas. Paramount also announced TV series based on hit movies such as The Italian Job, Love Story, Flashdance and Fatal Attraction.
Hellraiser: Judgment review – diminishing, misogynist returns for classic franchise	There have been so many additions to the Hellraiser franchise since the first one debuted in 1987 that we’ve now got to the stage when it’s best not to remind viewers how many there have been, lest the young uns think it’s some kind of musty Gen X thing that just won’t die. Which it kind of is, to be honest. This latest contribution, written and directed by makeup effects specialist Gary J Tunnicliffe, feels like a pretty degraded mutation from the original concept. Where the first few Hellraisers had an interesting if somewhat icky erotic tang to them – alluding to S&amp;M/fetish culture as much as horror, and featuring female protagonists – Judgment is less about desire than just straight-up misogyny and gory, gross-out money shots. The franchise’s iconic demon Pinhead is back once again (of course), played here by Paul T Taylor. But he’s more of a background presence as an assortment of other demons, including one played by Tunnicliffe himself, take over the business of bedevilling humanity via what sounds like insurance industry-based methods of torture, given they call themselves The Auditor, The Assessor and whatnot. Among the living, the main characters are a trio of cops – two of them brothers Sean (Damon Carney) and David Carter (Randy Wayne), as well as rookie Christine (Alexandra Harris) – who are investigating what seems to be a serial killer case. One of the first victims is a young woman (Grace Montie) who dares to be sexually active, and ends up with her lapdog and mobile phone sewn up inside her body. Elsewhere, there’s a trio of supernatural vamps who sit in judgment over souls and have fake blood hosed on to their large naked breasts, which I guess is one way to get your jollies. The dialogue is execrable, which partly excuses the inert performances; the sets – including one that looks like a shop’s filament bulb display – are more interesting to look at than the actors. • Released on 22 February on digital platforms.
Restless Natives review – classic Scottish comedy is a reminder of a sweeter era	“Guns are for LASSIES! Nobody seems to put the BOOT in any more!” This rousing manifesto for muscular non-armed crime of the traditional sort comes from one of the hardened villains that surreally pop up in this intensely likable Scottish caper from 1985, with a soundtrack from Big Country. It was part of a boom in Britmovie comedy of the era when Scotland was becoming caustically alienated from Thatcherite England, and which gave us Bill Forsyth’s Gregory’s Girl, Comfort and Joy and Local Hero. The script from Ninian Dunnett was originally the winning entry of a screenwriting competition (Dunnett in fact wrote no more for the screen after this, and became an author and social historian) and it was directed by the anglophile and caledonophile American Michael Hoffman. Joe Mullaney plays Ronnie, a likely Edinburgh lad who works in a joke shop, like Miranda Hart. He and his nervy mate Will (Vincent Friell) decide they’re sick of being poor and resolve to tour around the countryside on their motorbike, in a clown and wolfman disguise, robbing tourist buses – which they do so politely that they become folk heroes. Bryan Forbes and Nanette Newman provide cameos as a grumpy English couple who assume they’re a student “rag week” stunt and fob them off with one of the big 50p coins of the day. But when the lads’ criminal career takes off, a mean American cop over here on holiday, played by Ned Beatty, gets on their trail with his flashy big mobile phone (“It’s the Man from UNCLE!” giggle the local officers) and tension emerges between the two bandits. Will finds himself romantically involved with Margot (Teri Lally), a tour guide on a bus he’d just stuck up, and Ronnie falls in some with serious villains, led by a deadpan Mel Smith. Kids keep cropping up in the action – unsentimental and unimpressed by both the cops and the robbers. It’s the kind of gentle and yet sweetly funny use of children that British cinema just doesn’t do any more. Ronnie and Will are in some ways innocent forerunners of Renton, Spud et al in Trainspotting, and also a prototype Wallace and Gromit. Released on 1 March on digital platforms.

Moxie review – Amy Poehler's high-school comedy plays it straight	A high-school movie directed by Amy Poehler, the SNL comedy blackbelt who starred in Parks and Recreation? And who is incidentally the longtime performing partner of Tina Fey, who created the high-school classic Mean Girls? Is this going to be hilarious, or what? Sadly no. Solemnly based on a novel by YA author Jennifer Mathieu, Moxie could be called Nice Girls or Mutually Supportive Girls. Poehler herself has a small role as the single mom of a smart, lonely teenage girl called Vivian (Hadley Robinson) who is best friends with Claudia (Lauren Tsai), but whose intimacy with her is about to be damaged by her admiration for supercool new girl Lucy (Alycia Pascual-Peña), and her growing romantic situation with the impeccably right-on and pro-feminist supportive guy Seth (Nico Hiraga). Enraged by the boorish, sexist behaviour of the obnoxious football star Mitchell (Patrick Schwarzenegger), and the way he is indulged by the school, Vivian gets inspired by her mom’s long-since forgotten protest persona, and she starts a zine called Moxie and triggers a feminist revolution at the school which challenges her friendships and her sense of herself. The film is intensely, almost radically humourless, which is hard to ignore and in fact hard to bear, because of this film’s obvious resemblance to recent great movies like Booksmart or Lady Bird and particularly at times the hard-edged classic Election. In fact, Moxie feels like someone has put those films through a machine for extracting the comedy and the political satire. The movie tackles diversity, bullying and rape, but does it all very glibly. The target audience will surely be aware of the canon of superior, funny movies – and they will be baffled to see that Poehler doesn’t want to do something similar. • Released on 3 March on Netflix.
Body Brokers review – drug abusers feed addiction to profit	While films such as Traffic and Sicario focused on the supply side of the US war on drugs, John Swab’s third feature takes on the demand part of the equation. An expletive-spattered prologue fills us in on how the Obamacare act’s obligation for healthcare-providers to cover drug-abuse treatment created a market for recovery facilities worth $12bn a year in southern California alone. Swab then zeroes in on pasty Ohio junkie Utah (Jack Kilmer), plucked from heroin deadendsville and offered free rehab on the west coast by Wood (Michael Kenneth Williams), a broker acting on behalf of treatment centres to find addicts whose stay will be funded by insurance companies. After completing the programme, Utah graduates to becoming an apprentice to Wood and quickly realises the size of the fraud at hand. Wood hauls in patients at scale by offering them a cut of the insurance money; the system has no incentive to see them permanently recover because relapsing addicts mean repeat business. Wood also runs the same ploy on subcutaneous implants that inhibit opiate addiction, delivering a stream of punters worth $60,000 each to a local surgeon. The cynicism and human collateral of it all makes it the narco-industrial complex’s version of sub-prime. Emblazoned with mouthy Big Short-style info-dumps, and with a phone-selling scene reminiscent of The Wolf of Wall Street, Body Brokers outwardly seems to be aiming for high Scorsesian amoral operatics. But given the originality of Swab’s take, it’s a shame he couldn’t find the film a more appropriate style: at heart it is a more sober film intent on declaring its outrage. Kilmer, son of actors Val and Joanne Whalley, is a little bland in the ingenue role, not really digging into the sense that something malignant squirms beneath: not just substance dependency but also American addiction to capitalism – as hinted at by two uses of Public Image Ltd’s Rise on the soundtrack, with its cry that “anger is an energy”. But the Mephistophelean Wood is a great role for Williams; another man running game on the system, like his Omar from The Wire, but the moral compass long since pawned off. • Released on 8 March on digital platforms.
Lucky review – home-invasion horror that's a stand against violence, on repeat	This clever thriller teeters on the brink of abstraction, and walks a razor wire between horror and an incredulous absurdity meant to stand for how women must live in the modern world: the daily toll of living in fear of aggression, physical assault and withstanding the misogynistic structures that excuse them. At 2.29am one night, writer May (Brea Grant) peers over her balustrade to see an interloper, features blurred by a gel mask, staring up at her from the backyard. When she retreats to bed to tell husband Ted, he is disturbingly blase: “Honey, that’s the man. The man that comes every night and tries to kill us.” Ted manages to off the housebreaker with a pool cue, but his body disappears within seconds. The next night, and the next, May must do it all over again. As this Groundhog Day home invasion unspools, other characters display the same weird acceptance as Ted. More than the physical threat, it’s as if a new unfathomable reality is creeping in and violating her own. The police response is half-hearted and, adding to the conspiratorial air, Ted packs his bags after an argument: “I can’t change this. This is just how things are.” After these microaggressions, the next macro one is incoming; you might expect an It Follows-style air of inexorable dread to set in, but May remains upbeat. Grant also wrote the script as well as starring, and perhaps it’s this closeness to the core ideas that allows her to pivot spryly between romcom perkiness and a nauseated hesitancy that suggests the dislocation between normal life and its violent substrate. Towards the end, there’s a suggestion that May’s public tough-it-out credo – she is plugging a self-help book called Go It Alone – may be, in some sense, perpetuating these attacks. Possibly this is acknowledging that the strong-woman ideal championed by some quarters of the #MeToo movement comes at the expense of a more realistic and collaborative feminism. Natasha Kermani’s film is an elliptical but vehement statement on the post-#MeToo landscape. If the film’s story development is stymied by the narrative’s ultimate stasis, it is to all the better point out that the fight is far from finished. • Released on 4 March on Shudder.
Biggie: I Got a Story to Tell review – Netflix doc sidesteps murder mystery for moving life story	Perhaps posthumous legacy was always on the mind of late rapper Christopher “Notorious BIG” Wallace. His impactful debut album Ready to Die was followed by Life After Death, released 16 days after he was killed aged 24, in a still-unsolved, drive-by shooting. Yet while there have been several filmic attempts to capture this legascy –– including Nick Broomfield’s 2002 documentary Biggie &amp; Tupac and the 2009 biopic Notorious –– this Netflix release is the first to successfully sidestep the quicksand of murder mystery, and focus instead on what Wallace accomplished in life. Clearly redressing that balance was the motivation of at least two executive producers, including Wallace’s label boss and friend, Sean “Diddy” Combs, who early on declares: “This story doesn’t have to have a tragic ending.” It’s the contribution of Wallace’s mother, though, that’s particularly significant. Firstly in the form of family photos and stories illustrating a childhood spent between their Brooklyn neighbourhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant and her family’s home in Trelawny, Jamaica. There, young Wallace’s favourite uncle exposed him to sound system culture, while back in Brooklyn a jazz musician neighbour played him Max Roach and Clifford Brown. So that by the time a 17-year-old Biggie triumphed in the now-legendary rap battle on Bedford and Quincy, he was already “rhyming in a way that exudes all the finer qualities of a bebop drum solo”. More subtly though, Ms Wallace’s involvement gives permission for loyal associates to open up about the “gangster” part of “gangster rapper”. The darkest rumours are omitted, but there’s a detailed account of how Biggie came to dominate the local crack cocaine economy. These mid-90s, north-west Brooklyn specificities are fascinating and relevant; to Biggie’s art, certainly, but possibly also to his death. • Released on 1 March on Netflix.
Eye of the Storm review – moving film about Scottish painter in love with nature	Scottish painter James Morrison died shortly before the completion of this affectionate documentary about his life and work which premiered at the Glasgow film festival, and it’s a fitting tribute to an articulate and self-effacing artist with an extraordinary affinity for Scotland’s everchanging land- and seascapes. It’s directed by Anthony Baxter, best known for highlighting the stubborn local resistance to Donald Trump’s golf course in Aberdeenshire with his You’ve Been Trumped films; this is something of a change of pace, while offering a not-dissimilar celebration of a very Scottish style of quiet, unfussy determination. Morrison’s story is interesting enough – born and raised in Glasgow, the son of ship’s fitter, who settled on the east coast and made epic trips to paint abroad, most notably to the Arctic – but it’s added to here by a plangent late-life twist: he is losing his sight, to the extent he can barely see what he is painting. True to form, Morrison accepted this as uncomplainingly as anything else – “irritating” is the strongest imprecation I can recall – and there’s something inexpressibly moving about the way he strokes a blank sheet of paper taped to his easel as if he can’t wait to get started. This is by no means an emotionless film, however: Morrison talks passionately about his wife, Dorothy, who died in 2015, and introduces us to a stormily epic landscape painting he calls “a portrait of grief”. In fact, all of Morrison’s work appears suffused with a kind of religious awe at his surroundings; Baxter artfully inserts beautiful drone shots of big skies, beetling cliffs and rolling hills as an echo of Morrison’s canvases. His Arctic sequence – huge chunks of ice, floating in intense dark blue seas – stands out in terms of spectacle, but Morrison preferred to talk in terms of his own “argument with himself”. As a painter, Morrison ought to be better known; this film should give his reputation and legacy a major uplift. • Released on 5 March in virtual cinemas and digital platforms.
Backtrace review – Sylvester Stallone memory-loss heist caper is one to forget	This plodding crime thriller came out in the US in 2018 but now is its chance to dazzle the UK with its dullness, straight-to-digital lost heist-money shenanigans and easy-to-see-coming plot twists. The whole thing is really waxy and sad, like the immobile face of co-star Sylvester Stallone; although the chance to enjoy the always interesting, never-as-big-as-he-should-have-been Matthew Modine, still looking pretty fly with a shock of white-and-gold hair, is very welcome. An opening blam-blam shootout establishes the stakes and premise: a gang of criminals and inside men plotted and pulled off a bank heist, only to get ambushed in the woods. The multimillion-dollar haul was never found, and the only survivor was Donovan MacDonald (Modine). Unfortunately, a head wound left him with profound retrograde amnesia, and he spends another seven years in a medical penitentiary not even able to remember the crime he’s accused of or, more importantly, where the money is. But nurse Erin (Meadow Williams), fellow inmate Lucas (Ryan Guzman) and shady security guard Farren (Tyler Jon Olson) bust him out of prison and administer an experimental drug that might help him recover his memory if it doesn’t kill him first. Meanwhile, Stallone plays a local cop who has been making one of those mood boards with mugshots and strings wound between push pins for years, and is now being compelled to work with an FBI agent (Christopher McDonald, always a hoot) with a dodgy moustache. The lawmen get far less air time than Modine and Co, which is a blessing really. Shot in Georgia, a popular filming location, and here playing itself for a change, the whole dreary thing looks as if it was put through an Instagram filter called Rotgut that makes everything look like it was soaked in weak coffee and bile. Somehow it fits the depressed, post-industrial mood that the climax takes place in an abandoned concrete factory. • Available from 5 March on Amazon Prime Video.
Last Moment of Clarity review – neo-noir in double trouble	Brothers Colin and James Krisel and/or actor Zach Avery must be either very well financed or ridiculously persuasive because they’ve managed to pull together a supporting cast and budget for this debut thriller that far exceeds what the script seems to warrant. At heart, Last Moment of Clarity is a slight, imaginatively thin B-movie which doesn’t so much as allude to Alfred Hitchcock’s Rear Window and Vertigo as outright steal from them brazenly, ending up with a limp neo-noir that unfolds in the streets of Paris and classy apartments in Los Angeles. There are cameos from Brian Cox and Udo Kier, both great scene-stealing actors with many virtues other than accent mimicry, judging by the bizarre Scots-French mashup Cox tries out here that is only a hair’s breadth better than Kier’s eastern European-German gangster stylings. In any case, each of them appears only fleetingly; the bulk of the running time features Avery as a schlubby guy from New York named Sam who is hiding out in Paris. Sam mooches about the streets and works for bar owner Cox, all the while mourning the loss of his girlfriend, Georgia (Samara Weaving), who died at the hands of some lesser gangsters who work for Kier’s character, for reasons only gradually revealed. When he sees an actor named Lauren in a movie who looks just like Georgia, he becomes convinced that the two women are one and the same, and flies to La La Land to find out. Enter Kat, played by the mesmeric Carly Chaikin, who ends up palling up with Sam, giving Chaikin a chance to play another variation on the manic pixie dream girl type she played in Mr Robot. The script is full of such daft coincidences you keep expecting there will be a clever twist to explain – but no, it really is that lazily written. At least the cinematography (by Andrew Wheeler) has atmosphere and the Parisian shots are pretty. • Available from 8 March on digital formats.
Golden Globes suffers catastrophic drop in TV ratings	To add to the difficulties besetting the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), early TV ratings for its Sunday-night Golden Globes awards show have dropped catastrophically from previous levels. They are likely to become the lowest since the show returned to NBC in 1996. Ratings agency Nielsen’s early “fast national” figures reveal that the show was 60% down on last year’s edition, drawing around 5.4 million viewers in the 18-49 age group, compared to 14.8 million for a similar estimate last year. The final total is likely to rise – the 2020 ratings ended at 18.5 million after all data was collected – but the 2021 total is set to fall well below the 14.7 million recorded in 2009. The poor audience figures underscore problems the HFPA are facing, having signed an agreement with NBC in 2018 that earns the organisation around $60m per year for eight years. Coronavirus restrictions forced the show into a virtual format, as well as a shift from its traditional January slot, depriving it of strong lead-in shows such as NFL games that helped boost its figures. The delays affecting the wider film industry also meant that the kind of commercial star-driven films that boost audience numbers were largely absent from this year’s ceremony. More seriously, the stream of criticism aimed at the HFPA for its perceived lack of diversity and ethical lapses, as well as its underwhelming response to complaints, could have long-term implications for the Globes’ credibility. A recent report in the LA Times suggested that the HFPA was unwilling to reform its membership policy for financial reasons. Tina Tchen, CEO of campaign group Time’s Up, criticised the HFPA for offering a “cosmetic” solution. Hosted by Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, the show resulted in big wins for Nomadland and its director Chloé Zhao, as well as The Crown, which took home four awards in the TV section.
Justine review – tender Brighton-set queer romance with social angst	Remember all-consuming crushes and awkward first dates? For young people in this age of self-isolation, such tender encounters might well be from another century. Chronicling a young lesbian romance set in a wintry Brighton, Justine is the remedy to the lack of such human contact. But it’s not all coffee dates and beach cuddles: this film is also a window on the harrowing cycle of addiction among displaced young adults. Justine (Tallulah Haddon), on probation and cut off from her family, is in a state of disarray. Awakened by loud bangs from the door – her landlord is asking for this month’s rent – Justine staggers dazedly, and fully clothed, out of the bath. Her lips bear a nasty cut, and her left arm is covered in swathes of white bandages. This dire scene opens to a more hopeful past, only three months earlier, when Justine first locks eyes with Rachel (Sophie Reid), a teacher-to-be, in a bookstore. Harsh financial realities immediately undercut the sweetness of this meet-cute. Rachel gasps as Justine slyly pockets a copy of Ovid’s Heroides. Despite their differing backgrounds, the two women quickly fall in love. The chemistry between Haddon and Reid, as well as their characters’ budding romance, makes Justine special and moving. With all the current industry talk about unnecessary sex scenes, the couple’s first night together has an awkward charm. It’s rare that a film captures so acutely the strange yet exhilarating feelings of two foreign bodies learning to adapt to each other, plus the difficulty of quickly disrobing your new lover of their jeans. In contrast, though, Justine’s descent into alcohol-fuelled self-destruction is handled somewhat less impressively, over-reliant on a series of sombre-sounding songs on the soundtrack. It’s a manipulative and hollow tactic that does a disservice to Haddon’s committed acting. Despite these heavy-handed moments, Justine remains a poignant study of a young woman struggling to stay afloat. • Released on 5 March on digital platforms.
Rishi Sunak extends insurance scheme for film and TV production	The government has extended its £500m insurance scheme protecting film and TV productions in the UK against the cost of Covid shutdowns until the end of the year. Last year, more than £2.8bn was spent on making Hollywood blockbusters and prestige dramas in the UK, from Line of Duty, War of the Worlds and The Witcher to Jurassic World: Dominion, Mission: Impossible 7, Batman and the third instalment of the Fantastic Beasts franchise. The scheme, which was due to end in April, has so far supported more than 200 productions to get back up and running, saving an estimated 24,000 jobs since being launched in October. Despite the support, the total amount spent on film and high-end TV production fell by a fifth last year, as all productions across the UK were forced to close in the early months of the pandemic. However, the introduction of the scheme and industry-wide move to Covid-safe sets fuelled a £1.2bn spending spree in the final quarter of last year, the second highest ever quarterly spend on record, as broadcasters, Hollywood studios and streamers rushed to plug the pandemic gap in fresh content that viewers were facing.
Into the Darkness review – a Danish family at war as the Nazis roll in	Veteran film-maker Anders Refn has had top-billing as a director on a few films that aren’t terribly well known beyond his native Denmark. His reputation is mostly built on his long service as an editor with a very impressive filmography, having cut such films as Breaking the Waves and Antichrist for Lars Von Trier, as well as Sally Potter’s Ginger &amp; Rosa. He also happens to be the father of a more famous film-maker, the flamboyantly talented Nicolas Winding Refn (The Neon Demon, Drive). But judging by Into the Darkness, a historical drama directed and co-written by the elder Refn, father and son couldn’t have more different sensibilities. Not that this second world war-set family saga is at all bad; it’s just very conventional, and feels like it might have been originally conceived as a multi-part drama for television. At its best, the film’s soapy immersion in local history recalls the German epic TV show Heimat. At its worst, it’s a little dry and thumpingly didactic as the various members of the haut-bourgeois Skov family experience the consequences of their moral choices played out as war rages on, even in their relatively quiet corner of occupied Denmark. Patriarch Karl (the great Jesper Christensen) runs a factory that is doing well enough to keep his alcoholic wife, Eva (Bodil Jørgensen), in pretty frocks and nice tableware while their numerous children have pretty much everything they want. But once the Nazis roll into town, the family is fractured along ideological lines, making for some very awkward Christmas Eves. Ne’er-do-well eldest Aksel (Mads Reuther) finds himself more sympathetic to anti-Nazi leftists: at first because of his friendship with the housekeeper’s son (Cyron Melville) and later because he fancies a pretty Bolshevik (Kathrine Thorborg Johansen). Meanwhile, another son (Gustav Dyekjær Giese) joins the Danish army and fights side by side with the Germans, and naive daughter Helene (Sara Viktoria Bjerregaard) is smitten with a dashing German U-boat officer, much to the disgust of her mother. Assorted Jewish friends are carted off and killed, leaving various members of the family questioning their choices. If you have 152 minutes to sink into this morass of moral complexity and finely observed period detail, then it may well be worth it, although the ending is bizarrely, perplexingly abrupt. Perhaps there will be a follow-up feature. • Into the Darkness is released on 5 March on digital platforms.
The Final Stand review – old-fashioned flag-waving for Mother Russia	Here’s a tale of chest-puffing courage and one-dimensional heroism from Russia during the second world war: an old-fashioned patriotic epic with slo-mo action scenes, intestines spewed on the battlefield and a soppy sentimental romance. It is based on real events in 1941, when more than 3,000 young military cadets were sent to the frontline to defend Moscow. Their mission was to buy time, holding off the Germans for five or six days until reinforcements arrived. Only a third survived. The cadets are still three months from graduating military school when the order comes to mobilise. These lads are future Red Army commanders, the brightest and the best. Two of them, best friends Lavrov (Artyom Gubin) and Shemyakin (Igor Yudin), are in love with the same girl, trainee doctor Masha (Lubov Konstantinova). Good-looking Lavrov is a crack-shot gunner, recklessly brave and romantic. Shemyakin is gentle and decent, a bit dull. You can guess which one Masha kisses in the broom cupboard. All three end up on the frontline, a town 200km from Moscow, as German tanks roll in. The soldiers around them are collection of cliches: there’s the strapping country boy dreaming of his mother’s borscht, and the speccy intellectual who translates when they capture a Nazi; otherwise, the Germans are a faceless horde. “This is not a war, it’s a massacre,” says an army doctor as the bodies pile up. Hopelessly outnumbered, the cadets are shot, burned alive, blown to bits. But director Vadim Shmelyov actually seems a bit squeamish about immersing his audience in the hell, death and chaos of war. He seems more interested in glorifying the cadet’s sacrifice and valour with a clumsy jingoistic script. Take the lad blinded in battle, a bandage wrapped around his head. He’s refusing to go to hospital, professing to the heavens as the music swells: “I still have my hands. I can load machine gun belts.” • Available from 8 March on digital platforms.
Wander Darkly review – Sienna Miller drives psychological indie drama	Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind meets Ghost in this relationship indie from Tara Miele about a woman who is killed – or is she? – in a car crash. Sienna Miller is brilliant as gallerist Adrienne, who’s out on a date night (“it’s cheaper than couple’s therapy”) with her partner Matteo (Diego Luna) in Los Angeles. Frazzled and sleep-deprived from parenting their six-month-old Ellie, they’re bickering when their car hits an oncoming SUV. At the hospital, Adrienne has an out-of-body experience, watching as porters cover her bloodied body with a sheet and push the gurney along corridors to the morgue. Next, she steps out of the hospital into scenes of the future without her: Matteo at her funeral, baby Ellie grown into a teenager. Then Miele’s script yanks the rug away. Adrienne is at home, very much alive, a pharmacy of pills on the bedside table. It’s all been a dream. At least, that’s what everyone is telling her; she is concussed, disoriented. But Adrienne is convinced she’s dead. To help her make sense of what’s happening, Matteo suggests they relive the history of their relationship. But each brings their own resentment to the story, so the memory flashbacks change depending on who’s talking. As a couple, were they flawed from the beginning? “It’s so sad we fell apart,” says Adrienne, but actually the love story is the least interesting thing here – it’s a bit generic and insipid. What’s really impressive is how Miele pulls off the tone shift from naturalistic portrait of a couple to psychological drama to moments with just an undertone of horror – in one, Adrienne, checking the cot, sees the baby stiff and lifeless, and becomes hysterical. From the confusion and alarm on Matteo’s face you know that she is hallucinating. It’s clammily claustrophobic. Miller is at the heart of the film; her natural and believable performance touches so many emotions, and makes them all look so real. Adrienne can be funny about her condition. Watching a zombie movie she jokes: “These are my people.” But her terror of being pulled into nothingness is so convincing – which is quite a feat in a film that’s so contrived. • Wander Darkly is released on 8 March on digital platforms.
My Donkey, My Lover & I review – eat, bray, love … and French manners	In a Paris primary school, a class of eight-year-olds sit behind their desks, eyes squeezed shut, counting to 20. At the back of the room their teacher, Antoinette (Laure Calamy), is getting undressed, slipping into silk frock for the school concert. “It’s not too much?” she asks the pupils. She’s having an affair with one of the dads – he’s married. Thus, with unparalleled Frenchness, begins this easygoing, warm comedy following Antoinette as she accidentally-on-purpose goes on the same donkey-trekking holiday as her lover’s family. As Antoinette bonds with her donkey, the movie evolves from gentle farce to journey of emotional growth. You might call it Eat Bray, Love – except it’s European, so there’s less pseudo-spiritual self-discovery and more drunken snogging. Antoinette is meant to be spending the first week of summer holidays alone with lover Vladimir (Benjamin Lavernhe) while his family are at the beach. Instead, when his wife surprises him with a family hiking holiday, Antoinette impulsively books herself a place, too: six days of 20km hikes, staying in hostels. She arrives in teeny denim hot pants and huge wedge sandals – there’s as much Bridget Jones in her DNA as Julia Roberts. But Vladimir is nowhere to be seen, and, predictably, it’s not love at first sight with her stubborn donkey Patrick either. There are some subtly pointed scenes at the beginning of the trek as a succession of guys mansplain to Antoinette how to manage her donkey. “Show him who’s boss,” says one handing her a whip. Instead, she uses her empathetic teaching style to win the beast over – and Calamy really grounds the movie with her funny, generous performance. The showdown with Vladimir and his wife, when it finally comes, is a lesson in the famous French casualness about infidelity. But Antoinette’s affair slips into insignificance quite quickly; the real chemistry here is with the four-legged ass, not the human one. • Released on 5 March on Curzon Home Cinema.
Letter: Ronald Pickup obituary	In 1979 I flew out to Sicily with the great Ronald Pickup for a long weekend – he to film a cameo as Stravinsky in a glossy biopic about the dancer Nijinsky, I as a film trade paper observer. On the flight, we joked about the potential pitfalls of such biopics, as in: “Hark, I think I hear Dickens writing his latest novel.” Cut to the set at the exquisite Bellini opera house in Catania, where Stravinsky sits at a (dummy) keyboard hammering out his latest composition. As he finishes with a flourish, the impresario Diaghelev (Alan Bates) inquires excitedly of its title. “I call it Le Sacre du Printemps,” Pickup replies portentously, adding a helpful subtitle for potential US audiences: “The Rite of Spring.” At which point I swear that Pickup caught my eye as I sat stifling giggles on the corner of the set.
The Last Shift – Richard Jenkins lifts up mismatched buddy film	In writer-director Andrew Cohn’s deceptively modest drama The Last Shift, fast-food worker Stanley (Richard Jenkins) is finally calling it quits. He has worked the graveyard shift at Oscar’s Chicken and Fish for 38 years, but now he’s moving from Michigan to Florida to take care of his elderly mother; grease be gone. He’s proud of his tenure, slickly handling the drunks and the teens who ridicule him, rarely putting a foot wrong. But when he’s forced to train his replacement, the opinionated twentysomething Jevon (Shane Paul McGhie), Stanley starts to reconsider his life’s work and whatever meaning he might have attached to it. Jevon is dismissive of the job, forced into it while on probation after defacing a federal monument, and aiming to return to his love of writing when his circumstances allow. Jevon is smart but difficult, failing his beleaguered girlfriend and young son, unable to knuckle down and provide. It’s a mismatched buddy film, but not entirely unsuccessful thanks largely to Jenkins, who can play a role such as this with his eyes closed, and McGhie who captures a mixture of righteousness and despondency. It sort of ambles along with no great imprint until a sharpish left turn as Cohn tries to transform his small-town drama into something far greater. Talk of race and class clumsily enters the picture – Jevon is black while Stanley is white – with a rushed sequence of events suddenly trying to say something about the American divide. There’s an attempt to humanise bigotry that feels a little uneasy (perhaps surer hands could have tackled this differently), and the shift in focus feels a little underpowered, with a final note that lands with a whimper. • The Last Shift is released on 8 March on digital platforms.
Iorram (Boat Song) review – swims with the ghosts of Scottish fishermen past	Here is a gentle and ruminative, if slightly placid, documentary from director Alastair Cole, about the fishermen of the Western Isles and their way of life catching herring, eels and lobsters. Despite technological advances (and presumably Brexit – though it isn’t mentioned) this world has remained essentially unchanged for a century or more. One shot shows a man unselfconsciously smoking a cigarette as the catch is sifted through, quite as he might have done in 1921. What is notable about this film is that the only spoken language we hear is Scottish Gaelic. What this means, in practice, is that the scenes of the modern fishing industry and the fishing way of life are shown with a soundtrack of audio interviews (in Scottish Gaelic) with fishermen talking about their working lives, dating evidently from the 1940s or 1950s, though the film does not make the provenance of these tapes clear. The effect is to show a particular sort of modernity with the ghosts and the echoes of the past not so very far from the surface. Watching the film, I did wonder if the people we were seeing on screen were actually English speakers – but no, Scottish Gaelic is what they speak as well. That being the case, I would have very much liked to hear from them, speaking directly, about their world. It might have brought this film to life a bit more. And as for the archive audio material, I would have preferred to see historical footage and photography to go with that, although some relevant still images were produced for the closing credits. It’s a sensitive and respectful portrait. • Iorram (Boat Song) is released on 5 March on digital platforms.
Hero's welcome: Liam Neeson to greet audiences for his new film in New York	As cinemas in the US start to reopen, distributors and exhibitors are hoping to coax audiences back in front of screens with promises of enhanced safety, unmissable movies – and a personal welcome from the stars. Liam Neeson will personally greet cinemagoers who go and see his latest action thriller, The Marksman, at the AMC Lincoln Square in New York’s Upper West Side before screenings on Friday. “This is one for the diary,” Neeson told the Hollywood Reporter earlier this week. “It will be nice to welcome people. I think going to the cinema is a bit of a sacred experience. I’ve felt that way since I was a kid.” Neeson, 68, also confirmed that he had received his first dose of a coronavirus vaccine. New York is the second-largest market for moviegoing in the US, following Los Angeles, where cinemas remain closed. San Francisco’s screens have recently been given the all-clear to reopen with other cities on the west coast are thought to be not far behind. New York’s cinemas will be limited to 25% capacity, with a maximum of 50 people in each screening room. “The reopening of New York is a strong symbolic gesture to the theatre-going audience that it is okay to put your toe in the water,” said Tom Ortenberg, chief of Open Road/Briarcliff, which is distributing The Marksman in the US. The film opened in a number of territories around the world in January, where it has taken $16.4m to date. In a poll released on Thursday, the US’s National Research Group suggested moviegoer confidence is now at its highest level since last summer. Studios are capitalising on this sentiment, with a number moving planned release dates forward, following a year of postponements. The Peter Rabbit sequel, original scheduled for release in February 2020, has moved to 14 May 2021 from 11 June 2021, while the followup to A Quiet Place, which had been set for March 2020, moves forward from this September to 31 May. AMC is the largest cinema chain in the US. All of its 13 venues in New York will reopen on 5 March, with the Regal chain, which is owned by Cineworld, said to be opening an April reopening. Plans for cinema reopening in the UK remain contingent on the roadmap out of lockdown remaining unchanged. But current guidance means indoor cinemas in England would be allowed to reopen from 17 May, while outdoor cinemas would be permitted from 12 April. There is currently no date for reopening for cinemas in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Coming 2 America review – Eddie Murphy makes a right royal turnaround 	Thirty years have passed since the wedding to end all weddings closed Coming to America, John Landis and Eddie Murphy’s 1988 blockbuster comedy about an African prince who travels from the fictional African kingdom of Zamunda to New York to find a bride. A funeral lineup to rival Glastonbury occurs in the first act of this sequel, proving that the people of Zamunda still know something about spectacle. Co-written by Kenya Barris (Girls Trip) and directed by Craig Brewer (Hustle &amp; Flow, Dolemite Is My Name), this follow-up reverses the first film’s fish-out-of-water plot, with Murphy’s Prince Akeem and sidekick Semmi (Arsenio Hall) returning, briefly, to Queens to retrieve Akeem’s secret “bastard son” Lavelle (Jermaine Fowler). The comedy doesn’t work quite as well this way around, though Fowler is extremely likable as a sweet-natured slacker, channelling the endearing guilelessness of Murphy’s original Prince Akeem. Still, there are enough in-jokes and returning characters to keep fans happy (admirers of Randy Watson and his band Sexual Chocolate needn’t fret). A flashback involving Lavelle’s mum Mary (Ghostbusters’ Leslie Jones) and a pumpkin spice scented candle made me bark with laughter. The film proudly celebrates a wide swathe of Black culture; there’s a throwaway gag about cult TV sitcom Benson, a cameo from 90s R&amp;B group En Vogue, and gorgeous Ankara-print costumes designed by Ruth E Carter (Black Panther). In Zamunda, a woman cannot succeed to the throne or own her own business. To redress the original’s dated gender politics, Akeem’s three daughters (played by KiKi Layne, Akiley Love and Murphy’s real daughter Bella) challenge the sexism baked into their culture. It’s perhaps a milder film as a result, though its efforts feel sincere rather than pandering. • Coming 2 America is on Amazon Prime
Notturno review – a poetic critique of war in the Middle East	In this striking documentary, Italian-American film-maker Gianfranco Rosi (Fire at Sea) explores the aftermath of war in the Middle East, filming Iraq, Kurdistan, Syria and Lebanon over a three-year period. Rosi’s method of patient observation allows him to make poetic connections across borders; a military drill that takes place at dawn is juxtaposed with a group of grieving mothers who wander an empty prison in an orderly procession. With no intervening text or voiceover, it can be hard to discern the individual locations and their different political contexts. Instead, Rosi’s broader critique of violence is implied through footage of a play performed by patients in a psychiatric hospital, and of a children’s art therapy class. He is more interested in the reverberations of conflict than the source, focusing on those who have suffered its effects directly. • On Mubi
Raya and the Last Dragon review – dazzling Disney animation	Disney’s latest offering casts Star Wars’ Kelly Marie Tran as the voice of its south-east Asian princess protagonist, the sword-wielding Raya. Her mission is to unite all five pieces of a broken gem containing dragon magic, as well as the fictional Kumandra’s divided regions, in order to defeat a swirling purple plague called the Druun. There is an incandescence and a buoyancy to the animation that elevates the formula. Husky-voiced comedian Awkwafina (The Farewell, Crazy Rich Asians) is captivating as cuddly water dragon Sisu, her goofy earnestness in the same league as Eddie Murphy’s Mushu or Robin Williams’s Genie. • On Disney+
Fukushima 50 review – simmering tribute to power-plant heroes	Dangerously high concentrations of politeness are observed in this dramatisation of the 2011 disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Not only do most of the heroic “50” left behind to avert nuclear catastrophe constantly apologise for underperforming in acts of barely believable self-sacrifice, at one point a manager begs forgiveness for refusing to allow two employees to re-enter the radioactive zone after a failed first attempt. To the feckless western mind more likely to view Homer Simpson as the standard-issue nuclear power-plant employee, it’s a relief when – just for a second – a few Fukushima workers contemplate running away. It is possible director Setsurō Wakamatsu has taken the Hollywood route in portraying the staff as so infallibly courageous – though Fukushima 50 is adapted from journalist Ryusho Kadota’s book, which investigated the response to the earthquake and tsunami in more than 90 interviews. Possibly to avoid lawsuits from Tokyo Electric Power Company executives portrayed here as selfish and shamefully caught on a back foot, everyone in the film is fictionalised – except for prime minister Naoto Kan, though he is never referred to by name, and plant manager Masao Yoshida. Yoshida crucially defies orders and allows the reactors to be cooled with seawater – which prevented meltdown and the possible devastation of Japan’s entire eastern seaboard. The reactors also must be “vented” for pressure manually by workers agonisingly selected for the task. Played by Ken Watanabe as a man having the ultimate bad day at work, the simmering Yoshida looks in need of a similar intervention. Wakamatsu treats his account of these critical hours – the first direct depiction of the disaster, though Sion Sono’s Himizu (2011) was a poetic first responder – like a machine to be kept running at all costs. Often it consists of little more than technicians pelting into crisis rooms, adhering to the Akira school of screaming, with shocking gas-pressure read-outs. The civilian backstories are token, and though the film is critical of the brass, it doesn’t let this anger break into climactic outrage. Yoshida died in 2013 of unrelated oesophageal cancer: Watanabe’s big-shouldered presence makes this an ample tribute to the man, but the film could have been more than an easy clap for his workers. • Fukushima 50 is available from 8 March on digital formats.
Time's Up criticises HFPA over Golden Globes diversity plan	A plan launched by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association to improve diversity in its membership and bolster the credibility of its Golden Globes awards has been met with scepticism by Time’s Up, one of the film industry’s leading activist organisations. The HFPA released a statement on social media on Sunday announcing “transformational change”, in the wake of stinging criticism before and during the 2021 edition of the Golden Globes a week ago. The organisation pledged to appoint an “expert in organisational diversity, equity and inclusion”, to add “Black and other underrepresented professionals to [the] organisation”, and to improve “transparency” over its voting and membership processes. However, Time’s Up responded immediately, accusing the HFPA of having dragged their feet “for decades”, and questioning the organisation’s commitment. In a statement on social media, Time’s Up said: “On behalf of the many artists who look to us to hold the HFPA’s feet to the fire on the racism, disrespect, misogyny, and alleged corrupt financial dealings of the Golden Globes, we need to see specific details, timetables for change, and firm commitments. The right words are not enough.” According to Deadline, Time’s Up has applied pressure on NBC, the source of the HFPA’s main revenue stream via lucrative payments for broadcasting the Golden Globes, to ensure significant changes take place.
The Humorist review – a comedian crumbles as the USSR collapses	It’s 1984: the USSR is on the verge of collapse, and so is Boris Arkadiev (Aleksey Agranovich), a fictional standup who has enormous mainstream success but crumbles under bouts of insecurities. A failed novelist, Boris now tours the country with a banal routine about … a naughty monkey. The KGB approves and the audience roars with laughter, but Boris merely simmers with apathy. Boris’s problems lie in his political spinelessness. His friends chastise him: Simon (Semyon Steinberg), an outspoken writer, mourns Boris’ idealistic literary past; Max (Yuri Kolokolnikov), an actor enamoured with American culture, concludes that the comedian should defect. Adding to the horrors, Boris’ teenage son writes anti-communist rock tunes in a bedroom plastered with posters of David Bowie and T Rex. This failure to communicate reaches a surreal peak when Boris is summoned to perform his routine to a Russian astronaut in space. In one long restless take, Boris paces around a sparsely furnished bunker and breathlessly tells the same old jokes, only for the astronaut to tell him to stop. He has had enough. Boris has, too. This distinctive tendency to mix the weariness and the absurdities of life in the USSR makes The Humorist highly watchable. Agranovich’s performance is outstanding: his body language is subtle, but the actor has a magnetic way of sparking disillusionment or defiance in a simple look. Funnymen with a dark side can make for a great movie – think Lenny or Man on the Moon – but as a rule, the jokes must land; here they just aren’t funny enough. Even when Boris finally snaps and delivers scathingly uncensored jabs at Soviet officials in a bathhouse (another absurdist touch), it falls a bit flat. That’s a shame, as otherwise this is a intriguing time capsule of Soviet history. • The Humorist is released on 12 March on Your Screen.
A Colony review – kisses and cliches in tender coming-of-age debut	This is a gorgeously gentle feature debut by the Canadian film-maker Geneviève Dulude-De Celles: a calm and tender portrait of a shy 12-year-old as she yo-yos between childhood and adolescence. It is beautifully acted and full of emotional complexity, although at times the storytelling seems a little derivative, with scenes half-familiar from indie’s back catalogue of coming-of-age movies. Emilie Bierre is lovely as Mylia, who is so painfully self-conscious that she hides in a toilet cubicle until the bell rings on her first day at a new school. Mylia lives in the sticks with her parents and younger sister Camille, a little scamp who sits at the breakfast table shoving cereal up her nose (played by newcomer Irlande Côté, who lights up the screen every time she appears). There’s a pang of sadness seeing the two girls together: Mylia leaving behind happy-go-lucky girlhood for what looks like a fragile anxious period of being a teenager. And the world is in a hurry to make her grow up, to sexualise her. One of the popular girls (Cassandra Gosselin-Pelletier), takes a shine to Mylia, inviting her to a party where there’s alcohol and a boy who likes her. (He’s got the shifty look of having just watched two hours of porn on his phone.) A much better option is Jimmy (Jacob Whiteduck-Lavoie), a soulful, long-haired kid in Mylia’s class; he is of Abenaki descent (though a subplot involving racism towards First Nations people at school feels a bit unthought-through). The script sensitively shows why her choices are a big deal. Which boy will be her first kiss? Should she party with the cool clique? Mylia is creating the blueprint for her identity as a teenager. It’s mostly an engrossing watch, but occasionally generic: these first experiences are pretty universal but feel a little reprocessed. Still, what an impressive debut. • A Colony is released on 15 March on Mubi.
Los Conductos review – a cryptic Colombian parable	This challenging Colombian parable feels like it could have been made in the 1970s, what with its cryptic storytelling, spiritual musings and vivid imagery, all shot on grainy 16mm. Rejecting conventional narrative structures, its story takes some decoding, and may well defy comprehension, but its striking visual language, with vibrant colours, sparse compositions and free-associative editing, casts quite a spell. Our protagonist is a bearded, long-haired young vagrant named Pinky (Luis Felipe Lozano), whom we first find shooting a man, stealing a motorbike, then getting high in an abandoned warehouse. It transpires he has recently left a cult and has killed its leader. We never see the cult in question, but in voiceover we learn of the hold its leader had on Pinky and other outcasts: “We had been miraculously saved from a world that had always seen us as worthless.” Fragments of Pinky’s experience are presented with little distinction between real and imagined. He spends time at a counterfeit T-shirt printing workshop. He recounts the tale of a beggar addict who believes they’re in a parallel world underground. He strips copper wire from buildings. He has a bewildering encounter with a man (who may be an incarnation of the cult leader) in a forest, where it is unclear who is going to kill whom. There are echoes here of Chilean auteur Alejandro Jodorowsky in the disorienting stew of metaphor and mysticism, and the sheer logic-defying strangeness of it all. Lozano even bears a physical resemblance to Jodorowsky in his head-trip classic The Holy Mountain. But director Camilo Restrepo seems less concerned with psychedelic spiritual questing than commenting on Colombia’s real social and political decay. The film ends with a poem by Gonzalo Arango (which could be a key to deciphering the entire exercise) that asks: “When will Colombia stop killing its sons?” Oblique and impenetrable as it is, it’s a memorable experience. • Los Conductos is available from 11 March on Mubi.
My English Cousin review – searching doc about a man between two worlds	Algerian-Swiss film-maker Karim Sayad has here created a sweetly indulgent portrait of his “English cousin” Fahed: a pudgy, smiley, good-natured guy sloping about the place in his England shirt, someone whom you can easily imagine as a little boy. Twenty years ago, Fahed came to the UK from Algeria illegally and started out sleeping rough. Now, with a frustrating and burdensome existence in Grimsby working two jobs in a factory and a kebab shop and estranged from his English partner, he has a yearning to return to Algeria to be close to his mother. He even claims that there is an Algerian woman back home who wants to be his fiancee. Sayad follows Fahed back to the old country, where the prodigal son finds a warm but tense situation. Fahed’s mum and his aunt are affectionate but exasperated at Fahed’s evasiveness on the subject of this woman to whom he’s supposed to have proposed: he doesn’t sound excited to be getting married and we never actually see his intended. Will Fahed settle back down in Algeria? It’s doubtful, for the simple reason that the people that he really seems to like – he lights up in their company – are his mates back in Grimsby, the lads that he shares a house with and goes to the pub with. This is an opaque film; for all the directness of Sayad’s film-making style, there is an awful lot Fahed is keeping back from us. He won’t really open up to his mum or his aunt, and Sayad himself isn’t going to break cover and ask questions. The film leaves it up to us to decide whether or not Fahed’s decisions are the right ones. • My English Cousin is released on 12 March on True Story.
How to Stop a Recurring Dream review – Ruby Barker lends class to kidnap thriller	There are some strong ideas and sharply observed family dysfunction drama in this feature debut by documentary maker Ed Morris. But none are enough to stop the film sinking into silliness, with a highly implausible abduction followed by a road trip across the South Downs. Bridgerton’s Ruby Barker plays troubled 19-year-old Yakira, who lives with her dad, his second wife and her lairy 12-year-old half-sister Kelly (Lily-Rose Aslandogdu). Family life is an emotional battlefield in their suburban semi, the two girls constantly at each other’s throats. Yakira resents the way their parents ignore Kelly’s nasty nickname for her: “No mum.” The whereabouts of her birth mother isn’t revealed until later on, but Barker’s compelling performance hints at a childhood trauma that has left Yakira feeling adrift in the world, vulnerable and impulsive. One night, after an explosive family row, Yakira kidnaps her sister while she sleeps. The logistics of this are the film’s first major plausibility lapse: is it actually possible to lift a 12-year-old out of bed, down some stairs and into a car without waking her up? Anyway, the plan is to take Kelly across the South Downs to visit Yakira’s mum. But when Kelly wakes up and flips, Yakira locks her in the boot. The police – called by their worried parents – launch a surprisingly well-resourced manhunt. Things go from bad to worse for Yakira when she accidentally picks up a hitchhiker (Andre Flynn). He looks like he’s walked out of a village hall production of Brideshead Revisited with a white suit, floppy hair and boarding-school sneer. Actually, he’s a drug dealer – and with his arrival the movie sinks into contrivance, increasingly forced and silly. Still, nothing can rub the shine off Barker’s huge talent; she is totally authentic even if the film is half-baked. • How to Stop a Recurring Dream is released on 9 March on digital platforms. • This article was amended on 12 March 2021. The actor who plays the hitchhiker is Andre Flynn, not Adam Hugill as an earlier version stated.
'Snyder cut' of Justice League accidentally released on HBO Max	The long-awaited “Snyder cut” of the superhero movie Justice League was accidentally released on streaming service HBO Max on Monday, before being removed. According to the Hollywood Reporter, customers who were attempting to access the new Tom and Jerry movie found that instead the service played Zack Snyder’s Justice League, which is due to be released on 19 March. One user reported on social media that more than an hour of the film (which has an official run time of 242 minutes) was screened. The new version was created after a fan campaign that began after the release of the original film in 2017, to unimpressed reviews. It starred Ben Affleck as Batman, Jason Momoa as Aquaman and Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, who team up to battle supervillain Steppenwolf. Snyder, the film’s credited director, left the project in May 2017 during postproduction, following the death of his daughter. Joss Whedon, who had co-written the film’s script and directed Marvel superhero films The Avengers and Avengers: Age of Ultron, took over the and reportedly set up extensive reshoots. After the film was removed from HBO Max, takedown notices were reportedly sent to social media users who had posted screenshots of the film.
Martyr review – masterful, visceral study of grief	Grief is a contradictory emotion: an intangible state of mind, while inducing overwhelming physical responses. Mazen Khaled’s masterly Martyr strikes the right balance as it simultaneously grounds the act of grieving in the real as well as the abstract. On a hot summer day in Beirut, Hassane (Hamza Mekdad) is restless. He lives with his parents who constantly nag him to get a job. Even his masturbation session in the shower is interrupted by his father grumbling about water waste. Dreaming of being submerged in the ocean, Hassane tries to find release at the seaside with his friends, equally aimless loafers who complain about stifling Beirut and their dire romantic prospects. Hassane, in a moment of bizarre clarity, climbs up above the rocky beach and takes a fatal dive. His body crashes into the water and suddenly, all that visible is sea-foam. Hassane doesn’t come up again. Like death, grief, too, is a kind of crash. Suddenly, Martyr erupts into freeze-frames. They capture Hassane’s body stretched out and gently carried by numerous pairs of arms and hands, as his friends bring him home. The moment death enters Hassane’s household, everyday life is irretrievably disrupted, and the film veers into experimentalism. At one point, Hassane’s mother (Carol Abboud) is seamlessly teleported to a black limbo where she and other female mourners grieve in the form of dance. In other hands, such stylistic choices might come off as gauche, but here they are cathartic; the mother’s devastating disbelief is violently exorcised. In Martyr, life and death are linked through such gestures. Moreover, while the sexual orientation of the men is unclear, there is a homoeroticism in their touch that nurtures Hassane from his adulthood to his sudden death. Grief can also be sensuous; that the same hands which have sunned with Hassane on the beach are now washing him for his final rites is pure cinematic poetry. • Martyr is released on 12 March on digital platforms.
Sacrifice review – pagan fjords of misrule	Writing-directing collaborators Andy Collier and Tor Mian’s follow-up to their well-received debut, cops-and-Satanists Charismata, constructs a classic fish-out-of-water premise by sending a wholesome average American guy, Isaac (Ludovic Hughes), and his heavily pregnant wife, Emma (Sophie Stevens), to a remote Norwegian island to claim a house Isaac has inherited. There, they find that the locals are pagans, that all dreams are bad and tentacled monsters lurk not just in the sea but also down the drain. So maybe that makes this a fish-in-the-water story. Or you could call it an invertebrate-in-the-water, if you want to be as pedantic as the Norwegian bartender who almost starts a fight with Isaac over the nature of calamari in one of the early scenes. Either way, the quirky script, adapted from a short story by Paul Kane and, as the opening credits assert, inspired by the work of HP Lovecraft, is quite good on the cultural friction between Americans and Europeans. It draws very deep from the well of uncanny associations that come with horror stories set in northern Europe such as The Wicker Man and Midsommar. Add this one to the mix and we almost have a mini-genre: you could call it Doggerland Gothic. Sacrifice’s contribution to the canon is notable, throwing in anxieties around a Nordic tendency towards madness brought on by long nights, northern lights, aquavit and too much skinny-dipping in icy waters. Collier and Mian have a lot of fun with nightmare fakeouts, casting doubt on what’s real and what’s a dream; together with the coloured gels used in the cinematography, this gives the whole thing a 1970s giallo vibe. Just to ice that cake of dried blood, the lovely Barbara Crampton, doyenne of classic horror films such as Re-Animator and From Beyond, is on hand as the local policewoman/high priestess, serving up menace with the pan-fried trout. • Sacrifice is released on 15 March on digital platforms.
The Winter Lake review – a damp Irish mystery	A strong setup is constrained by limited resources – financial and possibly creative –in this gloomy thriller set in damp rural Ireland. The story begins on a macabre note: gangly, troubled teenager Tom (Anson Boon) discovers a sack in a shallow lake containing the bones of a human baby. The lake is on the land of the rundown farmhouse he has just moved into with his mother, Elaine (Charlie Murphy), who looks young enough to be his sister. They clearly have their own baggage: Tom’s past behaviour is blamed for their relocation. The fresh start turns even sourer when they meet their nearest neighbours: grizzled farmer Ward (Michael McElhatton) and his teenage daughter Holly played by Emma Mackey, star of teen series Sex Education; she holds her own with the Irish accent, but this does little more for her CV. They, too, have their family baggage, it soon transpires. Tom’s mother is at first flirtatious with Ward, inviting him in for a whiskey at the first opportunity. Holly strikes up a parallel friendship with Tom, despite the fact he is withdrawn to the point of being almost mute. Her ulterior motives are not difficult to fathom after she spots the sack of bones in his possession. But then nobody is really being truthful in this claustrophobic situation, which allows in little in the way of trust or genuine affection. Things start off sombre and get darker, literally as well as tonally. The crisp cinematography and eerie score build up some tension, but with so few principal characters, the mystery of the baby is not difficult to solve, and a few too many plot contrivances lead to an anticlimactic resolution. There’s promise here but also perhaps some uncertainty: ultimately it falls between the stools of realist rural drama and full-on horror. • The Winter Lake is released on 15 March on digital platforms.
Verdict review - empathy and urgency in convincing domestic abuse drama	Justice is not delayed but could still be denied in this arresting Filipino movie, which tracks a case of domestic abuse with such conviction, it is often easy to forget it’s staged drama rather than documentary. The first half-hour is especially frantic and immersive as it begins with the assault in question. Hard-up Manila mother Joy (Max Eigenmann) is preparing supper for her young daughter, Angel, in their cramped, cluttered little apartment. Her husband Dante (Kristoffer King) returns home drunk. A violent argument quickly erupts, in which Joy is brutally beaten and Dante slashed on the arm with a knife. As the police and women’s protection services intervene, we’re pitched almost in real time through the Manila night: down streets, through homes, into and out of vehicles, through police stations and to a clinic, swept along by agile, up-close, handheld camerawork. Adding to the trauma, Joy and Dante are dealt with practically side by side throughout. Calm mercifully prevails for a spell after Joy presses charges, although the demands of the Filipino justice system mean each side must gather their own witnesses and negotiate various circles of bureaucratic hell – still conducted through piles of paperwork. The eventual trial is gripping but infuriating: we’re in no doubt that childish, semi-criminal Dante is the guilty party, but his family enlists a smart lawyer who runs rings around the overstretched public prosecutor. There is an ironic twist to this particular case, but is clearly a drop in an ocean of domestic abuse that goes unreported or unpunished. The overall impression is of a legal system more concerned with expediency than justice: chaotic, rushed, patriarchal, under-resourced and open to abuse. Director Raymund Ribay Gutierrez, a protege of local auteur Brillante Mendoza, directs with empathy and energy here; he’s a name to watch. • Verdict is released on 12 March on digital platforms.
Mouthpiece review – double the drama in doppelganger story	Why have one actor play your lead character when you could have two? That’s the central conceit of this distinctive Canadian indie, written by the actors in question, Amy Nostbakken and Norah Sadava, and adapted from their stage play. They are both Cassandra, a disorganised woman in Toronto thrown into crisis by the death of her mother. Unlike movies with similar conceits – Luis Buñuel’s That Obscure Object of Desire, for example, where two actors alternated in a role – Mouthpiece keeps both women on screen at all times. As a reflection of a fractured mental state, it’s an effective device, although the relationship is not sharply defined. Sometimes they are like best friends or sisters, in playful internal dialogue; others they are in good cop/bad cop opposition, or even conflict. Sometimes their movements are identical (they trip over their scarves in synch, for example); at others they appear to be autonomous. The comic potential of the setup is largely sidestepped although a highlight is a scene where one Cassandra chimes in with distracting criticisms while her other self is trying to have sex with an old flame. As the Cassandras traverse snowy Toronto, making preparations for the funeral, flashbacks fill in a difficult mother-daughter relationship. Mother (Maev Beaty) was a smart, free-spirited, Joni Mitchell-loving divorcee, who has clearly transmitted her resentments and anxieties to her daughter. Female identity and its construction from within and without are to the fore, albeit from a certain perspective: as one Cassandra points out to the other: “You’re a white, thin, middle-class, educated, hetero Canadian.” It’s directed by Patricia Rozema, who is possibly best known for her 1999 risk-taking adaptation of Mansfield Park; it doesn’t quite escape its roots in experimental theatre. The story occasionally verges on self-indulgent (or rather, selves-indulgent), but it is playful and ingenious. • Mouthpiece is released on 12 March on digital platforms.
An Impossible Project review – life after digital in forward-looking retro doc	Here is a documentary about the resurgent interest in retro culture that comes across like a warm fuzzy blanket of nostalgia for pre-Covid days. The central figure is “Doc” Florian Kaps, who the film presents as Vienna’s answer to Steve Jobs, a social visionary untroubled by such details as earning a living or indeed running a functioning business. Kaps’ speciality is what he calls “analogue”: physical hardware such as manual switchboards, jukeboxes, printing presses, and the like, made obsolete by the rise of laptops and smartphones. At the start of the film, Kaps’ attention is caught by the failing Polaroid camera, and – seemingly on a whim – he agrees to take over the company’s last factory, in the Netherlands. (We are not told much about his finances, other than the occasional arrival of tech investor types who pop up whenever needed.) It soon becomes clear that Kaps’ visionary utterances (“What does Facebook smell like?”) are no match for a solid business plan, and after a few years of trying fruitlessly to replicate Polaroid’s instant film, Kaps is ejected from his own company when a former intern becomes CEO after bringing in his own investor father. Kaps is not daunted after this cautionary experience, and applies his roving mind to, first, a cafe/gallery called Supersense, and later to hotel keeping; his tech contacts come in handy for the latter as he appears to get backing from Facebook’s Analog Research Lab to restart operations at a giant mothballed Overlook-type place called Sudbahnhotel. It’s never clear exactly what roles Kaps has in any of these activities, or how he earns money, but he is genial company and makes a persuasive case for life beyond the digital realm: making an astute observation that, where once analogue businesses tried to convert to digital, digital companies are now getting interested in the real world. Of course, this was all filmed pre-Covid, during which the power of digital technology has asserted itself like never before. It’s possible that Kaps’ enthusiasms may have foundered by the time the pandemic recedes. • An Impossible Project is released on 15 March on digital platforms.
The Columnist review – middle class writer on a murder spree	To paraphrase Nietzsche: gaze too long into Twitter, and Twitter will gaze into you. Anyone who writes for a living on the internet has surely fantasised about payback time for all the keyboard warriors, callous below-the-liners and unrepentant trolls out there. Ivo van Aart’s movie gives full rein to that desire and is snappily directed – but in the end there is something self-satisfied and sententious about his feminist revenge flick. Katja Herbers plays Femke Boot, a newspaper columnist drowning in internet misogyny, especially after she steps out of her usual lifestyle remit to write an op-ed about Zwarte Piet, the Dutch blackface folkloric character. Her book publisher is pressurising her for juicier material to better compete with author-of-the-hour Steven Dood (Steven Death), a kohl-rimmed provocateur who savages her on a chatshow. Umbilically fed by her phone on a diet of shitposter abuse, she finally snaps when she realises her neighbour – partial to some Zwarte Piet himself – is one of her tormentors. As her serial-mom killing spree gets under way, Van Aart drapes a couple of complementary plotlines around it: her daughter Anna (Claire Porro) is fired from the school newspaper and, via the medium of F-bomb-loaded banners, fights a battle for free speech. And when Femke ends up in bed with Dood, it turns out his gothic bad boy persona is just a pose, and he is actually keeper material. These aspects hover soberly around the themes of free expression and online identities – but dilute the black comedy Van Aart attempts to operate with elsewhere. There is some nice absurdist carnage, such as middle-class mum Femke creeping along a gutter to tip a neighbour off the roof in her inaugural murder. But the humour isn’t sharpened to a fine point, leaving each new death to bludgeon in The Columnist’s thesis with the blunt end: online life has robbed us of the ability to appreciate nuance and difference. Femke’s graduation to monster lacks the delicious irony it’s shooting for, as a few plot-logic slips en route – why leave uncleaned weapons around for others to discover? – betray Van Aart’s haste to get his opinion out there. • The Columnist is released on 12 March on digital platforms.
Come True review – blow-out imagery in visionary sleep disorder thriller  	There is something visionary about this near-nonsensical, kitsch but atmospheric techno-thriller from Canadian director Anthony Scott Burns. Drawn along on dark somnambulic rhythms, it incorporates elements of fantasy, horror and 80s synthwave aesthetics without giving itself over completely to any of them. A wordless first 10 minutes introduces us to Sarah (Julia Sarah Stone), a runaway student apparently unwelcome or unwilling to return home, waking in spectrally lit parks and falling asleep in coffee shops. Dropping suddenly into surrealistic CGI dreams that track inexorably towards a demonic figure who, if approached too closely, wakes her with a start. Sarah decides to try to climb out of this insomniac bath by enrolling in a university sleep study. It is overseen by Dr Meyer, a Cronenbergian academic in big glasses, but run by a trio of researchers who, like the memory technicians in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, have a loose relationship with scientific protocol. Becoming close to Jeremy (Landon Liboiron), she learns that they are using pioneering technology to observe the subjects’ dreams – and that the same shadowy presence manifests in all of them. But Burns doesn’t pursue this supernatural lead where you would expect, committing instead to a dream-logic that mostly abrogates him of plot duties. Acting as his own cinematographer and editor, he puts together a blow-out of imagery with great technical skill that fleshes out this waking dream of a film. Sarah watches her dream self in Jeremy’s mind’s eye on the monochrome monitors, which later melds into a stylised aquamarine-flooded sex scene that is like a Michael Mann wet dream (a debt acknowledged by the use of Shriekback’s Coelacanth, the spine-chilling tune from Manhunter). Talking is beside the point – and, with Stone adept at mute trepidation, it often feels that way even when there is some dialogue. As for interpreting what it all means, leave that to Burns’s therapist. The flamboyance on display here, though, promises great things. • Come True is released on 15 March on digital platforms.
Stay Out of the F**king Attic review – secrets are laid bare in efficient horror	Ex-con Schillinger (Ryan Francis) has been out of the big house long enough to start up his own business as a removal man, and has just hired two more employees, also prison alumni: tough Imani (Morgan Alexandria) and her friend, soft-spoken new father Carlos (Bryce Fernelius). All three have pasts they would like to put in the rear-view mirror of the moving van. But an offer from a creepy old man (Michael Flynn) with a German accent to do a quick overnight cash job will expose each person’s dark secrets and vulnerabilities, including piquing their perfectly natural curiosity when he tells them to shift everything in the mansion but stay out, per the title, of the attic. And the basement for that matter, but presumably director Jerren Lauder and his producers agreed Stay Out of the F**king Attic and Also the Basement wasn’t such a snappy title. Of course, the employer’s command sets the movers in motion and it all comes out: Nazi pasts, monsters, and one unfortunate mover’s eyeball in a particularly gruesome interlude. Strictly in terms of generating jumpscares and gross-out moments this is efficient enough as a cinematic machine, but the script credited to four different people including Lauder hasn’t got a lot of finesse or subtlety. Even for allowing that horror films set in spooky old houses are supposed to be full of dark shadows and blackness, this is especially gloomily lit, so viewing on laptops is not recommended. Tension relieving laughs are few and far between, except for unintended guffaws that might be generated when one character skins part of their own anatomy; but the actor does such a poor job of expressing pain it looks like they merely stubbed their toe. • Stay Out of the F**king Attic is released on 11 March on Shudder.
The Adventures of Wolfboy review – charm and vulnerability in magical realism fable	Broken into arch chapter headings that are introduced with intricate, stylised illustrations like something out of a book of fairytales for Gen Z and millennial misfits, this fey, magical realism fable is an interesting mixture of winning charm, smug knowingness and vulnerability. The screenwriter (Olivia Dufault), one of the young co-stars (Sophie Giannamore from Transparent) and the character she plays are all transgender, and the film is at its best when it is working through issues around dysphoria through the lens of allegory. That feeling of not being at ease in your own body is at the heart of this story about a 13-year-old named Paul (Jaeden Martell, heartbreakingly expressive even under a ton of prosthetics and fake hair) who has a condition that causes him to grow lustrous golden-red fur all over his body, including his face. Teased by peers at school, and already dealing with major abandonment issues after his mother ran off when he was little, he can’t even count on his well-meaning but clueless dad (Chris Messina) to do the right thing. One day Paul runs off to find his mother in that mythical land known as Pennsylvania. Along the way, he briefly becomes a freak show attraction at a carnival run by the menacing if mesmerising Mr Silk (John Turturro, going over the top, round the outside and up from underneath with an outrageously hammy performance); and then falls in love with a beautiful singer around his own age named Aristiana (Giannamore), whose dreary mother insists on calling her by her dead name “Kevin”. First time director Martin Krejci draws lovely performances from his cast, and the whole thing looks dreamy and splendid thanks to Andrew Droz Palermo’s cinematography – but the last act could have done with some serious workshopping to smooth out the motivational kinks and deflationary resolution. Still, it might be the kind of film a kid wrestling with their identity will treasure forever, flaws and all. • The Adventures of Wolfboy is released on 15 March on digital platforms.
The Little Things review – plodding serial killer thriller	If it didn’t plod quite so tamely in the footsteps of films such as Seven and Zodiac; if Rami Malek had chosen to use more than one facial expression in his performance, then perhaps this overly familiar tale of obsessed cops and serial killers might feel less stale. As it is, it’s about as fresh as a bloated, bile-tinged corpse dredged from the Los Angeles river, with a markedly similar colour palette to boot. As deputy sheriff Joe Deacon, Denzel Washington’s shuffling gait and round shoulders belie a sharp mind that is wasted in the quiet backwater where he now works. Sent to LA, his old stomping ground, Joe is confronted by former colleagues less than thrilled to see him, and by his successor Jim Baxter (Malek), who is about as wholesome as it’s possible to be in a job that involves scrutinising corpses on a daily basis. Initial hostility warms into mutual respect, as the two men bond over the investigation of a series of murders. John Lee Hancock, who wrote as well as directed the film, is no David Fincher, but his use of colour is bold: green is threaded through The Little Things like a trail of clues – the eyes of a victim, the pistachio paintwork of a suspect’s car, the throbbing emerald of Joe’s hotel room breakdown. But as the detectives start to lose the plot, so does the film, fizzling into an unravelling tangle of loose ends. • On multiple VOD platforms
Mouthpiece review – two women, one tale of grief	Following the death of her mother, Cass is falling to pieces – a fact that this adaptation of an inventive stage play explores through the device of having two actors simultaneously playing the same character. Norah Sadava and Amy Nostbakken wrote the play and jointly star as Cass; Nostbakken also contributes the film’s haunting and rather lovely score. I wonder if the dual performance might have had a more forceful impact in the stage incarnation; nevertheless, the film is undeniably potent in its account of the shattering force of grief. Available in virtual cinemas and on demand
Locked Down review – Anne Hathaway and Chiwetel Ejiofor are suitably trapped	In the right hands, storytelling within a framework of restrictions can lead to thrillingly inventive film-making – think the Dogme films, with their vow of creative chastity, or single-location thrillers such as Gustav Möller’s The Guilty or Steven Knight’s Locke. Knight wrote the screenplay for this Covid-19 drama, but the tale of a struggling marriage – Anne Hathaway and Chiwetel Ejiofor are suitably mismatched – pushed to breaking point by the first pandemic lockdown is worlds away from the lean cinema of limitation of Locke. Instead, the film busts a gut attempting to free itself from the confines of the couple’s home. In this, it’s at least true to the spirit of lockdown, but it feels like a missed opportunity. • Available on multiple VOD platforms
Reunion review – Julia Ormond wows in slow-burn Kiwi horror	Reunion is a two-in-one horror treat, serving up a scary mother and a spooky old house full of secrets. Evil mums are terrifying and pleasurable in equal measure; reflecting our intergenerational angst while pushing the same dynamic to spectacular heights. Here, Julia Ormond’s deliciously passive-aggressive matriarch delivers both campness and genuine unease. Reunion sees the return of Ellie (Emma Draper), an academic studying black magic, to her New Zealand childhood home. Heavily pregnant, Ellie longs for a quiet weekend to focus on her work, but such hopes are dashed by the presence of her domineering mum Ivy (Ormond) who is packing up the furniture in anticipation of the house’s sale. Like her namesake, Ivy is poisonous, pampering Ellie only to immediately criticise her every move. The atmosphere is claustrophobic, littered with moving boxes as well as unresolved childhood traumas; the decor only enhances this tension with stifling flowery wallpapers a direct contrast to the black gunk oozing from the kitchen sink. Underneath all the prettiness, something is clearly rotting: as Ellie wanders through the corridors of her youth, her repressed memories come flooding back: death, betrayal, unspeakable secrets, darker than any gunk. Reunion is admirably patient: instead of jumpscares, it is more interested in creating an ambience of perverse disquietude: slides of bloody magic rituals, flickering home videos, even brief experimental closeups of internal bodily fluids. These choices initially appear cryptic, but they all come together in the film’s last stretch in a gory, kaleidoscopic spectacle of family trauma. Ormond’sperformance is stunning – she has a magnificent line involving boiling a cauliflower – and there are some truly sublime visual moments. Even if it’s one of those films where the parts are a lot better than the sum, Reunion is sure to linger in the mind. • Reunion is released on 22 March on digital platforms.
A Coach’s Daughter review – low-key betrayal on the teen tennis circuit	Lukasz Grzegorzek’s A Coach’s Daughter is an interestingly downbeat movie, veering away from the big scenes and obvious crises that other films with the same idea might have given you, and yet somehow serving them up in different forms. It’s about the intense and borderline inappropriate relationship between a middle-aged tennis coach, Maciej (Jacek Braciak) and his teenage daughter Wiktoria (Karolina Bruchnicka), who is a budding tennis star. He is driving her all over Poland, where they are competing in summer regional tournaments, and hoping for glory; they share hotel rooms and lounge around together in intimate states of undress like a couple, but appear utterly focused on Wiktoria’s training and fitness. On the road they meet Igor (Bartlomiej Kowalski), a bright young teen male star of this tatty circuit, and Maciej offers to let him tag along and to coach him. Clearly, some sort of emotional betrayal is in the offing, especially as Wiktoria and Igor make a rather handsome couple; there is a real chemistry between them, and Wiktoria could well be sick of this monomaniacal discipline. But Maciej has his own secrets and his own emotional needs. Could it be that it he is going to transfer his passion and quasi-parental concern to Igor, the son he never had, and someone who might actually have a better shot at Wimbledon than Wiktoria? A Hollywood version of the same idea might have had both Igor and Wiktoria each building up to a big match and confronting parallel crises; this isn’t what happens here and it’s notable how Grzegorzek skates over the drama of what happens on court. And a different type of movie might have addressed the audience’s unease about the possibly transgressive relationship of Maciej and Wiktoria, but this film coolly declines to let things go that way. A Coach’s Daughter finds its low-key way of controlling the drama. • A Coach’s Daughter is released on 19 March on YourScreen.
While We Are Here review – enigmatic study of romance is hard to love	Here is a thought-experiment of a movie from Brazilian film-makers Clarissa Campolina and Luiz Pretti: it’s a dramatic essay, or docu-fictional romance, or perhaps the cinematic equivalent of an epistolary novel, and it has been much admired on the festival circuit. But intriguing though its premise is, I couldn’t really make friends with this film. Two characters meet in New York and fall in love, but we never see them (though we maybe glimpse them). We do however hear their voices on the soundtrack, musing and commenting. One is Wilson (Marcela Souza e Silva), a Brazilian migrant worker who is in fact about to return to Brazil due to worrying news from home; the other is Lamis (Mary Ghattas), a Lebanese single mum. What we see is the city around them: ambient streetscapes. But it is not true to say that we see what the characters see, because, in this sense, they never see each other or catch sight of themselves in any mirror. We hear their voices, and also that of a central narrator (Grace Passô), but these voices are strangely unanimated. The actors simply read aloud what are evidently Wilson and Lamis’s thoughts, or possibly journal entries, or emails to each other, which are musing and ruminative. The line-readings are weirdly detached and toneless, and there is a disconcerting absence of passion, or even recognisable emotion in these maundering speeches. Finally, Lamis and her child go to Berlin where she has a scholarship and Wilson goes to Belo Horizonte in south-east Brazil; and Campolina and Pretti capture the street-scenes there as well, in the same way. The ending is as enigmatically emotionless as everything else. There is sincerity here and a formal consistency, but there is something obtuse and thin about it all. While We Are Here is released on 19 March on True Story.
Assault on Station 33 review – Nicolas Cage's son dials it up as supervillain	Although the title invokes John Carpenter’s 1976 classic Assault on Precinct 13, one of the all-time great pulpy siege movies, this tale of a hostage-taking at a Veterans Administration hospital in Buffalo, NY, is all pulp, no greatness. In fact, the premise is not so much about an assault as an infiltration that one fortuitously skilful character, who just happens to be around at the time, accidentally foils when the bad guys threaten his wife and child’s safety. In other words: Die Hard, but with a teensy budget that appears to have mostly been used on a visual effect that makes the many shots of bullets entering bodies look like puffs of red dust exploding like scarlet glitter bombs. It’s quite distracting in its shabbiness. Sean Patrick Flanery stars as Jason Hill, a version of Bruce Willis but with more hair and less comic timing. He’s a former soldier whose wife Jennifer (Gina Holden) works as a therapist treating PTSD patients. While waiting in the hospital building for her to finish treating a high-ranking general (Gerald Webb) while their daughter (Sarah Elizabeth Jensen) waits in the parking lot, Hill notices that some of the workers supposedly there to fix a broken elevator, as well as some unfamiliar security guards, are acting kind of hinky. That’s because they’re all bad guys working for Rabikov (Weston Cage Coppola, son of Nicolas Cage): a Russian terrorist who wants to exchange the general and the lives of the hostages he and his minions capture for his brother, who is being held by the US authorities. Coppola’s year-old-Époisses-ripe performance, sporting a surprisingly convincing Russian accent, is one of the more amusing features of this film which is otherwise a fairly bog-standard opportunity to dish out regular doses of gunfire and fisticuffs. • Assault on Station 33 is released on 15 March on digital platforms.
Nest of Vampires review – a bloodless bid for the title of worst film ever	There are bad movies, the kind of third-rate film-making we see all the time, and then there are transcendentally bad movies that can only result from deep, fanatical attachment to the material. Director, writer and producer Chris Sanders here achieves something on a par with Ed Wood’s Plan 9 from Outer Space or Tommy Wiseau’s The Room. His Nest of Vampires is a little-England horror-thriller with a plot as over-larded as an Elvis sandwich, uniformly appalling acting, and the same almost beatific earnestness as those two legendary films. MI5 agent Kit Valentine (Tom Fairfoot) leaves his London stamping ground to shake down some unnamed English town for a human trafficking ring that – after his wife is murdered – has abducted his daughter. He needs to get a move on, because the network sells off the girls to moneyed clients to butcher in satanic rituals. Not racy enough? Some of the criminals are also vampires who like a “nibble” on the customers. And Valentine is further up against it when his bosses reveal they are in cahoots. Tied to a chair, though, he has news for them: “You’re not the only secret society that operates within MI5.” Then his own canines turn extra-pointy. For a film so full of brain-freezing exposition, it takes inhuman effort to piece that plot description together. It’s actually a nest of non sequiturs, randomness the only governing principle in a sinkhole of characters, factions, ideas and twists. A prologue refers to lapis lazuli as a means by which vampires can withstand daylight, but this is barely mentioned again. One apparently Italian miscreant – implied to be a vampire, before he isn’t – sounds like the Dolmio Man when he resorts to English: “Good-a point-a!” If criminal networks really were this confusing, the police would have a collective nervous breakdown. Hidden in the aimless scenes and slack direction is the odd nugget of dialogue with a noirish gleam. But mostly it’s pure panto: “I’m about to do a spot of decorating. I was thinking dark red would suit this room.” It may be remiss to dump on a film that cost £30,000, but it seems to be only this type of film-making that can hit a pitch of such sublime pap. Maybe one day Nest of Vampires will get its own Disaster Artist-style eulogy. • Nest of Vampires is released on 16 March on digital platforms.
Silk Road review – high-free account of the dark-web drugs emporium	Here’s an unthrilling, bland drama about the rise and fall of Ross Ulbricht, the mastermind behind the illegal online drug emporium Silk Road (described by the FBI as “the Amazon of drug sites”). Between 2011 and 2013, PhD dropout Ulbricht made millions of dollars in commissions from users on the dark web anonymously buying and selling drugs. Then he got busted. If you consider how gripping David Fincher made a bunch of geeks in hoodies talking about algorithms look in The Social Network, the Ulbricht story – involving an FBI manhunt and allegations of murder-for-hire – should be a doddle. But watching Silk Road is a bit like rolling a joint only to find the leafy green substance you’ve been sold is oregano. The highs just don’t come. It starts in 2013, with the feds swooping on 29-year-old Ulbricht (an insipid performance from Nick Robinson) at a San Francisco library. In flashback, he emerges as an unlikely Silicon Valley founder. He ticks some of the dotcom boxes (flip-flops, standup desk, rooftop yoga, breathtaking arrogance), but – unusually – he is a rightwinger. The film’s voiceover borrows from blogs he posted on Silk Road spouting his antigovernment libertarian ideals. Director Tiller Russell is clearly team Ulbricht, and a needy tone creeps into the script; it desperately wants us to like Ulbricht, even when he’s plotting to bump off an employee-turned-informant. Meanwhile, Jason Clarke’s role as a drug enforcement officer falls back on stereotypes of knucklehead, bash-down-the-door cops. He plays Rick Bowden, who gets reassigned to cybercrime (after a stint in rehab) to serve out his last nine months on the job behind a desk. But what do you know, his good old-fashioned police work reaches places that detectives with master’s from MIT can’t. “I’ve been locking up bad guys since before you started shaving your balls,” he growls at his boss. Maybe kingpins aren’t what they used to be. Perhaps millennials have taken the excitement out of organised crime. You won’t find much in this movie. • Silk Road is released on 22 March on digital platforms.
Josie & Jack review – shockingly lifeless incest drama	“Your dad kept you locked up in an old house,” a character drunkenly blurts out in this adaptation of Kelly Braffet’s gothic novel about childhood misery and brother-and-sister incest. “It’s soooo Flowers in the Attic.” If only! The most shocking thing about this movie is how stale and lifeless it is, as if entire scenes had been placed into a vacuum storage bag, zipped up, and sucked of all energy and human feeling. Set in the 1990s, it begins in rural Pennsylvania where 16-year-old Josie (Olivia DeJonge) and her older brother Jack (Alex Neustaedter) have been raised in a spooky old house by their physics professor father (William Fichtner). He’s a violent pompous drunk who homeschools the kids rather than sending them to “the idiot factory” local high school. In a few flatly acted scenes, he rants grandiosely about his university colleagues and hurls crockery at his children. Jack is a good-looking bad boy who instructs Josie to seduce the kid behind the counter of the local pharmacy so he can get his hands on prescription drugs. And Jack creepily paws at his sister, stroking her hair and walking into the bathroom when she’s in the shower. Director Sarah Lancaster’s script, co-written with Braffet, keeps the audience guessing right up to the end how far things have gone between them – but there is so little visible chemistry between the actors you may not care either way. Eventually, after a massive barney at home, the siblings escape, arriving penniless in New York where Jack attaches himself to an Upper West Side socialite, Lily – a brittle performance by Annabelle Dexter-Jones so good it deserves a better role. As for Josie, she is a disappointing non-character – often spotted with her nose in battered Kafka paperback to show she’s got a brain, but 90 minutes pass before she gets a chance to use it. Unintentionally, perhaps, the film is the story of monstrous men (a daddy dictator and controlling brother); the women are weirdly blank. • Josie &amp; Jack is released on 22 March on digital platforms.
Film industry celebrities boycott crisis-hit Golden Globes 	Film industry pressure on the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), the body that organises the Golden Globe awards, has increased after more than 100 public relations firms sent a letter telling the organisation they had withdrawn all their celebrity clients from activities with the HFPA until it made “profound and lasting change” to correct what it described as the HFPA’s “longstanding exclusionary ethos … discriminatory behavior [and] ethical impropriety”. According to Variety, the letter, signed by high-profile PR outfits including DDA, Premier, 42West and Rogers &amp; Cowan/PMK, was delivered to the HFPA on Monday, following continuing criticism of the crisis-plagued organisation. The letter reads: “We cannot advocate for our clients to participate in HFPA events or interviews as we await your explicit plans and timeline for transformational change.” “Anything less than transparent, meaningful change that respects and honors the diversity and dignity of our clients, their colleagues and our global audience will result in immediate and irreparable damage to the relationship between our agencies, our clients and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.” The Golden Globes TV broadcast is the HFPA’s most high-profile and lucrative event, and an industry boycott would be devastating. The HFPA’s troubles were sparked by a report in the LA Times shortly before the most recent Golden Globe awards show, in which the HFPA was accused of a lack of diversity in its membership as well as “ethical lapses” in the way it conducted its business. The organisation’s response, in which it said it would add “Black and other underrepresented professionals to [the] organisation” and improve “transparency” over its voting and membership processes, was deemed inadequate by high-profile film industry campaign group Time’s Up. The HFPA responded to the publicists’ letter with a statement in which it acknowledged it “should have done more, and sooner”, and said it would ensure that “at least 13 per cent of the membership be Black journalists” by the end of the year.
The Legend of the Stardust Brothers review – 80s Japanese bubblegum pop curio	A curio that’s lain dormant for many years since it first sashayed on to screens in 1985, this Japanese teeny-bop musical supports the argument that not all cult films need to be revived. Ultimately, some were flops the first time round for good reason. That said, lovers of Asian kawaii culture, camp and Japanese bubblegum pop, which all converge in this confection, are likely to be satisfied. Like so many of pop-tastic exploitation projects (see also the Monkees’ Head), the music comes first and the story splicing it all together a distant second. Musician-impresario Haruo Chikada composed the soundtrack of cheesy, synth-heavy bop and then hired director Makoto Tezuka (son of the famous manga artist Osamu Tezuka, creator of Astro Boy) to string the songs together into a script. Et voila, the confection they came up with this is a self-referential tale of two aspiring pop stars: temperamentally scratchy Shingo (Shingo Kubota) and cooler, albeit mulleted, pretty-boy Kan (Kan Takagi), who are brought together by a record company executive in order to create a commercially compelling duo. Marimo, a random girl they meet at the label’s headquarters, is drafted in to become the head of their fan club, before they even have much of a fan club to start. The songs, a glorious mishmash of genres ranging from sub-Joy Division post-punk to ska beats to moody new wave drones, are fitfully entertaining (with their poorly translated lyrics about topics including maxed-out credit cards, tomato juice and artistic ambition). But it’s all so clumsily assembled and herky-jerky, it gets more irritating than amusing over the long haul. The best bits are where it totally goes off into crazy-town with zombie monsters played by actors in latex masks and then back to (relative) reality as if nothing has happened. • The Legend of the Stardust Brothers is released on 18 March on Mubi.
Slaxx review – killer jeans horror-satire	The spirit of Roger Corman’s original Little Shop of Horrors lives again in this entirely ridiculous but often amusing and sharp horror-satire from Canadian film-maker Elza Kephart, set in an unbearably cool clothes shop, in which the sales assistants cruise around talking to each other with mic-headsets, but hardly deign to communicate with the customers. Romaine Denis plays Libby, a starry-eyed young woman who is thrilled to have got a job at this store, awed by its visionary CEO and by the company’s commitment to non-exploitative practices and its ethical attitude to the developing-world communities where the clothes are made and where the cotton is grown. But of course it is all nonsense. The company cuts costs with sweatshop contractors in south Asia, and the super-cool jeans that it is bringing in for its new line are in fact haunted by the vengeful spirits of those workers in India who have been injured and killed. And so, for the special evening in which these new garments are to be unveiled at the store to an elite of hipsters and Instagram influencers, the jeans themselves run amok in a bloody orgy of revenge against the first-world fashionistas. It is all very silly, and some of the script and acting are a bit broad (though perfectly consistent with the overall style). The scenes where the jeans come to life like malign reptiles and even start dancing on the shop floor are good; some videos over the closing credits cheerfully reveal the tech wizardry that created these effects. An entertaining skewering of the hidden global politics in retail trendiness. • Slaxx is released on 18 March on Shudder.
Preparations to Be Together for an Unknown Period of Time review – Blow-Up in Budapest	Here is a puzzle or a riddle of a psychological movie, with distant echoes of Roeg’s Bad Timing or Antonioni’s Blow-Up. A brilliant and beautiful Hungarian neurosurgeon, Márta (Natasa Stork), abandons her career in the United States just shy of her 40th birthday and returns to Budapest. And why? Because she has met a handsome compatriot at an academic conference: János (Viktor Bodó) is a fellow surgeon who romantically arranged to meet Márta at a certain time and date at the city’s Liberty Bridge. But János doesn’t show up, and when Márta tracks him down and confronts him, he merely says with an air of baffled politeness that they have never met. Márta takes a job in Budapest and rents a certain scuzzy apartment because it has a view of the now totemic, or cursed, bridge and begins to stalk János online, even uncovering a video of him as a child winning a singing competition with an arrangement of Schubert’s Trout Quintet. But her career still prospers, with brilliant diagnoses and masterly surgeries, which intrigue János. So what is going on? Is János lying? Is Márta delusional? Or is this her kind of obsession-based “magical thinking” – has Márta imagined what she wants in the future, and made an unconscious decision to behave as if it is the case, forcing the facts to rearrange themselves around her wishes, like iron filings around a magnet? The paradox of the film’s narrative procedure is that it is shown from her point of view, not János’s, and yet it is Márta’s account that the audience is tacitly invited to challenge. The movie can’t quite match the drama – and the shock – of János’s denial of Márta at the very beginning, and the ending ties things up a little neatly. It is at once a relief and an obscure disappointment that the mystery is not left enigmatically unsolved. • Preparations to Be Together for an Unknown Period of Time is released on 19 March on Curzon Home Cinema.
Killing Escobar review – the hard men behind  plot to kill drug lord	Here’s a documentary that shines a light on squalid corner of British post-imperial legacy: the batches of mercenaries – largely former military personnel – who roamed the world’s trouble spots in the 70s and 80s, killing for hire in numerous civil conflicts in Africa and Latin America. (As this film suggests, these ex-SAS types weren’t politically neutral: they were actively keen on killing communists in places like Angola and Rhodesia.) The film focuses on an escapade that is – ethically speaking – a little less murky than cold war Africa: a plot to assassinate the super-powerful Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar in the late 1980s. However, since it was organised at the behest of another super-powerful Colombian drug lord, any claims to the moral high ground are not really supportable. The principal interviewees here are Peter McAleese, a former paratrooper who grew up in Glasgow and was responsible for the military activities of the assassination squad, and the somewhat more dapper David Tomkins, the man who organised the contracts and who by his own account moved enormous amounts of arms into conflict zones. McAleese and Tomkins relate the story of their mission efficiently enough. We know it is doomed to fail, as history tells us Escobar was shot dead a few years later, in 1993, by a Colombian police unit. Presumably to crank up the narrative tension, director David Whitney adds a series of reconstruction-flashback scenes of McAleese, alone and injured in the Colombian rainforest. With little signposting, they slow down the film’s momentum, even if we eventually learn where they fit in in the bigger scheme of things. It all seems rather affable until a shipment of weapons turns up: the gun lust on show underscores the abhorrent nature of the enterprise. Rather like a veteran ex-football hooligan, McAleese is heroically frank about his propensity for violence as he fills in his backstory, offering up as evidence his rough Glaswegian upbringing next door to Barlinnie prison (he points out the cell window from which his hardman father would signal when he was doing time). On some level, McAleese’s scorn for his former self is a reasonably creditable attempt to confront the consequences of the destruction he has caused, even if there is an evasiveness about the way he focuses on failings in his personal life rather than his victims, in Africa or elsewhere. At 79, he’s still a scary individual. • Killing Escobar is out now on digital platforms.
Russian Raid review – hostile takeover of screens in steroidal martial arts actioner	Russia’s hooligan set will have a new Friday-night post-pub favourite with this martial arts film, modelled on Gareth Evans’s The Raid. In a literal hostile takeover, former Spetsnaz sniper Nikita (Ivan Kotik) leads a squad of tracksuited casuals into a vodka factory/mafia front on behalf of a shady businessmen (Ilya Antonenko) looking to seize it – but he also has a personal beef with the owner. For reasons half-explained, the squad are forbidden from carrying guns, and the chief heavy (played by real-life MMA fighter Vladimir Mineev) chafes against Nikita’s command from the off. They work their way up through the factory’s security to the C-suite, with much fisticuffs, mostly in the fashionable MMA style – with heavy emphasis on grappling and backhanded slaps that look prissy but probably aren’t. The standout is a corridor-hemmed brawl against three juggernauts wielding a host of medieval weaponry, with director Denis Kryuchkov often keeping us locked in with the combatants with swaying, reeling Steadicam. But introducing firearms halfway through, when the factory’s true owners enter the fray, works to somehow lower the stakes. As more parties become involved, the already poorly defined relationships between the characters become get more confusing – including what white-suited secretary (Sofya Ozerova) is doing there other than providing openings for misogynistic jeopardy. (She’s given an empowering assault rifle later.) The initial tone of impish mayhem shifts into something grim and rote, ill-serving frontman Kotik. Interestingly lithe, aloof and not overly macho, he has obvious star chops – breaking out in some fights into footwork drawn from the Russian folk dancing he does in one childhood flashback. “Balletic” used to be the adjective of choice for John Woo’s action films, and Kotik is clearly primed to deliver this in material that is more than this steroid party. • Russian Raid is released on 22 March on digital platforms.
Amber and Me review – a moving portrait of a girl with Down’s syndrome	Here is a humane and undeniably moving documentary about Amber Davies, a girl with Down’s syndrome, filmed over four years as she enters and moves up the school system. An hour in length, and released to coincide with World Down Syndrome Day, it examines her progress through three linked but separate perspectives, bringing together moments of beauty and joy as well as the harsher realities that not even childhood can escape. Olivia, Amber’s neurotypical twin, is a constant presence, showing great maturity, helping her sister with daily tasks and taking time to understand her. We also hear directly from her via voiceover; she doesn’t hide how she feels when she believes her sister has been unjustly treated, and articulates her hopes that Amber will be able to stay in the same school as her. The second perspective belongs to Ian Davies, Amber’s father and the film’s director. A largely off-screen presence, Davies is clearly a loving and encouraging father; it would have been interesting to hear directly from him. But the repeated scenes in which Davies visits his daughter’s play-shop are a nice touch, establishing atmosphere where we can observe Amber’s development for ourselves. Amber’s perspective, of course, takes centre stage, a valuable corrective to the current mire of neurodivergent-as-plot-device in mainstream cinema. The film reminds us that Amber is a fully realised individual, with interests and feelings to explore: she wall-climbs with her father, bakes with her sister and demonstrates an emotional complexity that most media would not appreciate. As the film progresses, we can only root for Amber, happy for her advances and feeling her pain when things stall. A labour of love in the most accurate sense. Amber and Me is released on 21 March on digital platforms.
Creation Stories review – generic biopic of record label supremo Alan McGee	“Bottom line, it was fun,” says self-declared Glaswegian ginger bastard Alan McGee (Ewen Bremner). Poolside in LA, the music executive reflects on his label, Creation Records, which ran from 1983 to 1999 and produced acts including the Jesus and Mary Chain, Primal Scream and Oasis. Suki Waterhouse plays a journalist profiling McGee, a framing device that should, in theory, allow the film to rollick through his formative moments and skip over any boring bits. It’s not unfun, exactly, to watch McGee going on an ill-advised coke bender with a sleazy film producer played by Jason Isaacs, ingratiating himself with Tony Blair (James Payton) and taking advice from an occultist (Steven Berkoff) he hallucinates at a house party. Yet the frenetic pacing, intended to sweep the audience along, can’t draw attention away from Irvine Welsh and Dean Cavanagh’s platitude-riddled script. Their key message, to “be a rebel, always”, as underscored in a Trainspotting-lite speech that closes out the film, feels oddly generic.
Oleg review – the tale of a Latvian trapped in Belgium	There’s a welcome streak of black comedy running through Latvian director Juris Kursietis’s second feature, which follows a young Latvian immigrant as he struggles to establish a new life in Belgium. In many ways, Oleg’s (Valentin Novopolskij) situation is sobering. He is unfairly dismissed from his job at a meat-processing plant after a colleague loses a finger. His living situation is precarious and at the mercy of villainous Polish landlord and mafioso Andrzej (Dawid Ogrodnik). And despite a new gig as a roofer, he can’t seem to get paid. A day trip to Ghent to visit Hubert and Jan Van Eyck’s altarpiece, The Adoration of the Mystic Lamb, finds Oleg haunted by his grandmother’s insistence that its sacrificial lamb is hopeful, not sad. The film refuses to get bogged down in the bleakness of Oleg’s predicament, with Kursietis’s irrepressibly lively handheld camera emphasising his protagonist’s sense of perpetual forward motion. Ogrodnik’s performance as landlord Andrzej, a charismatic smooth-talker who seduces Oleg with promises of Fifa matches and free food in a kind of frat house for migrants, lightens things too. In one scene he teaches Oleg to fire a gun in the woods. “You are ready now,” he declares, as a terrified Oleg misses his mark, the bullet just skimming his shoe. • On Mubi from 23 March
Banksy Most Wanted review – adulatory greatest-hits profile of the graffiti kingpin	Here is a watchable, if slaveringly adulatory documentary profile of the yet-to-be-conclusively-identified artist, whose increasingly pricey work has spawned its own mini-industry of blokes with angle grinders chopping stencils off walls and doors almost before the paint is dry. Directed by Seamus Haley and Aurélia Rouvier, this film covers most of the bases: beginning with the 2018 shredding of his Girl With Balloon painting shortly after it had sold at auction, and working back through earlier greatest hits such as the Dismaland theme park, the Walled Off hotel in Bethlehem in the West Bank, and the Mobile Lovers gift to a Bristol youth club. It also very much bends the knee, allowing statements such as “Banksy is the Picasso of the 21st century” to pass through unchallenged; others may not subscribe entirely to this point of view. In lieu of much biographical information, quite a lot of the film is given over to entertaining speculation on Banksy’s identity: Massive Attack’s Robert del Naja, Tank Girl/Gorillaz illustrator Jamie Hewlett, and someone called Robin Gunningham, are all put forward as plausible candidates. (At one point a serial killer investigator gets involved; the vagueness of his conclusions doesn’t bode well for the state of the US justice system.) The backstroking and raptures do get a bit much, but the counterweight is provided by arguably the most interesting talking head: art dealer Robin Barton, who unembarrassedly talks about how he (legally) removed a number of artworks with the help of said angle-grinders – but met his Waterloo when wall-ownership issues scuppered the “preservation” of a stencil cut out from the side of an amusement arcade in Folkestone. (Though I am not quite sure how one commentator can stand up the idea that the picture was owned “emotionally” by Folkestone’s local population.) Well, even if you don’t sign up to Banksy’s genius, it’s fair to say he’s harnessed social media like no other artist, using it to authenticate his work, preserve his anonymity, and document his stunts – all of which has helped to inflate the monetary and cultural value of his output. And if Banksy wants to be the Keyser Soze of contemporary art, that’s his affair. It certainly sells tickets. • Banksy Most Wanted is released on 22 March on digital platforms.
Shortcut review – five go on a gory getaway	Shot in Italy, with an English cast, there’s a crisp, almost fairytale levity to Alessio Liguori’s horror adventure that sits oddly but not unworkably with its gorier elements. It’s not quite clear exactly where it is set: perhaps actually in Italy, as the group of five youngsters being escorted on a red vintage bus are from an international school. Bantering with their driver, the party are jumped by a gun-toting convict when they stop to clear a dead deer off the road. But when the bus halts in a tunnel, with a shrouded shape huddled in front of them on the tarmac, they realise there’s worse out there. Liguori and writer Daniele Cosci don’t do much more than establish the character types of this Breakfast Club of teenagers: normals Nolan and Bess, swotty Queenie, joker Karl and bad boy Reggie. Not getting bogged down in interpersonal relationships means giving freer rein to the basic claustrophobia of their predicament, as their vehicle is menaced by a bulbous-headed beastie that looks a bit like William Blake’s Ghost of a Flea on crack. But Shortcut is not really tense: there’s a presiding zaniness that is almost cartoonish, with Zander Emlano’s Karl – whose lazy charm makes him the standout performer – especially game for screaming straight to camera. It’s one “yikes” away from being Scooby-Doo. Despite a rush of backstory when the gang hunker down in an abandoned fort and discover a cache of newspaper cuttings, the storytelling is a bit too scant and the runaround with the monster a bit too silly. But, delicately shooting all three environments – woods, bus and underground tunnels – with skin-prickling intensity, Shortcut retains a fresh edge. There is still the question of who the film is for: the close encounters with the pucker-mouthed parasite are too intense for kids. Maybe precocious tweens, or adults who are still afraid of the dark. • Shortcut is released on 29 March on digital platforms.
That Cloud Never Left review – experimental ruminations on cinema and labour	An artful hybrid of documentary and fiction, That Cloud Never Left zooms in on quotidian life in Daspara, a small West Bengal village where toys are made from reels of discarded film footage. The iconography is clear: these pieces of film are filled with nostalgia and longing, and now bear witness to the beauty and toil of manual labour. On the surface, That Cloud Never Left appears structurally fragmented, even opaque. There is an opening title that states that this is a work of fiction rather than a documentary; it is actually quite cheeky, considering that narrative is not a priority here, nor are any professional actors used. Instead, the film ditches linearity, and sees the villagers in fragments: a marital dispute over finances, a mother who waits for the monsoon, a boy searching for rubies in the forest. This mix of mundane life and magical daydreams lends an otherworldliness to this little village, as if the content of the cut-up film strips has seeped into everyday life. In visual terms, That Cloud Never Left is just as eclectic and experimental, alternating between straightforward scenes of toy-assembly with scans of the discarded strips where the images are scratched and intelligible. The sound mix contributes, too: the landscape murmurs, a static-heavy score disrupts, and the news on TV speaks of war and unrest, as well as an imminent eclipse. Out of the blue, dialogue and songs from old Hindi films sneak in. The symphony of these elements is exhilarating enough, but there’s more to be mined. The scrap film footage travels from wealthier Indian cities to be dumped on poor villages such as Daspara for recycling, meaning That Cloud Never Left becomes something more than a stylistic exercise in experimentation and nostalgia; there’s a hard economic reality here. • That Cloud Never Left is released on 26 March on True Story.
The Drifters review – grating post-Brexit romantic drama	Here is a French New Wave pastiche that, like many others, emulates the style but retains none of the charm. The Drifters tries hard to blend the aesthetics of those 1960s classics with pressing issues of migration and racism. Alas, the poorly sketched characters render the film’s social concerns superficial at best and tone-deaf at worst. The Drifters follows a whirlwind romance between Fanny (Lucie Bourdeu), a French waitress, and Kofi (Jonathan Ajayi), an undocumented Senegalese migrant. After a meet-cute in an English class in London, Kofi sweeps Fanny away on a half romantic, half literal getaway trip to the seaside. Kofi has committed a robbery in exchange for an Irish passport – a better option than a British one in a post-Brexit world – and he is now on the run from both his boss Doog (Joey Akubeze) and the police. Like many Nouvelle Vague heroines, Fanny loves addressing the camera and breaking into dance. Unfortunately, such behavioural quirks swiftly become insufferable: she turns to the audience to muse on how she eats a lot but stays thin, and how commercials used to be so much better because of all the sex and violence. The Drifters is clearly clueless about the delicate dynamics of interracial romance: Fanny’s “cute” jokes with Kofi, which include asking if he has explosives in his bag and a “black people don’t swim” tease are downright mind-boggling. Even worse, the film has included a reprehensible trope in which Kofi befriends and redeems a white man (played by Jonjo O’Neill) who hurls racist abuse at him. In the end, Ajayi is The Drifters’ only saving grace; his heartfelt, sincere performance is the single beacon of substance in a stylish but hollow work. • The Drifters is released on 12 March on YourScreen.
Black Widow headed to Disney+ as studio shakes up schedule	Disney has announced that Black Widow and Cruella will both be debuting on its streaming service Disney+ at the same time as in cinemas. The Marvel adventure and 101 Dalmatians prequel had both been intended for traditional theatrical releases but with the box office still underperforming, the studio has made the decision for a hybrid release. “Today’s announcement reflects our focus on providing consumer choice and serving the evolving preferences of audiences,” said Kareem Daniel, chairman of Disney’s media and entertainment distribution. Both films will be part of the platform’s premier access service, which requires users to pay an additional $30 rental fee, the same model used for Mulan and, most recently, Raya and the Last Dragon, which some US exhibitors have refused to show because of the simultaneous release. Box office intake has slowly started to increase in the US, with cinemas reopening in New York City and Los Angeles, the two biggest markets in the country, but many national locations still remain closed and capacity limits mean that attendance remains low. The studio has also announced that Pixar’s summer film Luca will eschew any form of theatrical release in territories with Disney+, headed straight to the platform for no additional cost. The same strategy was used in December for Soul. Other films moved back by the company include Marvel’s Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, now opening in September, and the Agatha Christie adaptation Death on the Nile, now being released in February 2022. Cruella, starring Emma Stone as the titular villain, will be released on 28 May while Black Widow is scheduled to premiere on 9 July. The Scarlett Johansson adventure was initially scheduled for 1 May 2020 but has seen a number of shifts because of Covid-19. The news comes after Disney claimed its latest Marvel series, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, was its most watched Disney+ series premiere yet, beating The Mandalorian and WandaVision. The studio recently reported that the platform has over 100 million users in just 16 months of operation.
Take Back review –  dusty martial arts thriller looks cramped	Clearly intended as a leg-up in the ranks of the female action star for Gillian White, this smalltown revenge thriller starts off well but takes a fatally long time to gather momentum. White plays Zara, a successful lawyer in a desert town whose martial arts skills, courtesy of lethal-but-sensitive husband and dojo partner Brian (Michael Jai White, her real-life husband/trainer), make her a social media hit after she disarms a goon threatening a coffee-shop assistant. This lowlife is in fact part of a local human-trafficking ring, masterminded by chihuahua-loving hoodlum Patrick (Mickey Rourke), with links to Zara’s secret past. Any B-movie thriller worth its salt should get to its inciting incident within the first 20 minutes. Here, it’s the kidnapping of Zara and Brian’s daughter, and it takes nearly 50 minutes to arrive. The plot is jammed instead with portentous run-ins with Patrick’s thugs, leaden teasing-out of Zara’s history that hovers close to matinee melodrama, and only the sporadic justice-servings we are really here for. With a fierce crochet hook of a left eyebrow, White has a natural charisma and authority, and – with him indoors taking a back seat – ample room to strut them. Yet director Christian Sesma shoots her in a cramped way that prevents full butt-kicking glory, and she starts to become strangely decentred in her own film. Elsewhere, despite looking these days like a man trapped inside Mickey Rourke prosthetic makeup, Rourke has a rueful dignity in his few, largely static scenes that is hard to take your eyes off. • Take Back is released on 29 March on digital platforms.
Honeydew review – flame-grilled rural horror	A first feature from director of short films Devereux Milburn, co-written by Milburn and the film’s cinematographer-producer Dan Kennedy, this is a stylised, unsettling horror jaunt that plays interesting variations on an all-too-familiar plot premise. Sam and Riley, a good-looking couple in their 20s, played respectively by Sawyer Spielberg (yes, son of Steven Spielberg) and Malin Barr, takes the always foolish decision to leave the safety of the city for a camping trip. In this case, they elect to pitch their tent somewhere in rural New England because Riley is working on a doctoral thesis about a (fictitious) fungal infection in wheat that causes gangrene and madness in cows and people. However, they soon get run off their campsite by the local farmer (Stephen D’Ambrose), and a flat car battery forces them to seek help at the cluttered homestead of elderly Karen (Barbara Kingsley), a keen baker and cooker of meaty steaks, and her mute, brain-damaged son (Jamie Bradley). The city slickers soon find themselves at the mercy of ravenous desires; but on the plus side, all the TV sets seem to be perpetually tuned to the last station in the world showing nothing but old black and white Popeye and Betty Boop cartoons from the Inkwell Studios’ heyday in the early 1930s, a glorious period in animation, and a good match for the body horror that’s about to be revealed here. With a running time of 107 minutes, the film goes on just a little longer than it really needs to before it gets predictably violent, grotesque and reasonably scary at last. But Milburn and Kennedy certainly know how to build a unique atmosphere, using liverish lighting schemes, cantered camera angles, unsettling split screens, misleading editing and above all a truly disturbing soundtrack that combines source noise with composer John Mehrmann’s musical score – a mix of synthesizers, unsettling percussive bongs and bubble pops, and what sounds like a theremin having a very bad day. • Honeydew is released on 29 March on digital platforms.
Stray review – exquisite dog's eye view of Istanbul	At last, just what world cinema really needs right now: an exquisitely made film about street dogs in Istanbul, satiating that universal desire to see distant lands, coo over beautiful, noble animals, and satisfy the audience’s need to feel guilty about the misfortune of poorer, unluckier people. Director Elizabeth Lo’s first feature-length documentary ticks every box, while also providing a companion piece to Kedi, Ceyda Torun’s equally wonderful ode to Istanbul and Turkey’s feral felines. Together, the two films would make the perfect night in of viewing for quarantined animal lovers with frustrated wanderlust, especially anyone who loves the magnificently grotty Bosphorus metropolis. Filmed seemingly with a low-slung camera held for great chunks of the running time at dog-head height, the film follows a gaggle of orphans both canine and human whose paths intersect and converge. A trio of Turkish-speaking refugees from Syria live in squatted building sites and doorways, and the camera stands back and watches while they huff glue from bags and space out. The actual protagonist is a yellow mutt named Zeytin, a Labra-something cross probably, with the most soulful eyes you’ll see in any movie this year. Dragging a slightly crook leg and sometimes palling up with dog friend Nazar – a dark, stockier lady of a certain age – Zeytin hangs with the Syrian boys and then saunters off to look for food when the fancy takes her, queen of the road, blithely unconcerned about cars. The spliced-in grandiloquent quotes about dogs and philosophy and whatnot from Diogenes that pepper the film aren’t really necessary; the action speaks for itself. Perhaps because the star species here is more biddable and less camera-shy than the average cat, Lo’s film stays closer to its non-human heroine than Kedi did, creating a more lyrical, less anthropological study. That poetic vibe is richly enhanced by composer Ali Helnwein’s keening, cello-centric score that’s nimbly synched up to the editing. That said, nothing tops the vocal performance from Zeytin herself at the end, howling hauntingly along with a muezzin’s call to prayer. • Stray is released on 26 March on digital platforms.
Oleg review – migrant drama of despair leaves no way out	Here is the second feature from Juris Kursietis, a Latvian film-maker working in a toughly questioning European social-realist style. Valentin Novopolskij plays Oleg, a young migrant worker from Riga working in a meat processing plant in Ghent, Belgium. A grisly accident means that he is danger of losing the job and getting deported, but poor, biddable Oleg falls under the sway of a sinister Polish gangmaster called Andrzej, who genially offers to get him a fake Polish passport and fix him up with cash-in-hand building work with all the other eastern European illegals . They are all living together, drinking and playing Fifa in a house that they are supposed to be remodelling – but the mercurial and voluble Andrzej is in fact terrorising them like an abusive stepfather and using them in violent crime. Andrzej is played by Dawid Ogrodnik, whom I last saw as the sax-playing hitchhiker in Paweł Pawlikowski’s Ida. This is a bleakly uncompromising film, shot in a handheld manner, the camera shakily following Oleg closely around in the streets, the building sites and the various chaotic and squalid interiors. But it’s leavened with a kind of black comedy: Oleg ends up having sex with a young woman during a somewhat unlikely interlude, by conning his way into a private party and pretending to be an actor, and the realism is interspersed with dream-like and religiose sequences. Interestingly, movies like this about the marginal, the exploited and the dispossessed usually have a young woman at their heart rather than a man, and this shows how there is a very masculine sort of humiliation and despair in Oleg’s heart. He has a connection with Andrzej’s abused girlfriend, Małgosia (Anna Próchniak), and it is easy to see how Oleg’s life is playing out in a kind of gender-switch parallel to hers. I’m not sure I quite believed the way in which this story is played out, but there is an abrasive energy to it. • Oleg is released on 23 March on Mubi.
Violation review – a torrent of suppressed rage 	In Violation’s closing stretch, Miriam (Madeleine Sims-Fewer) sits numbly in a rain-lashed car and watches a man harangue his wife in an eastern European language. Miriam has just done something unspeakable, in reaction to something unforgivable; preparing to finish the job at an anonymous motel, it is as if she has crossed a border into a foreign country. But the couple in front of her show the inescapable constant: male violence. Building to a remorseless climax, Sims-Fewer and co-writer/director Dusty Mancinelli brilliantly, and times almost unwatchably, overhaul the rape-revenge movie as something far more realistic, traumatised and noxious. Miriam has come from London to visit her sister Greta (Anna Maguire) in the Canadian forest idyll she shares with husband Dylan (Jesse LaVercombe). But tension is in the air: in Miriam’s faltering marriage with Caleb (Obi Abili), in her jealousy of her sister, even in the disturbing flashes of nature – pond lice seething on the lake – that open the film. Able only to unburden herself to the seemingly matey Dylan, Miriam stupidly kisses him by the campfire; then when she is sleeping, he rapes her. Sims-Fewer and Mancinelli don’t show this event immediately, opting for non-linear disorientation that cuts between that night and a later hook-up in a log cabin in which Miriam ties Dylan naked to a chair, and asks for his side of the story. What follows is possibly the most brutal woman-on-man ordeal since Audition. But there is nothing triumphal about it; this isn’t some fantasy spree, just a single abject act of reprisal. The violence, and the torrent of suppressed rage and disgust it unleashes, are appalling. When the rape is finally shown, it is in tiny glimpses of chilled napes and heaving eyelids. Trying to utterly destroy Dylan’s body is Miriam’s response to the invasion of her own, and this corporeal tragedy plays out in Sims-Fewer’s staggering physical commitment to the role. Outside the motel, her face becomes a glistening mask; a fury in the classical Greek sense. Misogyny remains current, but this stony rejoinder – with nature shot as if out of kilter, or possibly amplified – feels like something from the ancient world. • Violation is released on 25 March on Shudder.
Nemesis review – geezer cliche compilation with a charisma bypass	If Towie put out a crime special it might look a bit like this shoddy London thriller about an ageing gangster whose plans for a peaceful retirement go south. The characters have that same style of stiff, awkward delivery, as if they’re speaking lines to each other over a dodgy Zoom link. The star is TV mainstay Billy Murray (The Bill and EastEnders) who plays John Morgan, a gang boss with the telltale mahogany suntan of a cockney hardman done good. Morgan, semi-retired in Turkey, flies into London on a private jet for a charity fundraiser. But on the night there’s a spot of bovver with an old foe, alcoholic detective Frank Conway (Nick Moran). Morgan and his wife Sadie (Jeanine Nerissa Sothcott) have also arranged a dinner to meet their Instagram influencer daughter’s new girlfriend – and there’s a horrifically sleazy scene when the girlfriend arrives early to find Sadie wearing only knickers. Murray plays villain Morgan with the menace of a bag of spinach wilting soggily at the back of the fridge – it’s almost as if his contract has stipulated a charisma bypass is a condition for the part. And everything is let down by the script, which feels cobbled together from geezerish cliches. “You’re like a British bulldog,” an associate growls at Morgan. “You’re proud, defiant, tenacious, old-school. But there comes a time in every animal’s life when it needs to be put down.” In the third act, the family dinner party turns into a home invasion nightmare that is an ordeal for all the wrong reasons. Meanwhile, copper Conway is downing whiskies in a gentrified East End boozer, getting all riled up for revenge. A twist at the end of the meal is ludicrous. In cockney rhyming slang, this is pony and trap. • Nemesis is released on 29 March on digital platforms.
The Banishing review – Jessica Brown Findlay shines in standard spooker	“An empire of misogyny” is how former Irish president Mary McAleese described the Catholic church – and Christianity as a historical perpetrator of sexism and violence against women adds an interesting-ish layer or two to this otherwise run-of-the-mill but well-acted haunted-house horror. It’s set in the runup to the second world war and loosely inspired by Borley Rectory, the country manor once dubbed “the most haunted house in England”. Downton Abbey’s Jessica Brown Findlay is terrific as Marianne, a vicar’s wife with a rebellious streak (her bohemian “loose woman” past becomes crucial later). Marianne has just moved into a crumbling pile in the Essex countryside with her wet blanket husband Linus (John Heffernan) and their young daughter Adelaide (Anya McKenna-Bruce). The local bishop Malachi (John Lynch), a man who wears the huge gold cross around his neck like gangster’s bling, is clearly not to be trusted. And pretty soon things are going clank in the night. The film’s scares feel pretty standard, with nothing new to add to the gothic haunted house canon. Marianne hears voices wailing in the walls; her daughter finds a creepy Victorian doll with gaping black holes where its eyes have been gouged out. Nevertheless, director Christopher Smith turns the screws with malevolent precision: scenes in which Marianne and little Adelaide see their doppelgangers reflected in a mirror are genuinely unnerving, as are Marianne’s violent hallucinations. It all gets very silly, and there’s a naff go-nowhere storyline involving Nazis. But Brown Findlay holds it together with her performance of Marianne as the sort of woman who marches no-nonsense into the dark basement brandishing a torch to take on the ghosts of mad monks. • The Banishing is released on 26 March on digital platforms.
Feedback review – Eddie Marsan thriller on the wrong frequency	This contrived, nasty and uninteresting horror-thriller is a waste of its star Eddie Marsan. He plays Jarvis Dolan, a late-night radio presenter of lefty views, sort of like James O’Brien, with a bit of Piers Morgan’s provocation. His career is in crisis, having only just survived a kidnapping from a shadowy group of Brexity rightwing extremists. The station’s oleaginous boss Norman (a cameo from Anthony Head) insists that Jarvis now lightens the broadcasting mood by getting reunited with his old double-act partner, Andrew Wilde (played by Peaky Blinders’ Paul Anderson), a boozy, jokey wild man that Jarvis can’t stand these days. But hardly have they got together for their first show than they are attacked by terrifying masked individuals who lock them in the studio, forcing them to stay on the air, because they are obsessed with a certain something in Jarvis and Andrew’s past. All the buildup turns out to be tiringly irrelevant to the attack itself, which revolves around an event from 10 years ago, in circumstances that don’t seem at all convincing for people who are supposed to be late-night radio presenters, not rock stars. The movie is supposed to deliver claustrophobic tension and thrills, a little like Assault on Precinct 13, perhaps. But there is a weird lack of plausible plot involvement, and also a disconcerting amount of implausible plot development. Who would have thought that a radio studio actually had a sort of trapdoor in the side leading to possible escape from the building? And then there are flourishes of horrible violence that don’t mesh with the rest of the film. You might find yourself tuning out. • Feedback is released on 26 March on digital platforms.
Six Minutes to Midnight review – Eddie Izzard miscast in strained Nazi-school yarn	Eddie Izzard, comedy genius and heroic campaigner for the European cause, is bizarrely miscast in a deadpan-serious acting role for this weird, strained, second world war spy melodrama inspired by a stranger-than-fiction true story. The transgender star switches back here to what Izzard has playfully called “boy mode” for a boy’s-own-story in the style of John Buchan or Erskine Childers, or maybe one of Michael Palin’s Ripping Yarns, though with the jokes and comic self-awareness systematically removed. It’s a muddled, unrelaxed tale from Izzard as co-writer and co-producer, whose dramatic gears keep slipping, and which is never entirely sure where our sympathies should lie. Izzard plays Thomas Miller, a teacher of Anglo-German ancestry who in the fraught summer of 1939 takes a job at the Augusta Victoria college in Bexhill-on-Sea, a kind of genteel finishing school for expatriate German adolescent girls; he is interviewed for the job by the naively pro-German English headmistress Miss Rocholl (with Judi Dench sleepwalking through the role). This extraordinary school really did exist throughout the 1930s, with a swastika discreetly sewn into its crest next to the union jack, and it was attended by the daughters and god-daughters of some very senior Nazis. Izzard imagines what might happen if, as war loomed, this place was the centre of a Nazi intelligence plot. A lively idea for a drama, but the sheer oddity of the real-life premise slows it down, and the film is unsure about whether we should see these teen blonde Mädchen pupils as Midwich-Cuckoo mini-Nazis or as poignant dupes. A spy story depends on secrecy and concealment, but this school is entirely open about its pro-German and pro-Nazi leanings from the outset. As for the character of Miller, he is supposed to be a real action hero, and there are loads of shots of Izzard running athletically and surreally away from the camera across open fields. The film itself runs out of breath. • Six Minutes to Midnight is released on 26 March on Sky Cinema.
Memories of My Father review – deeply felt memoir of Medellín's public-health champion	Javier Cámara is the Spanish actor with the gentle, open, everyman face who has been a stalwart repertory player for Pedro Almodóvar for around 20 years, particularly in the mysterious and beautiful 2002 film Talk to Her; Cámara unforgettably played Benigno, the nurse tending to a young woman in a coma, believing that he must always talk to her. Now he gives a wonderful richness and warmth to this very affecting movie, directed by Fernando Trueba; it is based on the true story of Héctor Abad Gómez, the Colombian public-health activist and prominent government critic who in 1987 was shot dead in Medellín by far-right paramilitaries. It is adapted from the 2005 memoir of Gómez by his son, the now prominent Colombian author Héctor Abad Faciolince, entitled El Olvido Que Seremos (which is the movie’s original Spanish title), meaning Forgotten We’ll Be. (It is taken from the Borges poem, The Epitaph: “Already we are the oblivion we shall be.”) Cámara plays Gómez, the professor, husband and father to a lively and talented family of mostly girls, and one somewhat pampered son: Hector, played by Nicolás Reyes Cano as a moon-faced boy and then by Juan Pablo Urrego as an earnest, bespectacled literature student. Gómez is adored by his family, by his students and by the local community in Medellín, in whose streets he is an inspiring figure, striding around proselytising for what he calls the five basic human rights: air, water, food, shelter and affection. But he is continuously harassed by the authorities for these progressive views, and forced to take an evasive sabbatical abroad at one stage and finally early retirement. The movie has “present-tense” scenes in the 1980s, shot in black and white, but Hector’s ecstatically remembered 1970s childhood is shot in sunlit colour. This is a wonderfully sympathetic, deeply felt and tenderly funny family drama with a novelistic attention to details and episodes – a little like Alfonso Cuáron’s Roma, about growing up in a similar era in Mexico City. Cámara thoroughly inhabits the figure of Gómez: unselfconsciously inspiring and lovable. • Memories of My Father is released on 26 March on Curzon Home Cinema.
Made in Italy review – autobiographical poignancy from Liam Neeson and son	The big, unique selling point of this somewhat sappy but quite watchable feature is that the two main roles – a charismatic, widowed artist named Robert and his handsome but still finding-his-feet-careerwise son Jack – are played by Liam Neeson and his real-life son, up-and-coming actor Micheál Richardson. In the film, Robert’s wife/Jack’s mother died tragically young in a car accident. This, of course, parallels the death of Neeson’s real-life wife/Richardson’s mother, Natasha, from injuries incurred during a skiing accident when her sons were still in their teens. Knowing all this adds a certain frisson to the climactic scene where father and son have it out about the different ways they handled the late woman’s death. But the lack of finesse, in scriptwriting terms, with which the emotional punch is landed robs the scene of the impact it deserves. Elsewhere, the yarn is more entertaining as an uber-bougie slice of property porn about the two men bonding as they fix up, with ludicrously obvious symbolism, the palatial Tuscan house they inherited from Jack’s late mother. Jack, it transpires, wants to sell the place so he can buy an art gallery he ran for his own ex-wife’s family. Obviously, he’s going to be tempted away from that path by the golden sunlight of the region and the charms of pretty local woman Natalia (Valeria Bilello); the kind of restaurant owner who, unlike any real-life restaurateur, doesn’t seem to need to spend much time at her establishment, leaving her lots of free hours to float about in tea dresses and hang out with the visiting menfolk from London painting walls. Realism is clearly not a strong suit for writer-director James D’Arcy, but he gets pretty good comic performances from his likeable cast, which includes Lindsay Duncan as an acerbic estate agent. •Made in Italy is released on 26 March on Amazon Prime Video.
Retaliation review – Orlando Bloom gives it his all in lacerating sexual-abuse drama	Orlando Bloom has often looked perfectly happy with a Hollywood career, starring in movies as opposed to necessarily acting in them. But he outdoes himself in this British indie drama playing a man traumatised by childhood sexual abuse at the hands of a Catholic priest. There’s a kind of blunt brute force to his performance – and he looks almost unrecognisable, as if he’s using certain muscles in his face for the first time. The film is a horror story: a disturbing, hard-to-watch ordeal with a lacerating script by Geoff Thompson, a sexual-abuse survivor who has written courageously about his own experience. Bloom is Malcolm, known to everyone as Malky, a nickname that doesn’t remotely suit him. He swaggers about full of rage, flying into a temper if anyone so much as looks at him funny. Malcolm works in the macho world of demolition, stripping old churches of fixtures and fittings before the bulldozers move in. Just in case you miss the point, his mum says over tea: “There’s a lot of churches. You won’t be able to knock them all down.” There’s a good deal of this sort of heavy symbolism, giving the whole thing an overcooked, oppressive feel. Malcolm’s shame and fear of intimacy emerge in some unflinchingly grim scenes. Sex with his on-off barmaid girlfriend (Janet Montgomery) is cold and horrible. At home, in secret, Malcolm abuses himself, staring into the mirror while he rapes himself with a wooden truncheon – it’s a shocking moment, and it will be too much for some. One day, having a pint in his local, Malcolm spots the paedophile priest (James Smillie) who raped him – he’s been moved back to the parish. The confrontation and narrative resolution that follow feel a bit hastily sketched-out. But there are lines here that land like a punch: “I was 12. When I woke up the next day I was 100.” • Retaliation is released on 26 March on digital platforms.
New photo shows Kristen Stewart as Princess Diana ahead of biopic Spencer	A new image of Kristen Stewart as Princess Diana has been released, as shooting on forthcoming biopic Spencer moves to the UK. Stewart, 30, will play the late princess in the film, directed by Chilean film-maker Pablo Larraín, whose biopic of Jackie Kennedy starring Natalie Portman won multiple Oscar nominations in 2017. In the photograph, Stewart smiles directly at the camera, wearing a layered blond bob as well as tartan blazer and diamond engagement ring that appear to be copies of those sported by the real woman. The film’s autumn release follows rave reviews for the most recent season of Netflix’s The Crown, in which Emma Corrin played the princess, winning a Golden Globe for her performance, as did Josh O’Connor as Prince Charles. The actor playing Prince Charles in the new film will be Jack Farthing, best known as baddie George Warleggan in BBC’s Poldark. Farthing, 35, also played John Lennon in ITV’s Cilla Black series and featured in The Riot Club, the big-screen version of the play Posh. The film is scripted by Peaky Blinders’ Steven Knight, and scored by Radiohead’s Jonny Greenwood. Supporting cast include Timothy Spall, Sally Hawkins and Sean Harris. The actors playing the young princes William and Harry have not been announced; last year, British passport holders were ruled out of contention for the roles over post-Brexit visa concerns. Spencer is set over the course of a decisive weekend in December 1991, during which Princess Diana spends the Christmas holidays with the royal family at Sandringham, and decides to leave her marriage to Prince Charles. “The Prince and Princess of Wales’ marriage has long since grown cold,” reads a press release. “Though rumours of affairs and a divorce abound, peace is ordained for the Christmas festivities at Sandringham Estate. There’s eating and drinking, shooting and hunting. Diana knows the game. This year, things will be a whole lot different.” It’s the first big feature film to be made about the princess since 2013’s much-ridiculed Diana, which starred Naomi Watts and was labelled “car crash cinema” by the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw. Stewart described Spencer in a statement as “a dive inside an emotional imagining of who Diana was at a pivotal turning point in her life”. Filming was taking place in Germany, but has moved to the UK. The film is scheduled for release this autumn.
Bafta diversity scheme participant says casting director made racist comments	A scheme set up by Bafta with the aim of improving diversity in the film and TV industry has come under fire from one of its former participants, who said she had experienced racist comments and a lack of promised disability support. India Eva Rae, who joined Bafta’s Elevate programme in 2019, told the BBC that a casting director told her she was an “exotic talent”, and that they “can’t understand the English coming out your mouth”. Rae also said that she had been told not to report the incident by a “mentor” on the scheme: “This mentor told me and other members of the group that we will never work again if we speak up.” Bafta CEO Amanda Berry said in response that the organisation “was aware that [Rae] had had a negative experience with a casting director, as they mentioned it in passing … but we are not aware that this happened as part of the Elevate programme.” The BBC also report that Bafta said it had not received any complaints about either incident, but that if it had, they would have been taken extremely seriously. Rae also said she had difficulties accessing disability support. Rae was selected in 2019 for Bafta’s Elevate programme after featuring in the Channel 4 anthology series On the Edge. Elevate was set up in 2017 and is described by Bafta as “a new bespoke annual programme that aims to elevate individuals from under-represented groups to the next stage of their career”. It was one of a set of initiatives introduced by Bafta to increase diversity in the film and TV industry, alongside changes to eligibility for its awards and membership process. Bafta recently joined the the BFI to relaunch a programme to combat bullying, harassment and racism in the screen industries. Berry added: “It is a matter of great sadness and regret for me that anyone would feel this way, and our door remains completely open to find a solution, and to ensure that every participant benefits from the scheme.” “I know that other participants have found this to be a truly fantastic opportunity.” In a statement to Deadline, Bafta said: “Bafta condemns bullying, harassment, racism and discrimination of any kind and we take allegations of this nature incredibly seriously and will investigate urgently. We go to great lengths to ensure our programmes are as inclusive and accessible as possible for everyone who takes part, whatever their specific support needs are, and have responded to and want to resolve the participant’s requests in this area.”
Tom & Jerry The Movie review – sanitised relaunch of the cat and mouse combatants	Whoever wins, parents lose. While there’s little to truly loathe in Fantastic Four and Ride Along director Tim Story’s frantic new take on Tom &amp; Jerry, there’s also an equal lack of anything to truly love; this is a serviceable, if entirely forgettable attempt to relaunch an old property for a new audience. Very young kids might find some enjoyment in the brightly hued, fast-paced mania of it all, but those with any real affection for the pair of violently opposed animals will leave unimpressed. With a script that feels lazily retrofitted to revolve around the two animals rather than designed directly for them, this is basically a kids’ movie about antics in a New York hotel that pauses every so often to feature a sanitised fight between the pair. The decision to combine live action with animation often jars (every human is real, every animal is animated) and, within the realism of Manhattan, we’re then left with questions about the rules that have been haphazardly set up. (Why, for example, can some animals talk but not others? Violence seems to cause no harm to animals, so would humans also be immune?). These are questions that we perhaps wouldn’t be forced to ask if the film itself were more engaging. Chloë Grace Moretz, playing a grifter turned hotel employee turned cat and mouse peacemaker, is at least well-suited to the material. Her precocious brand of acting has seemed to pause rather than progress as she segues from child to adulthood, but her over-pronounced comedy works well here – there’s a brisk efficiency to her scenes with suspicious co-workers played by Rob Delaney and Michael Peña (both far more comfortable than SNL’s Colin Jost, fully lost). The animals themselves are a little underpowered, their signature scraps never quite inventive or audacious enough. The film’s sunny energy and its refreshing lack of toilet humour (something that’s stunk up many a kids’ movie in recent years) makes it an inoffensive effort, but it’ll race from your memory faster than Jerry from Tom. • Tom &amp; Jerry The Movie is released on 25 March on digital platforms.
Violation review – a brutal and brilliant debut	The revenge movie is the blunt weapon in the film-maker’s toolkit. Audience bloodlust is sated by justifiable violence; we get a guilt-free kick out of the kicking because justice is seen to be served. As a genre, it’s effective, but basic. Infinitely more unsettling and challenging are the films that dissect the whole idea of revenge, confronting the audience with its own complicity – films such as Gaspar Noé’s Irréversible and now Madeleine Sims-Fewer and Dusty Mancinelli’s brutal and brilliant directorial debut, Violation. Violation is as much a film about trauma as it is about revenge. In a PTSD-shattered timeline, the remarkable Sims-Fewer plays Miriam, a woman visiting her sister (Anna Maguire) and brother-in-law (Jesse LaVercombe). The sisters cling to a comfort blanket of shared history, but it’s soon stained by an act of betrayal. Miriam finds herself compelled to seek revenge. But no amount of meticulous planning can prepare her – and us – for the visceral realities of the act. The muted natural light of dawn and dusk elsewhere in the film is a contrast to the scorching campfire orange that drenches the violence; the naturalism of the performances is heightened by merciless details in the sound design. It’s gruelling, but fiercely intelligent film-making. Available exclusively on Shudder
Memories of My Father review – loving portrait of a parent 	A child’s-eye view of a hero father – Javier Cámara stars as dedicated parent, doctor, human-rights leader and all-round good egg Héctor Abad Gómez – is saturated with a honeyed colour palette and an unapologetically sentimental score. But as the child grows into an adult, the film adopts starker black-and-white photography and a harder-edged approach to Colombia’s tumultuous political backdro. Adapted, somewhat inelegantly, from an autobiographical novel by Héctor Abad Faciolince, Memories of My Father is a touch overlong and soapy and awkwardly structured. But it’s still an engrossingly watchable drama. • On Curzon Home Cinema
Tom and Jerry review – wearisome live action adaptation	The long-running feud between cat and smart-aleck mouse gets a new platform in this feature-length adaptation of the Hanna Barbera cartoon. The backdrop is a swanky Manhattan hotel, which is set to host the wedding of the year. The approach, a marriage of cluttered live action with madcap 2D animation, owes an obvious debt to Who Framed Roger Rabbit, but has more in common with the wearisome and unfunny Garfield: The Movie. Chloë Grace Moretz stars as Kayla, an opportunist who cons her way into a job using a stolen résumé. It’s astute casting – Moretz’s habitually overblown acting style seems slightly less jarring when juxtaposed with rampaging cartoon elephants. The film is most entertaining when it wreaks havoc – a car chase involving a commandeered military drone is a slickly executed riot. But lazy writing squashes any real fun as emphatically as an Acme anvil dropped from a roof. • Available on all platforms
Undine review – a shaggy catfish of a story about a woman with a water obsession	Christian Petzold’s Undine is an intriguing, bemusing oddity of a film: a suspense drama-thriller with a fey supernatural twist. It’s a sphinx that, if not exactly without a secret, has less of a secret than it thinks it has. And it is possible to come away from the film less than convinced, but very impressed by the sheer force of Petzold’s film-making talent (recently so stunning in his drama Transit) but which has been here deployed for something which is a bit flimsy and silly. Paula Beer plays Undine who, as her name suggests, may have intense sympathies with water. She lives in Berlin, and is a stylish and elegant historian who lectures on the city’s architectural history at the Berlin City Models exhibition. But she is also conducting an unhappy adulterous affair with Johannes (Jacob Matschenz), which is reaching its unhappy end at the film’s opening - revealing a flash of something angry and even violent in Undine. But in the midst of this traumatic episode, Undine is to have a fateful encounter with a strange man who has heard her lecture, and appears to be in love with her. This is Christoph, an underwater diver played by Franz Rogowski - a sensual screen presence with a little of Joaquin Phoenix. Soon Undine and Christoph are having a passionate affair, and he introduces her to his mysterious professional world, little guessing that she may be far more at home in it than he ever could be. Their relationship is passionately sensual, though Undine is perplexed at the sheer rapture with which Christoph listens to her lectures about Berlin’s planning history. Is there a metaphorical dimension to this? Maybe. Certainly their emotional connection has restored something like happiness to her, and effaced the mad furious unhappiness of her former liaison. But then she is to chance across Johannes once again and a terrible destiny begins to stir in those watery depths with which Undine feels such empathy. In truth, Undine is a bit of a shaggy dog story, or maybe a slimy giant catfish story; though it is just so skilfully made, beautifully acted and directed. Rogowski brings something unstable and dangerous to the part and so, in a more contained way, does Beer. What might this cast and this director do if they were working on a more compelling and substantial story? As it stands, Undine is a diverting and handsomely crafted piece of fantasy. • Released on 2 April on Curzon Home Cinema
Wilderness review – young lovers' lost weekend	Here’s an interesting project from the film school at Falmouth University: a low-budget drama put together by four film-makers – including director Justin John Doherty and screenwriter Neil Fox, a Falmouth lecturer – with professional actors but otherwise crewed entirely by student first-timers skipping the intern phase. The result is rather lovely, a talky cine-literate portrait of a new relationship set in the 1960s. (I’m not sure you could make such an uncynical film about a couple falling in love in the present day.) It reminded me a little of Blue Valentine, without the messy raw bits, or the divorce – basically before Ryan Gosling gets a beer gut. There’s a nice emotional fluency to James Barnes’ performance as John, a thoughtful jazz musician who drives with his new girlfriend Alice (Katharine Davenport) to a cottage by the sea for the weekend. There is terrific chemistry between the pair; they can’t keep their hands off each other. But John has a gnawing fear that it won’t last, that love will fade. Alice is sunnier-natured, a bit careless of other people’s feelings. There are two crisis episodes over the weekend. John takes Alice for dinner at the house of old friends, another couple, who have left London. The husband Charlie (Sebastian Badarau) is a drummer who has given up touring to teach. Nothing much happens but it emerges that John hasn’t been honest about how well he knows the wife Francis (Bean Downes). Feeling betrayed, Alice ruthlessly flirts with both Charlie and Francis to punish him. Hungover the next day they get stranded on the beach as the tide comes in. Everything plays out in absorbing emotional detail. My only reservation with the film is how tasteful it is – from Alice’s chic boyish haircut to the Scandi-chrome coffee pot and the sweat-free sex. And it’s out of politeness perhaps that the film avoids the issue of race. John is black, and Alice is white, and there’s a nasty incident on the beach when a dog tramples their picnic. Its owner, a tweed-capped toff, is blatantly racist; it’s as clear as daylight. The couple talk about everything, but not this? • Wilderness is released on 5 April on digital platforms.
Selfie review – droll Gallic eye on slaves to the algorithm	As ever-evolving technologies produce instant gratifications and fresh horrors, Selfie sees modern life as a tragicomic minefield fraught with absurdities. This French anthology film delivers biting social critique with a side helping of je ne sais quoi wit. Across five loosely connected stories from five seasoned film-makers (including Rust and Bone scriptwriter Thomas Bidegain), human idiosyncrasies are constricted by algorithms and reduced to likes. Though pushed to ridiculous comedic heights, Selfie’s cautionary tales are not so far-fetched. A married couple whose famous vlogs revolve around their son’s cancer scramble for content now that he is cured. In a reversal of stereotypes, a female teacher anonymously ambushes a viral male comedian with vicious tweets, only to pique his romantic interest. A seemingly content man slowly unravels as he blindly obeys his algorithmic ads. An awkward millennial manipulates his ratings on a dating app through nefarious methods. And finally, the farcical pièce de résistance: on an island with limited phone signals, a wedding goes haywire as a massive data hack reveals everyone’s dirtiest online secrets. All (digital) hell breaks loose. Underneath these satirical Black Mirror-esque scenarios are all-too-relatable emotional issues. The characters wrestle with online abuse, shopping addiction, stalking impulses and countless other urban malaises. Notifications overstuff their lives – and the film’s frame – yet leave them dissatisfied. No wonder they whisper online metrics as pillow talk. It’s a weakness that, for a film so heavily centred on social media, Selfie lacks tech savviness when it comes to certain platforms. For instance, in the “Vlog” section, it makes little sense that the couple’s videos fluctuate between two million views one moment and a measly 900 hits the next simply because of the cancer-free announcement. Nevertheless, Selfie’s cackleworthy dialogues and energetic performances more than make up for the occasional missteps. • Selfie is released on 26 March on Your Screen.
Last Call review – bad news, good booze	This soft-headed comedy-drama has the profundity and about the same wit level of one of those joke signs you see above bars, and often feels like it was scripted on a hangover after a two-day bender. Jeremy Piven plays Mick, prodigal real estate-developer son who returns to his old stomping ground of Darby Heights (based on Philadelphia’s Upper Darby) for his mother’s funeral. His feckless buddies, including jail-hopping brother Dougal (Zach McGowan), are still living their old boozy lives. What Mick thinks will revitalise the neighbourhood – and fend off the real-estate sharks circling, among other things, his dad’s pub – is a new casino. The obvious contradiction here – that Mick’s idea is ridiculous, and he is in fact part of what is threatening Darby Heights – is never meaningfully broached, as Last Call lets the hot topic of gentrification go begging. Director Paolo Pilladi and writer Greg Lingo (who is from Upper Darby) are so fired up making the film an ode to bar-room high jinks and blue-collar camaraderie that characterisation suffers. The boys call Mick out for forgetting his roots – but dragging him off for the umpteenth binge, they are mystifyingly unquestioning of his canvassing for the casino. Last Call visibly crunches gears when it does remember to tackle Mick’s divided loyalties, like when he (implausibly) asks one of his real-estate associates outside when he gets into a spat with a bar pal. The badinage is sporadically funny – even if it drifts too much towards the puerile, as with a running gag about Mick’s priapism problem. But any hope Last Call might skate by on working-class charm is hobbled by Pilladi’s timid direction: flat-footed and full of unimaginative choices. When Mick and his dad are having a heart-to-heart, Irish folk music lilts on the soundtrack; for the Greek family of Mick’s crush, Ali (Taryn Manning), it’s jaunty rebetiko. It all lets down an impressive cast that includes Bruce Dern, Raging Bull’s Cathy Moriarty and Scream’s Jamie Kennedy. One of the boys in Entourage, Piven breezes through likably enough – possibly they hoped that was a pass for the film’s flakiness. • Last Call is released on 29 March on digital plaforms.
Paintball Massacre review – splatterhouse horror with scattershot acting	This scruffy British-made comedy-horror, helmed by debut director Darren Berry, features a large ensemble cast with an extremely wide range of acting skills. Sadly, just as the story itself turns on how each individual’s flaws endanger the whole team, the same goes for the movie itself: thudding line readings and embarrassing bursts of overacting sully the better work on display. But maybe it’s a fool’s errand to expect much better from a film about a team of paintballers, all friends from a secondary school who graduated in 2004, being murdered one by one in comically grotesque ways in a tatty woodland area near a quarry. The makers have cited British comedy-horror features Hot Fuzz and Dog Soldiers as touchstones. Knowing that at least serves to help viewers appreciate how deftly the writer-directors of those earlier films, Edgar Wright and Neil Marshall, balance comic timing and tension-building, while coaxing good performances. But even they might have struggled with mayhem on a paintball course, a daft premise that isn’t exploited as well as it might have been – given how innately silly this mock military pastime is, one so beloved of middle-management types and macho-minded suburbanites. But at least Natasha Killip, as a filthy-mouthed, evil-tempered glamour model, and Aoife Smyth as a perpetually stoned fan of the Fast and the Furious franchise are around to perk up the scenes they’re in with well-timed insult comedy and stream-of-consciousness monologues about Vin Diesel and Paul Walker. Reliably funny comedian Katy Brand is also good for a few laughs as one of the paintball course’s marshals, especially when she is found lying irritably on the ground with half her intestines pulled out. The rest of the cast seems to consist mostly of interchangeable bearded white guys. • Paintball Massacre is released on 5 April on digital formats.
Zana review – witchy wisdom and Lynchian shadows in Kosovan drama	Lume (Adriana Matoshi) and her husband Ilir (Astrit Kabashi) managed to survive the late 90s war in Kosovo, but suffered the unthinkable loss of their young daughter, Zana, who was killed in crossfire. The years have passed on the farm where they live with Ilir’s formidable mother Remzije (Fatmire Sahiti), and the waters of everyday routine have flowed back into the scars. But Lume cannot let go of the past. Although seemingly the good, submissive little wifey that this close-knit, extremely old-fashioned society expects her to be, she’s racked with sorrow, and suffers from constant nightmares, featuring images that range from disturbing and bloody to downright David Lynchian, full of shadows and veiled figures backlit by moonlight. Remzije is pressuring Ilir to consider taking a second wife so that he can sire more children now that Lume can’t seem to get pregnant. In desperation, Lume agrees to see faith healers: the first, a witchy but wise woman in their own village; the second, a more sinister character who charges €500 per consultation and is prone to diagnosing demonic possession. Kosovan writer-director Antoneta Kastrati draws deep from the wells of both her homeland’s tragedy and her own in this disturbing, unnerving story. The flecks of horror in the way she handles some of the nightmare imagery may trigger some viewers to expect a different outcome from the deep drink of bleak we finally get served. Zana is a tough watch, but Matoshi’s fine-grained performance is a blessing to watch and there are incidental pleasures, particularly in the way the film languishes in the sultry, cruelly fecund landscape. On an anthropological level, there is something especially fascinating about this insider’s view of Kosovo society, where archaic beliefs about family mores rub up against people watching YouTube to learn new recipes for family meals. • Zana is on digital platforms from 2 April.
Oscars poised to loosen no-Zoom policy for this year's ceremony	Producers for this year’s Oscars ceremony are said to be considering relaxing their policy of mandatory in-person attendance for this year’s nominees. According to a story in the Hollywood Reporter, the Academy has invited all nominees to participate in a Tuesday morning Zoom “conversation with show producers” Steven Soderbergh, Stacey Sher and Jesse Collins. This will include “updates about the show” as well as details on options should they need to participate remotely. Earlier this month, producers had said there would “not be an option to Zoom in for the show” and that nominees should turn up instead at Los Angeles’ Union Station, where this year’s ceremony will primarily take place. While most of this year’s nominees are based in the US, concern had been raised over the finances, logistics and safety of those based elsewhere flying to Los Angeles for the ceremony on 25 April. England has currently banned non-essential international travel until mid-May, although work exemptions are in place as evidenced by performers such as Harry Styles attending the Grammy awards earlier this month. Representatives of the five international feature films – submitted by Denmark, Hong Kong, Romania, Tunisia and Bosnia – could also face hurdles getting to Los Angeles. Speaking to the Guardian, Alexander Nanau, the director of Romanian film Collective, which is nominated for both best documentary and best international feature film, said: “We certainly hope to be there – provided it’s safe and logistics allow – but we trust the Academy will find a solution to accommodate nominees who face difficult travel restrictions.” Visitors to California are currently expected to quarantine for 10 days, incurring considerable expense and inconvenience, while the re-entry requirements for travellers back to their own countries vary widely. In some countries, visa offices remain closed.
The Night review – eerie check-in at an LA hotel	The fundamental creepiness of hotels is the driving force behind this very potent supernatural mystery-thriller from Iranian-American film-maker Kourosh Ahari: the creepiness of their deserted corridors, their stately or shabby lobbies, and their anonymous rooms, whose blankness keeps the secret of their previous occupants. It’s a creepiness that predates and is independent of Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining, though that’s admittedly an influence here. In modern-day Los Angeles, a young Iranian couple with a baby – Babak (Shahab Hosseini) and Neda (Niousha Noor) – are at a dinner party with friends in an unfamiliar part of town. They are tired and quarrelsome on the way home; Babak is really too drunk to drive, and Neda has lost her licence after an earlier run-in with a traffic cop, so they grumpily decide to check in to the nearest hotel. This turns out to be the Hotel Normandie (perhaps calling it “Hotel California” would have been too on-the-nose). The sinister receptionist of this odd establishment (George Maguire) tells them he only has a suite available: irritable and impatient, Babak takes it. So it is extremely disturbing for them to discover that they are in fact the hotel’s only guests, which moreover leaves them unable to explain the sudden heartstopping thumps on the door and the children crying for their mummy outside their room. Are they being haunted by some awful presence in the hotel, or by the festering secrets and lies in their own relationship? All these are ingredients for the kind of scary movie that’s usually a terrible cliche, and to be fair, there’s nothing obviously new about The Night. But it is put together with great style, force and visual imagination, and Ahari deftly uses the couple’s baby to ratchet up the tension. Uniformed authority figures, initially disturbing or intimidating, suddenly profess themselves to be entranced by the baby and ask if they may hold her – and somehow the couple can’t find a polite way of saying no. It delivers a clammy shiver of disquiet. • The Night is released on 2 April on digital platforms.
Tom Hanks’s son criticized for using ‘racist’ font on merchandise collection	Chet Hanks, son of the Hollywood actor Tom Hanks, has been criticized for using a “racist” font on his new collection of merchandise which is also controversially called White Boy Summer. His black and white range of clothes, which include hoodies, T-shirts, shorts, tank tops, leggings, caps and bike shorts, has been called out online for its use of a Gothic-style font that is close to the one used by white nationalists. It’s also similar to the Fraktur fonts, which were used in Nazi Germany most prominently on the cover of Hitler’s Mein Kampf book. “Hmm unfortunately the merch looks aggressively racist,” wrote one commentator on Twitter, while another wrote: “Jesus. When I think of typefaces white people should avoid, anything remotely calligraphic/blackletter looking pops immediately to mind, especially if it’s going to include the word ‘White’.” While on Hanks’s official Instagram a user said: “Proud Boys are gonna buy these tf up.” The Proud Boys are a far-right US group and in September fashion line Fred Perry withdrew their polo shirts which had been adopted by them. Hanks, who raps under the moniker Chet Haze and has acted in the TV shows Shameless and Empire, came up with the term “White Boy Summer” on Friday – a play on the Megan Thee Stallion song from 2019 Hot Girl Summer. “I just got this feeling man that this summer … it’s about to be a white boy summer,” he said. “Take it how you want, I’m not talking about Trump, Nascar-type white. I’m talking about me, (rappers) Jon B. Jack Harlow-type white boys, you know what I mean? Let me know if you guys can vibe with that, and get ready. ‘Cause I am.’” In a video posted a few days later, he clarified: “You know what’s not White Boy Summer … is having any ill will or prejudice towards anybody from a different background, race, walk of life than you.” On Tuesday Hanks announced he was also launching a range of Black Queen Summer merchandise, using the same font. “I want to see some white boys and some black queens wearing each other’s shirts,” he said in a video introducing them. Hanks, who previously went viral in January of 2020 for using a Jamaican accent at the Golden Globes when his father won the Cecil B DeMille Award, is launching an online acting class The Actors Advantage on Monday. The Guardian approached him for comment.
Original Gangster review – hitman thuggery misfires	Original? Nah. You could put this grim, unimaginative London crime drama under a microscope and still not find the teensiest speck of originality. It’s a nasty little film, shallow and badly acted, with a queasy macho streak – like a Guy Ritchie, only without the subtlety or attention to female characters. Original Gangster follows the rise of a hitman and begins with his backstory. As a 10-or-so-year-old, Castor (Badger Skelton) is spared death by Milo (Ian Reddington), a thug who murders his parents. For the next decade, orphaned Castor lives rough in London parks, eating cold beans out of the tin and honing his mugging skills; this is a film where men commit violence in swaggering slo-mo, music blaring. The illiterate voiceover feels like a parody: “The street was a money-hungry whore who demanded paying before providing me with her sweet pussy.” Nice. Skip ahead a decade, and Castor (played by Alex Mills with the charisma of a toaster), runs into Milo again. Milo is now a successful drug dealer who introduces Castor to American crime kingpin Jean-Baptiste (a career low from Steve Guttenberg). Milo also invites Castor round for dinner at his gaff, where we see him humiliate and physically assault his much younger wife (Isabele De Rosa). The film has a serious woman problem. Its female characters are either dead and saintly, or nags who get hit by men. In one scene, Castor is drinking alone in a graveyard when a young woman angrily tells him to move on. (Which completely misjudges the response of most women to being alone in a space with a lairy drunk man twice her size). When Castor calls her “darling” she rants at him: “Do you know nothing about the #MeToo movement, you misogynist pig?” So he thumps her. Thirty minutes later, the script wants you to root for him as love interest to Milo’s wife, herself a victim of violence. Do me a favour. • Original Gangster is released on 5 April on digital platforms and DVD.
Catch Us If You Can review – on the run with the Dave Clark Five	A year after Richard Lester’s A Hard Day’s Night, and a year before the Monkees were grown in TV’s pop culture lab, director John Boorman made his feature debut with this very English madcap pop lark from 1965, scripted by Peter Nichols and starring the Dave Clark Five as themselves. Or almost. They’re not supposed to be musicians, but rather stunt-men who live together in a wacky shared flat (evidently a converted church organ loft) that is dominated by gigantic posters of the sort generally collected by wealthy pop-art enthusiasts. Dave Clark plays handsome Steve, first among equals in the gang, and they’re filming a TV commercial for the meat-marketing board starring It -girl and supermodel Dinah (Barbara Ferris). She’s so important she has a bodyguard on the set, who frowningly reads The Naked Lunch. Dinah has a crush on Steve, and the couple impulsively decide to abandon the shoot, pinching the production’s E-type Jag and going on the run together for zany 60s-style misadventures – an escapade cynically exploited for publicity by Leon (played by silvery-voiced David de Keyser) who is the UK’s meat supremo and also apparently Dinah’s creepy sugar-daddy. This film is amiably daft, pretty clunky and dated, but a very potent time-capsule for the 1960s: like the early movies of Godard, it is obsessed with the language of publicity: advertising, magazines, the mass media. Yootha Joyce has a ripe cameo as an older woman who takes an interest in our Steve – though without pressing her attentions in ways that would have taken this film out of the teen/family entertainment bracket – and there is an odd scene in which Dinah and Steve warily encounter some grumpy hippies in a ruined building; here Britcom fans will enjoy the appearance of Sheila Fearn (Terry’s sister in The Likely Lads). An archival frisson. • Catch Us If You Can is released on 5 April on digital formats.
Antebellum review – the horrors of slavery repackaged as entertainment	There’s an increasingly wariness of slavery dramas. Must suffering always be the lens on Black lives? On the other hand though, the success of Get Out has Hollywood excited about the genre flick’s potential to interrogate America’s oldest, truest horror. Caught in the middle is Antebellum, starring Janelle Monáe: a film that attempts so much and fails at almost all of it. Debut writer-directors Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz offer an early display of proficiency with a tracking shot across an old south plantation: the “big house”, the cotton fields, the Spanish moss and the slave quarters, all handsomely bathed in the magic-hour glow and, later, by flickering candlelight. Acts of violent suppression happen in balletic slo-mo, allowing time to observe that some period details seem strangely off. These hints culminate in a mobile ringtone that seems to shift Monáe’s character – apparently a brutalised slave called Eden – to a new reality. She fell asleep next to her rapist and enslaver, but she wakes up surrounded by her loving family in their comfortable home. “Eden” is now “Veronica”, a prominent sociologist in 21st-century US, whose high-flying career takes her to a speaking engagement in New Orleans, and dinner out with friends (Gabourey Sidibe among them). This is a better life, certainly, but it is progress depicted in the shallowest terms. Veronica’s supposedly nourishing friendships are nothing but stereotypical sass and self-care prattle; her supposedly fiery politics consist of strung-together platitudes. The Black woman at Antebellum’s centre is as one-dimensional as the evil white racists on its peripheries. When one of these commences a whipping by saying, “It brings me no joy to do this”, the claim rings doubly false. Antebellum offers neither a coherent social commentary nor – thanks to its pat, ahistorical ending – a revenge thriller’s catharsis. What else, besides entertainment, could its purpose be? • Antebellum is released on 2 April on Sky Cinema.
Godzilla vs. Kong review – a spectacular battle of beasts	“There can’t be two alphas,” insists Rebecca Hall’s Dr Ilene Andrews. Well, quite. Adam Wingard’s cleanly choreographed spin on the Japanese kaiju movie is vastly superior to 2019’s muddy Godzilla: King of the Monsters, pitting the radioactive lizard against ancient enemy King Kong and launching the latter into the Earth’s apparently hollow core. The spectacle is more involving than the plot, especially the dazzling image of Kong floating skyward, serene and surrounded by purple glowing rocks. Godzilla vs. Kong is on multiple platforms
Rose: A Love Story review – woodland-shack thriller goes to ground	There’s a promising setup to this claustrophobic survivalist horror-thriller, written by its co-star Matt Stokoe, who performs opposite his real-life partner Sophie Rundle. But despite some strong moments and a theme which speaks to these times of coronoviral anxiety, the film doesn’t quite work dramatically or gel emotionally, with some odd, strained mood-shifts and uncertain dialogue scenes between the three lead characters towards the end. Rundle and Stokoe play Rose and Sam, a couple who live hermit-like in a remote woodland shack, almost as if in some postapocalyptic dystopia, though it is supposed to be the present day. Rose must be intensively looked after because of a medical condition requiring her to stay indoors, and certain dietary requirements that mean Sam has to get leeches by mail order. She is a writer, working on a novel on an old-fashioned typewriter, and Sam gets food by setting traps for rabbits in the surrounding forest and growing vegetables (though they evidently have enough cash for their needs, presumably including electricity bills). But their tense existence is threatened by Sam’s furious dispute with the person who is supposed to be their point of contact with the outside world, and then by the arrival of Amber (Olive Gray), a troubled young woman on the run from problems of her own. You cannot find fault with any of the performances as such. But in narrative terms, Amber’s appearance out of the blue – an event unconnected to the apparent “Straw Dogs” situation developing with the guys with whom Sam had been previously doing business – and Rose and Sam’s subsequent, bafflingly changeable behaviour towards her, are unconvincing. This feels like a project that could have done with more script development, good though the actors are. Rose: A Love Story is released on 5 April on digital platforms.
Infinitum: Subject Unknown review – solo time loop echoes lockdown	You’ve got to admire wife and husband film-makers Tori and Matthew Butler-Hart. Stuck in their London flat at the start of the pandemic, the pair wrote a sci-fi script together: a Groundhog-Day-meets-The-Matrix tale of a woman trapped in a time loop. They shot it à deux on an iPhone; she stars, he directs. And there are a couple of cameos, from Ian McKellen and Game of Thrones actor Conleth Hill (who quite literally phoned in their performances from home). It’s a genuinely impressive achievement, but for a film about the infinite possibilities of parallel universes, it’s exasperatingly samey. Tori Butler-Hart is Jane, a woman who wakes up every morning tied to a chair in the attic of a London semi with no memory of how she got there. Outside, the streets are eerily quiet. Scared but resourceful, Jane finds a door hidden behind a pile of junk. A camera on the wall is watching – and from time to time the soundtrack picks up the voices of her observers, distorted and crackling. Jane’s lockdown ordeal is replayed over and over again with slightly different variations – in way that begins to feel more ad nauseam than infinitum. Every day she wakes up in the chair, and every day gets a little closer to freedom: down the stairs, out of the back door, into a car. Then something happens to terrify her and bang, it’s back in the chair. Appearances from McKellen (sporting a dapper lockdown beard) and Hill don’t add much. The pair play physicists from the Wytness Quantum Research Centre – the place Jane is trying to reach. They speak to camera, talking heads on a documentary, but, frustratingly, explain very little. What ideas are here never really come to life. Though perhaps in the future, the film will come to look like a lockdown time-capsule: a reminder of the fear and isolation of spring 2020, and the unnerving feeling of standing in empty streets in towns and cities as if the world has stopped. • Infinitum: Subject Unknown is out now on digital formats.
A Dragon’s Adventure review – a mess of mind-melting, happy-clappy animation 	Rendered in supersaturated shades of mind-melting magenta, burnt-retina orange and eye-ache azure, this computer animated kids’ story (adapted from a German TV series called Der kleine Drache Kokosnuss) revolves around a somewhat socially divided community of dragons. In the strange taxonomy of this universe, there are flying Fire Dragons who can breathe fire, aquatic region-dwelling Water Dragons who speak a different language but know some pidgin English and, unaccountably, spiny-backed Gourmet Dragons who like to cook. There are also Fur Dragons and various other sorts, but for the purpose of this film the main characters are drawn from the ranks of the Fire and the Gourmet Dragons. They mostly peacefully co-exist in one seaside, although there are occasionally snarky comments about each other’s habits, suggesting that the respective groupings could be read as cultural or racial differences. Nevertheless, an effort to foster better inter-dragon harmony results in the organisation of a summer camp, so Fire Dragon hero Coconut and his best friend Oscar, a Gourmet Dragon, sail forth with chaperones for an island where Coconut’s grandfather remembers once meeting the exotic Water Dragons. They smuggle their friend Mathilda, a porcupine, in a box which just completely confuses things zoologically. In any event, there is a shipwreck, the Water Dragons seem none too friendly when first met, there are dragon-eating plants about and, worst of all, Oscar and Coconut have a disagreement. No one seems particularly worried about the fact that they’re all stranded on a desert island with no means of communicating with dragonkind across the water, but the ability to sing catchy little tunes about friendship sorts out everything. Altogether, this is a bit dull and baffling for anyone over the age of seven; but it’s largely inoffensive, maybe even laudable, with its relentlessly pro-tolerance happy-clappy message of love. I am still wondering why so many of the Fire Dragon characters are named after fruits while the Gourmet Dragons just have regular German names. And why is it called A Dragon’s Adventure (note the singular), instead of Dragons’ Adventure, since they all go on holiday, not just one dragon? • A Dragon’s Adventure is released on 2 April on digital platforms.
The Mauritanian review – in limbo in Guantánamo with Tahar Rahim	When Nancy Hollander (Jodie Foster) arrives at Guantánamo Bay, she’s wearing sunglasses. Her chic white bob and blue button-down shirt are hardly provocative, but a guard advises her to wear a hijab anyway – the detainees have been known to spit at women. The moment recalls Foster’s trainee FBI agent Clarice Starling in The Silence of the Lambs, met with a different bodily fluid in the bowels of a psychiatric hospital. The Mauritanian, a post-9/11 legal drama based on Mohamedou Ould Slahi’s 2015 memoir Guantánamo Diary, is less concerned with the particular psychology of its incarcerated protagonist than with the political machinery that kept him behind bars without an official criminal charge for 14 years. The excellent Tahar Rahim (A Prophet) brings softness and seriousness to Slahi, but overripe flashbacks to his horrific torture are shot with a cartoonish edge. It’s a double bind: depict an interrogation scene too realistically and run the risk of torture porn, but veer too off-kilter and the effect is distancing. Here, the styling is at odds with the otherwise straightforward courtroom narrative. The prestige procedural elements work better; the real-life story is enraging, and it’s fun to see Benedict Cumberbatch’s morally conflicted military prosecutor lock horns with Foster’s icy human rights lawyer. • On Amazon Prime
Undine review – romance with just enough magic and mystery	Writer-director Christian Petzold (Transit) riffs on the German myth of the water nymph whose love of a man secures her an immortal human soul. Undine (Paula Beer) is a historian in a leather jacket, her red hair recalling another Little Mermaid. “If you leave me, I’ll have to kill you,” she warns boyfriend Johannes (Jacob Matschenz), as per the fairytale. He dumps her anyway. Soon enough she has a new beau, a gorgeous industrial diver named Christoph (Franz Rogowski). The force of their initial attraction causes a fish tank to explode, soaking them to the skin. Undine gives lectures on Berlin’s changing architecture; this allows for neat parallels between a city haunted by the spectre of history and – like a gender-flipped Vertigo – our heroine tethered to the ghost of her past love. There’s just enough magic and mystery to tease out a supernatural reading of the film, though Petzold encourages viewers to find pleasure in puzzling out his femme fatale for themselves. Undine is on Curzon Home Cinema
Red Carpet review – rap-themed escape story loses itself in grim detail	Apart from Google Street View employees’ driveways, the LA “underbelly” must be the most filmed place on the planet, from Kiss Me Deadly to Training Day. That capital of spiritual degradation is where this scratchy low-budget drama is bound, as Angeleno wannabe Mandy (Wittie Hughes) meets-cute with a white-boy rapper on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and gets wrecked with him at a pool party. Mandy’s hopes of stardom take a nosedive when she wakes up on a plastic-sheathed mattress in an anonymous low-rise, apparently delivered into human slavery. She has become the “property” of Shadow, a tooth-grilled pimp who appears to have taken James Franco’s “Look at all my shit” soliloquy in Spring Breakers as sound career advice. His sidekick is a mute never seen without a gold Anonymous mask. Director Scott Altman keeps Mandy locked in her room and on strict exploitation-movie rations – she is raped, and cosies up to winsome fellow hooker Lola (Roshema Purfoy) for consolatory spliffs and lesbian cuddles. She alchemises the pain into rap, which finally provides her with a way out. Red Carpet buys hook, line and verse into LA rap romanticism, and at least looks the part: it makes handsome use of the drone technology that has democratised the establishing shot; it delivers at street level too, with a smeary digital aesthetic that is now the mandatory mode for shooting this languorous city. But the story is threadbare – resorting to rape far too often to manufacture incident – to seriously engage beyond lurid cliches. Red Carpet is at its best when it is swept up by its own vibe: Mandy gets lost in breakbeats as she dreams up misery-rhymes to soundtrack a break for freedom that, when it comes, unfolds like a rap video playing in her head. Red Carpet is released on 26 March on digital platforms.
Citizen Lane review – dashed hopes of a visionary art dealer	This Irish drama documentary feels like a contribution to ongoing efforts to guilt-trip the National Gallery in London into returning to Ireland more than three dozen French impressionist masterpieces bequeathed by the Irish art dealer Hugh Lane. When he wrote his will in 1913, stung by the Dublin authorities’ refusal to grant him planning permission to build a modern art gallery in the city, Lane left the 39 paintings to London. Later, he changed his mind, adding a codicil to his will. His intentions were as clear as day, but the codicil was unwitnessed. So, when he died aged 40 – travelling on the Lusitania, which was sunk by a German U-boat in 1915 – London got the paintings. The film opens with a bit of context, setting the mood in Ireland at the turn of the 1900s. This was the era of Irish cultural revival, WB Yeats and JM Synge, of Irish trade unionism and nationalism. The dramatised bits work pretty well. Tom Vaughan-Lawlor is terrific as Lane, an Irish Protestant, the self-made son of a clergyman. When he stares transfixed at a Titian, there is a blazing chemistry between man and painting. No other relationship can compete. In fact, Lane’s eye was so good that if he so much as looked at a painting before an auction its value shot up. Lane was a snob, but he believed in art for the people. His free-entry gallery in Dublin would have had a bridge over the Liffey, so that ordinary Dubliners would pass the Manets on their way to work. (“You may as well give strawberries to donkeys,” sneered a friend). The National Gallery in London asserts its strict legal rights over the painting, but Citizen Lane puts a convincing case that the moral right belongs to Dublin. (Too late for inclusion in the film, London and Dublin earlier this year reached a truce, agreeing to rotate a number of the paintings.) • Citizen Lane is released on 12 April on digital platforms.
Those That, At a Distance, Resemble Another review – meditation on the art and act of copying	Artist and film-maker Jessica Sarah Rinland has authored a brief essay movie on the universal themes of the copy and the original. A copyist reproduces an original work of art, a museum conservator fabricates a damaged object with replacement materials. But the originals are arguably copies of ideas and genres within the artist’s mind, and the biological act of reproduction is an act of copying, from the DNA template. Rinland’s camera observes calmly, almost blankly, as the introduction of howler monkeys into the wild is discussed by zoologists – a habitat where they might breed – and this issue is juxtaposed with restoration work at the V&amp;A, the Natural History Museum and the British Museum in London. An elephant tusk is copied as a plaster cast; confiscated tusks are used to restore a 19th-century ivory box, antiquities are painstakingly brought back to a version of their fundamental selves. It is intricate, meticulous work and Rinland follows it nearly in real time; it is an almost experimental procedure, although a series of titles at the very end make it clear exactly what we have been watching. The film is pregnant with ideas: I found myself thinking of Jean Baudrillard’s writings about the “simulacrum”, about a world with Elvis impersonators but no Elvis. As the ivory box is slowly restored to an approximation of its old self, we have the leisure to consider that this is an activity not very different from making it the first time around: both are from the same prototype, and that the time-lapse between the two has, in some sense, been abolished. • Those That, at a Distance, Resemble Another is available on 6 April on Mubi.
Workhorse review – beautiful but plodding paean to beasts of burden	This painstakingly composed black and white documentary about jobbing horses and their employer-companions is perhaps easier to admire than love. On the plus side, the cinematography by Ryan A Randall – a mix of widescreen, immersive landscapes and startlingly stylised shots with inky backgrounds, slow-motion details, or unexpected angles – is consistently beautiful. It’s what truly draws the viewer into this up-close and personal account, directed by Cliff Caines, of three different businesses that use proper working horses, great big massive ones, to do jobs that are in two out of three cases more often done with machines. In the first study, a timberman in Canada uses his two steeds, cheeky Orlagh and stalwart Idaho, to fell and collect trunks, a logging method he insists is better for the forest. The relationship between the logger, who retires at the end of the segment, and his equine co-workers is so emotionally rich that the more workaday, people-centric subsequent sections pale in comparison somewhat. Really, this first bit works on its own as a short, but there’s still much of interest in the second part, about a farming family who use horse teams to plough their fields, and the third, about another family that put their horses through competitions to see which one can haul the most weight – which strictly speaking sounds less like work than sport. By the last half hour, Caines’s use of long, slow takes, and the film’s clippity-clop walking pace grows a little numbing. Also, while the film-makers’ respect for their subjects is manifest, and the people featured all seem like experienced, loving custodians who don’t beat their horses, the film rather takes the humans’ word for it that these animals love to work, having been bred for it over generations. Admittedly, the horses themselves have no means to dispute that assessment, but if they could talk, you rather wonder whether they’d be quite so enthusiastic about lugging farm equipment and huge trees all day long. • Workhorse is released on 9 April on True Story.
Songs My Brothers Taught Me review – Chloé Zhao's deeply intelligent debut	In honour of Nomadland, the film from director Chloé Zhao that is set to dominate as the connoisseur-choice of this year’s awards season, here is a belated launch of her lovely feature debut from 2015, which never actually had a full release in the UK. I can’t believe it’s taken me this long to see it: some derivative, Malickian touches, yes, but like her other films, it’s a deeply intelligent and sympathetic rendering of real-life situations, using nonprofessionals playing approximations of themselves. The setting is the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota (the site of Wounded Knee creek, where the 1890 massacre of Lakota people took place); John Reddy and Jashaun St John play Johnny and Jashaun, a teen Lakota boy and his kid sister, whose lives are turned upside down when their absentee dad, a bronco rider, dies drunkenly in a fire. Johnny and Jashaun meet all their various half-siblings at the funeral. As Johnny says to his brother Cody (Justin Reddy), now in prison: “It’s as if he’s suddenly back in our lives, now that he’s gone … ain’t that funny?” This clarifies Johnny’s determination to move out of the “rez” and go to Los Angeles, where his aspirational girlfriend Aurelia (Taysha Fuller) is soon going to be a student at UCLA, living in dorms – and the plan is that Johnny somehow finds a job and a place to live, and they will live as a couple that way. Does Johnny believe in his own future? The sheer emotional hurt of Jashaun at being abandoned by her adored elder brother pulses through this film, and she has innocent adventures of her own: her presence gives the movie such warmth. Zhao’s authorial signature was obvious even then, and in just six years she has scaled amazing creative heights. • Songs My Brothers Taught Me is available on 9 April on Mubi.
Bittersweet Symphony review – pretty but fake-feeling family Christmas yarn	The freewheeling improv style of Jamie Adams (who directed the daffy comedy Black Mountain Poets) hits a wall in his new film about a family Christmas in Wales. There are comedy scenes here that flatline and lightweight fake-feeling emotional moments. Model-actors Suki Waterhouse and Poppy Delevingne are the stars: they look pretty uncomfortable playing sisters visiting their folks for the holidays. Maybe it’s snarky to say, but with their gorgeous knitwear and expensive London accents, it’s hard to buy either of them dunking a Bourbon into a cuppa. Waterhouse is Iris, a flaky-quirky, beret-wearing film composer who has landed a massive gig writing the soundtrack for a big-time Hollywood movie. The trouble is she’s creatively stuck, and anxious about her mum who is dying of an unspecified terminal illness (fading gently propped up on pillows, no fuss). Iris’s sister, Abigail (Delevingne), is back too, and the suggestion is that this is their last family Christmas together. To cure Iris’s writer’s block, her agent flies in legendary American songwriter Eleanor Roberts (Dirty Dancing’s Jennifer Grey), who shows up clanking Jack Daniel’s bottles and jangling silver bangles. The two women connect instantly. Cue earnest lines (“You’ve got to be more than a pretty girl with a guitar”) and boring scenes of them writing songs. Eleanor is also clearly attracted to Iris. Bittersweet Symphony is a film with serious plausibility issues; none of the characters come across like real human beings. But it deserves points for a funnyish subplot that brings home how romcoms so often idealise stalkerish behaviour. Submarine actor Craig Roberts plays Iris’s idiot ex, who devises a series of stunts to prove how much he still loves her – like wrapping himself as a giant Christmas present. It definitely adds to the film. That said, the Onion did the same thing in a one-sentence headline: “Romantic-Comedy Behaviour Gets Real-Life Man Arrested.” • Bittersweet Symphony is released on 12 April on digital platforms.
A Common Crime review – chilling ghost story with a social conscience	Guilt and the return of the repressed are behind this elegant, disquieting and impressively acted political ghost story from Argentinian film-maker Francisco Márquez. Cecilia (Elisa Carricajo) is a sociology professor and single mother of a little boy, Juan (Ciro Coien Pardo); she is very successful, though on edge about her recent application for an academic promotion. Cecilia gets on well with her maid Nebe (Mecha Martinez) but is made very uncomfortable when Nebe brings round her teenage son Kevin (Eliot Otazo). Kevin seems dour, unsmiling, perhaps with learning difficulties. In the middle of a stormy night, Cecilia is awoken by a terrifying banging at the door, preceded by an eerie dreamlike voice murmuring “Cecilia” in her ear. Peering through the shutters, she can see it is Kevin and is too scared to open up. The next morning, she sees on the news that Kevin’s body has been found in the river, with protesters alleging he was chased down and killed by the police – one of the state’s “common crimes” directed at the poor. Cecilia can’t bring herself to confess to Nebe that she could have helped her son, or tell any of her colleagues. And so she begins to crack under the terrible strain of maintaining this secret along with the day-to-day tasks of her sophisticated and successful intellectual life, believing Kevin has come back to haunt her. As well as a comment on Argentina’s present, A Common Crime is about its past: Kevin has been “disappeared”, like dissidents under the junta. And when Cecilia is late for work one day it makes her head of department very nervous – he is old enough to remember that when certain academics were “late”, they never showed up at all. There are points of comparison here with other films – the Dardennes’ The Unknown Girl, for example, or Lucrecia Martel’s The Headless Woman – and the junta killings arguably play the same role here as France’s “nuit noire”, the notorious 1961 police slaughter of Algerian protesters, in Michael Haneke’s Hidden. But Márquez brings his own distinctive touch and Carricajo is excellent; she shows us how, with so much at stake and with a lifetime’s adult experience at putting on a good show and presenting as perfectly fine, a prosperous middle-class professional can swallow a guilty secret and carry on. But the tiny poison symptoms inevitably begin to surface. A smart piece of work. • A Common Crime is released on 9 April on digital platforms.
Sequin in a Blue Room review – electrifying foray into online hookup culture	Boldly declaring itself a “homosexual film”, Sequin in a Blue Room is neither coy nor moralistic about online gay hookup culture. The apps have a toxic side, yes, but the film also acutely understands the heady, tactile pleasure of casual sex. Despite the thriller aesthetics, Sequin in a Blue Room is at its heart a coming-of-age tale in a digital world filled with instant sexual gratifications and perilous risks. The film is, in one word, hot; rippling with an electrifying sexual energy. The anonymity is key. Even the 16-year-old protagonist, played by Conor Leach, has no name. He is known only as Sequin, a display name on a hookup app where he procures no-strings sex from much older men. With cut-glass cheekbones, Sequin is striking and arrogantly cocksure of the power attached to such assets. The silvery, sequin-encrusted crop-top reserved for his trysts only enhances the detached precocity. Nevertheless, Sequin’s walls come tumbling down when he finds himself at an anonymous sex party called the Blue Room. The scene pulsates with carnal desires and a hint of danger. Bathed in a dazzling blue light, indiscernible bodies writhe to hypnotic electronic music, while Sequin enjoys an intense encounter with another man. As lust ignites what feels like love, Sequin searches for his unidentified hookup, only to get entangled in a web of lies, manipulation and predation. That Sequin in a Blue Room was director Samuel van Grinsven’s graduate project is astonishing considering the film’s inspired visual panache, and the eroticism of the explicit depictions of casual sex. Leach’s performance in his first film acting credit is equally impressive; the way in which Sequin’s swagger gradually drains from his face to expose an inner vulnerability is incredibly moving. With such an impressive debut, Van Grinsven is surely one to watch. • Sequin in a Blue Room is released on 9 April on digital platforms.
I’m Not in Love review – anti-romcom that nails sex and dating	Shot in and around London’s Hampstead and Belsize Park areas, this quirky anti-romantic comedy revolves around thirtysomething nutritionist Rob (likably schlubby Al Weaver), an ordinary bloke who can’t quite bring himself to commit, and his longsuffering long-term girlfriend Marta (Cristina Catalina). Keenly aware of how little time is left on her biological clock and desperate to have a baby, she stands by virtually tapping her foot while she waits for him to propose, or at least agree to get her knocked up. Rob, meanwhile, surveys the wildly contradictory advice he gets from his eclectic assortment of male friends. Some, particularly the ones already paired up and reproducing, counsel Rob to settle for Marta and stop looking for the perfect woman because no one will be that girl. Rob secretly wants to be more of a player like his friend Chris (Morgan Watkins), a smoothie who looks like a better version of Rob – but who is suffering from erectile dysfunction problems and has a growing interest in seeing escorts because it’s “more honest”. It would be so easy for this film to end up leaving a bitter taste in the mouth, but writer-director Col Spector is trying to work up something that is essentially more honest than the usual romcom. The gags don’t always land, and some of the line deliveries plod painfully on, but there are moments that nail the strange comedy of sexual manners that must be navigated these days; is it appropriate, for example, to pull your date out of a threesome if they’re clearly enjoying themselves and want to stay? The depressed clarinet soundtrack gets a bit irritating after a while, but on the whole it’s not at all bad, and John Henshaw’s cameo as one of Rob’s disgruntled patients is a particular treat. • I’m Not in Love is released on 12 April on digital platforms.
Jules Verne’s Rocket to the Moon review - genial 60s British wacky-space-racers 	There’s an serious outbreak of top hats and mutton chops in this amiable adaptation of Jules Verne’s From the Earth to the Moon, originally released in 1967, when the real world was gearing up for the Apollo moonshot a couple of years later. Produced by the prolific Harry Towers, it adopted the rambling wacky-races format that had proved enduringly popular throughout the 1950s and 60s; most recently with the 1965 hit Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines, which it shamelessly capitalised on with its US title (Those Fantastic Flying Fools) as well as redeplying the ubiquitous Terry-Thomas, who played yet another moustache-twirling cad. Rocket to the Moon is watchable in a bored-Sunday-afternoon sort of way: it’s about whether an international consortium, led by Burl Ives (as Phineas T Barnum) and Dennis Price, can successfully build a giant cannon into the side of a mountain that can fire a human missile up to the moon, using a radical new form of gunpowder. Terry-Thomas is the chief meanie, with inventor brother-in-law Lionel Jeffries; Troy Donahue plays a dashing balloonist who lands in the middle of it all. Conceived on a relatively large scale for a British film of the period, it’s hampered somewhat by the fact there is no actual race to speak of, as well as the necessity of expanding scenes for some of the actors to placate international financing. Some of the material, it’s safe to say, has not dated well: particularly the jokes at the expense of Tom Thumb (Jimmy Clitheroe), and the dumb-ditz scenes given to Israeli actor Daliah Lavi. There’s a certain steampunk energy on show but it’s otherwise pretty good-natured, offering the mostly undemanding spectacle of people falling off penny-farthing bicycles or crashing into haystacks. You couldn’t call any of this actually funny, but it’s pleasant enough. • Jules Verne’s Rocket to the Moon is released on 12 April on digital platforms, Blu-ray and DVD.
The Power review – merciless East End hospital horror	In Don McCullin’s 1970s photographs of grinding poverty in the East End, Whitechapel looks like it might have in Dickens’s lifetime. And it’s grim deprivation that student nurse Val (Rose Williams) walks into on her first day on the wards of an east London hospital in this feminist horror; her first patient is a little girl with rickets and stunted growth. Written and directed by Corinna Faith, this film is a real screw-tightener, ingeniously set during the miners’ strike in January 1974. What could be scarier than the lights going out in a Victorian hospital in the dead of night? When Val arrives most of the patients are being transferred to another hospital for the night because of a scheduled power cut. Val is on the “dark shift” – staying to cover two wards kept going by a generator. She is too embarrassed to admit that she’s scared of the dark, triggered by childhood abuse in a care home. Pretty soon Val is clinging to the corridor walls, groping her way in the dark – and that’s even before things go bang in the night. There are cracking lines in the script; unexpectedly, some of them very funny. In the staff room, an Irish nurse is reading Stephen King’s Carrie (not actually published until three months later, in April). “It’s about a girl who’s had enough and burns it all down,” jokes the nurse. And what follows is like Carry on Carrie – or maybe more Carry on Exorcist. Val becomes possessed by a demonic power. Or is she experiencing a psychotic episode? Either way, the bodies are piling up as a result of masculinity (in the hospital and elsewhere) that’s so toxic it’s literally contaminating everything. After a bit of a damp start, the scares are merciless. Demonically possessed characters convulsing are ten a penny in horror movies, but Val’s limbs twist like she’s a doll being yanked by a spiteful toddler. It’s unbearable to see in places, especially since Val has already suffered so much. Now some kind of malevolent force is taking over her body, another violation. Empowerment for female victims comes late in the day too, making this a raw and painful watch. • The Power is released on 8 April on Shudder.
Regé-Jean Page ‘hurt’ to learn race was factor in rejection from Superman show	The actor Regé-Jean Page has addressed reports he was turned down for a leading role in the superhero TV series Krypton because of his skin colour. “Multiple sources” cited by the Hollywood Reporter earlier this week suggested the producers of Krypton – an origins series focused on Superman’s grandfather – were “passionate about doing some nontraditional casting” when recruiting for the show, which ran for two seasons starting in 2018. This reportedly led to Page landing an audition, until his possible appointment was vetoed by Geoff Johns, the co-founder of DC Films, who said Superman “could not have a black grandfather”. Tweeting on Wednesday evening, Page wrote: “Hearing about these conversations hurts no less now than it did back then. The clarifications almost hurt more tbh. Still just doing my thing. Still we do the work. We still fly.” In a statement to E! News, a representative for Johns said his client felt fans would expect Superman’s grandfather, , “to look like a young Henry Cavill”, referring to the actor who most recently played Superman on the big screen. They continued: “Geoff never said Superman can’t have a black ancestor or be black – there have been diverse versions of Superman throughout the comics for decades so he does and can be diverse. “However, the expectation for Krypton was that it would initially be perceived as a possible prequel to Man of Steel by the fans and the lead was expected to invoke a young Henry Cavill.” Page’s decision to leave the hit Netflix show Bridgerton after one series has surprised many and led to numerous rumours about possible next roles for the actor, who recently hosted Saturday Night Live. He is the current favourite to replace Daniel Craig as James Bond, following the release of No Time to Die in September. Some reports have also attached him to the Black Panther series. Although the title role is not thought to be up for grabs, following the death of star Chadwick Boseman last August, director Ryan Coogler and Marvel producers are said to be eager to expand the roster of characters whose stories would be explored in future films.
Night in Paradise review – operatic Korean display of gunfire and death	This gleefully blood-splattered Korean gangster film with an unlikely romantic subplot looks for most of its running time like the sort of cult-friendly genre discovery one could watch and then crow over before an inevitable Hollywood remake comes out. That said, the ending is so relentlessly bleak that a faithful remake would be unlikely – while an unfaithful one with a happier conclusion would be absurd given the ruthless logic of writer-director Park Hoon-jung’s plotting. The initiating setup is that after something really bad happens, moody pretty-boy gangster Tae-Gu (Eom Tae-goo) must hide out on a resort island in off-season before he is ultimately resettled in Vladivostok, Russia. En route he stays with a grumpy arms dealer, a former gangster himself, and that man’s troubled, taciturn niece Jae-Yeon (Jeon Yeo-been). But it soon transpires that there’s hidden depths in both Jae-Yeon and Tae-Gu, who after the de rigueur initial verbal sparring become unlikely friends – and maybe potential soul mates, especially when they end up bonding over their shared affection for mulhoe, a spicy raw fish soup which plays a significant role in the story. In fact, there are a lot of meals throughout, discussions of who is hungry and a key plot-furthering sit-down among gangsters in a restaurant that involves one of those huge rotating trivets typical of Korean restaurants so that people can share dishes more easily. This is not a film to watch on an empty stomach, both because the food looks great and those of a delicate disposition might, like one of the gangsters, feel a little nauseous after the gory bits. Leisurely pacing rather draws it all out a bit, but there’s real inventiveness to the way Park wrong-foots the viewer and handles the operatic displays of gunfire and death – and the leads are rather charming. • Night in Paradise is released on 9 April on Netflix.
The Frightened City review – crooks and coppers in a classic London noir	There’s a blue-chip cast for this tasty 1961 Brit noir, a brash and brassy mob drama in the bright lights of London’s Soho and the West End – the world of Dassin’s Night and the City. Alfred Marks plays Harry Foulcher, a creepy club owner whose supposedly legitimate business is a front for a protection racket, putting the arm on smalltime pubs and dives for a tenner a week. His crooked accountant Waldo Zhernikov, played with gorgeous insinuation by Herbert Lom, persuades Harry to sit down with all the other cauliflower-eared villains to form a profitable London-wide syndicate, to the disgust of the hard-nosed honest copper Detective Inspector Sayers, robustly played by John Gregson. These gangsters need a cool tough guy to collect the larger sums coming in, so they recruit a cat burglar called Paddy Damion, an ordinary decent criminal who needs the money … played by pre-007 Sean Connery. It’s richly enjoyable stuff and the early-60s London locations are a treat. As so often with this kind of movie, there’s fascination in the quaint club scenes: the racy, naughty, semi-unclothed floor shows in Soho establishments that are frequented by posh gentlemen who like to slum it, the sort of place where someone like Stephen Ward or John Profumo were to be found in Michael Caton-Jones’s Scandal (1989). Waldo has a young woman in whom he takes an almost Ward-like platonic interest: a Russian singer called Anya (Yvonne Romain) who warbles away at the grand piano that Waldo preposterously has in a room adjoining his office. Anya is to fall in love, naturally, with Connery. It’s all good stuff with some ripe cameos to be savoured by Talking Pictures TV fans. The Frightened City also happens to be the film debut of Stephen Lewis, then credited as Stephen Cato, playing a lanky young Brummie thug – later to be seen playing Blakey in TV’s On the Buses. • The Frightened City is available on 12 April on Blu-ray, DVD and digital platforms.
Palm Springs review – amusing time-loop romance is back … again	It’s possible to imagine a sci-fi nightmare about someone waking up in a world where every film they watch turns out to be a different remake of Groundhog Day – until that person fixes some awful sadness or wrongness or selfishness in their life. Only then can they sit down to a film and realise with a smile of inexpressible relief that it isn’t a bittersweet comedy about being trapped in a time-loop. Credits. It’s a credit to LA musician-turned-screenwriter Andy Siara that he has managed to make this time-loop film so ingenious, so good-natured and so funny, hurdling the inevitable deja-vu objections. We awaken in a luxury hotel resort at which Nyles, played by Andy Samberg, is a wedding guest, along with girlfriend Misty (Meredith Hagner) who is a maid-of-honour, and with whom Nyles has a sexual problem all too horribly indicative of his current cosmic situation. At the ceremony, Nyles is bleary, drunk and cheerfully disengaged, but at the reception party he finds a connection with the bride’s lonely, unhappy sister Sarah (Cristin Milioti, who played Teresa, the first wife of Jordan Belfort in The Wolf of Wall Street). They ditch the party to be alone together, but come into traumatic contact with another important person in Nyles’s life, a murderously angry old guy called Mike (JK Simmons), and Sarah is to realise the awful fix Nyles has got her into. Samberg is probably the only actor who could have sold this film’s premise to us so effortlessly and Peter Pannishly. As a performer, Samberg is a living cartoon of casual comic precision. He is 42 years old, but looks no older than he did when I first saw him in the 2007 comedy Hot Rod, plausibly playing a kid far younger than his then late twentysomething self. He maybe has a portrait of Paul Rudd in his attic (or it could be the other way around). Palm Springs was a smash at this year’s Sundance film festival, and people said it was because lockdown has made time-loops fashionable … again. But they are a perennially potent film subject. As for Palm Springs, it delivers some much-needed laughs. I’d like to watch it again. • Palm Springs is released on 9 April on Amazon Prime Video.
Phoebe Waller-Bridge joins new Indiana Jones movie	Phoebe Waller-Bridge is set to join Harrison Ford in the fifth Indiana Jones movie. The Emmy-winning star and creator of Fleabag will appear in as-yet-unconfirmed role in the latest instalment of the hit adventure franchise. Steven Spielberg, who had directed the previous chapters, will hand over the reins to James Mangold, whose recent credits include Logan and Ford v Ferrari. The director previously stated that he wanted to “pass along Indy’s whip to a new generation to bring their perspective to the story”. Spielberg will remain a producer along with Kathleen Kennedy, Frank Marshall and Simon Emanuel. “I’m thrilled to be starting a new adventure, collaborating with a dream team of all-time great film-makers,” Mangold said in a statement. “Steven, Harrison, Kathy, Frank, and John are all artistic heroes of mine. When you add Phoebe, a dazzling actor, brilliant creative voice and the chemistry she will undoubtedly bring to our set, I can’t help but feel as lucky as Indiana Jones himself.” The film follows 2008’s Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull which received mixed reviews but made over $790m worldwide. It’s set to be the 78-year-old Ford’s final film as the adventurer. “We’ve seen the character develop and grow over a period of time and it’s perfectly appropriate and OK for him to come back again with a great movie around him,” Ford said back in 2013. Waller-Bridge scored acclaim and awards for her two-season comedy drama Fleabag and has franchise experience having starred in Solo: A Star Wars Story and working on the script for the upcoming 007 thriller No Time to Die. The multi-hyphenate was also recently attached to a Mr and Mrs Smith reboot series alongside Donald Glover. The as-yet-untitled Indiana Jones sequel is set to arrive in cinemas in July 2022.

Thunder Force review – Melissa McCarthy gets superstrength in rote superhero comedy	Melissa McCarthy’s moderate new superhero comedy vehicle stars McCarthy opposite Octavia Spencer, and is written and directed by her husband, Ben Falcone, who has a cameo as a hapless henchman called Kenny – the subject of what may or may not be a South Park gag. In an alternate universe where the US is threatened by super-villains called Miscreants, Lydia (McCarthy) is a big-hearted kid from Chicago who in high school protects a super-smart girl called Emily from bullies; they become best friends who lose touch in adulthood. Lydia grows up to be a lonely, boozy worker in a packing plant but Emily – now played by Octavia Spencer – becomes a tech zillionaire developing genetic treatments to turn ordinary people into superheroes. When Lydia drunkenly blunders into Emily’s lab, insisting on taking her to a class reunion, she accidentally plugs herself into the equipment and gives herself super-strength. And so exasperated high-achiever Emily figures they might as well team up to form Thunder Force, battling a Miscreant called Laser (Pom Klementieff – Mantis, from the Marvel Cinematic Universe), together with a bad guy called the King (Bobby Cannavale) and his associate the Crab, someone with pincers for arms – a role for Jason Bateman that again proves Bateman’s comically self-aware likability has never worked as well as it did in the role of Michael Bluth in TV’s Arrested Development. As ever, the comedy is mostly in the premise and the opening act when the heroine’s still-pristine loser status activates the irony and the laughs. From there on, the action needs a growing measure of seriousness, although there is some banter between the King, the Crab and the cringing henchmen subordinates, and a nice role for Marcella Lowery as Emily’s mum, hoping that Emily and Lydia might be a couple. This is by-the-numbers stuff, not quite funny enough for comedy or having enough of the crazed seriousness that marks out a successful superhero franchise. • Thunder Force is out on 9 April on Netflix.
Palm Springs review – Groundhog Day with wedding bells on	It’s an unexceptional wedding. Perhaps the cocktail bar aesthetic is a touch on the cheesy side. Perhaps there are a few sexual misadventures. Certainly a lot of beer is consumed, most of it by Nyles (Andy Samberg, excellent in a role that harnesses his comic talent but hones it into a performance of unexpected depth). But what is unusual is the location, next to a portal that leads to what Nyles nonchalantly describes as “one of those infinite time loops you might have heard of”. It’s a sly nod to the fact that cinema has been caught in this particular high concept before. But surface similarities to Groundhog Day are relegated to background noise, thanks to the crisp writing and the nihilistic bite of the humour. When we join the wedding, Nyles has already been caught in the loop for long enough to have relinquished hope and any pretence of giving a damn. But the endless inevitability is disrupted when Sarah (Cristin Milioti), sister of the bride and a velvet-eyed car crash of a woman, is sucked into the same repeated day. And the infinite grind of repetition suddenly takes on an element of fun. An insouciance of approach is evident in the film’s synthetic colour palette of Hawaiian shirt primaries and visual gags, such as the yin and yang placement of two inflatable pizza slices in a pool. But there are weightier themes. It’s a film about fatalism versus fierce and emphatic free will; settling versus risking it all. Covid brings an added resonance: what is true love, after all, if not actively aching to spend time with the person with whom you’ve been flung together for what seems like an eternity?

Sequin in a Blue Room review – illicit thrills in gay coming-of-age story	Sequin (the remarkably assured Conor Leach) is 16, but adds two years to his age to buy entry into an adult world of covert gay hookups. The no-strings connections he scrolls through on his phone during his English lessons exert a fascination which is thrillingly illicit; infinitely more exciting than the option of dates with lovesick boys his own age. Sequin’s only rule is that he never meets anyone twice. Then he encounters a handsome stranger in an anonymous sex party – located in the throbbing blue room of the title – and his quest to find the man reveals that, for all his poised appeal, Sequin is out of his depth. This feature debut from the Sydney-based writer and director Samuel Van Grinsven may tackle familiar material – gay coming-of-age stories are hardly uncommon – but it does so with a lustre and style that marks Van Grinsven out as a name to watch. Perhaps even more notable is Leach, a silky, feline presence who owns every moment that he’s on screen. On multiple VOD and virtual cinema platforms
For the Sake of Vicious review – ugly home-invasion thriller whose title says it all	Ultraviolence is too often seen as a cinematic end in itself – but the results are often ugly, boring, or both. This Canadian home-invasion thriller falls into this trap, so ferociously focused on the scent of blood that it double-kneecaps one character not once but twice: by hammer, then by gunshot. But given that co-director Gabriel Carrer’s past credits include Kill, The Demolisher, and Death on Scenic Drive, we probably shouldn’t be expecting The Bridges of Madison County here. The film starts as a mysterious and alarmingly claustrophobic three-hander: nurse Romina (Lora Burke) knocks off a long Halloween shift and comes home to find that wild-eyed Chris (Nick Smyth) has taken her landlord Alan (Colin Paradine) hostage. Chris claims Alan raped his daughter five years ago; the courts let it slide, and he wants to extract the confession that will justify him taking the ultimate revenge. “This kitchen is not a courthouse, and I am not a clerk,” says Romina. But adjudicating the truth is exactly what she must do – potentially enraging Chris, on the shortest of leashes and who may be projecting his own misdeeds on the man hogtied to a chair. Sadly, when Alan manages to call in outside help, the film drops this high-tension triangle and lets slip the dogs of gore. This squanders some impressively unhinged acting by Smyth, alternating between a rigid thousand-mile stare and surges of raving abandon that suggest an out-of-body experience. One early, promising scene in which Sarah resuscitates Alan with one hand while sweet-talking her son on the phone with the other showcases all the tension lost in the glassy-eyed – and sometimes illogically staged – bloodbath that takes over. The daft title tries to promise splatterhouse brazenness, but actually fesses up to the film’s lack of imagination. For the Sake of Vicious is released on 19 April on digital platforms.
Sensation review – sensory hacking thriller comes on like a Tesco Value Matrix	This sci-fi-laced British thriller, from Czech director Martin Grof, aims for lofty metaphysical heights but trips over its own feet. Next to the films it draws from, it’s like a Tesco Value version of The Matrix, or as if Inception was taking place in the mind of a lobotomy patient. On a tiny budget, it’s no disgrace to fall short of these illustrious inspirations, but Sensation never recovers from the fact that Grof – co-writing with Magdalena Drahovska – seems unable to tidily convey its central premise. Looking to delve into his family history, postman Andrew (Game of Thrones’ Eugene Simon) has his DNA sequenced – but is told that he is part of an elite cohort of humans with hyper-acute sensory perception. Arm-twisted into joining a training group of similarly gifted individuals at a country house retreat, he learns that his sensitivity leaves him vulnerable to having his senses “hacked” and input with false information. Cue nested realities in which, under the tutelage of an adept (Jennifer Martin) cribbed from the Wachowskis’ Woman in a Red Dress, Andrew must learn to distinguish the real from the illusory. And also to manipulate the senses of other operatives involved in some kind of global conspiracy – something nodded to in a prologue put together with as much clarity as Kanye West’s political programme. This already convoluted setup bamboozles further as it picks up speed. It’s suggested that some of the students specialise in different senses, but apart from Andrew (hearing, smell) it’s not clear who does what, and neither are the rules of how everyone interacts. If these sensorial hallucinations are entirely fake and imposed, how can some aspects be true? What’s the point of learning to dupe others if it only affects a minuscule subsection of the population? Periodic catchups from Lady Exposition (AKA Nadia, another frosty teacher, played by Emily Wyatt) fail to enlighten. Grof at least does handle the transitions between realities reasonably inventively, making good use of the ever-more-unreal City of London. There is a certain Cartesian buzz to be had from Sensation if you abandon all hope of following the plot, and let it wash over you. But that won’t help when it tries to land a final twist that is supposed to bend minds, but is more likely to exhaust patience. • Sensation is available on 16 April on digital platforms.
Be Good or Be Gone review – sharp Dublin crime thriller with deadpan charm	This ultra-low-budget feature about working-class cousins on temporary release from Dublin’s Mountjoy prison feels a bit like the sort of sketchy, acoustic-sharp Irish black comedy that Lenny Abrahamson (Adam &amp; Paul, Garage) or Martin McDonagh (from the In Bruges period) made in their early years, before they went electric and found mega-fame Stateside directing the likes of Room and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. That’s a high compliment, and possibly a teensy bit more than Be Good or Be Gone deserves, given it’s a smidge trite and over-the-top in places – but it definitely has spark. Its strongest suit is the chemistry between Les Martin (who also co-wrote the script with Paul Murphy) and impish master of deadpan Declan Mills, who play Ste and Weed respectively They’re ordinary types from Dublin’s rougher zones who, in the case of Ste, blew the chance of a sporting career by getting sucked into the world of drugs and crime. Ste’s mistakes ended up costing an old friend his life, and it looks likely things will never be right with his girlfriend Dee (Jenny Lee Masterson, bringing nuance to a thinly written role), the mother of his too-cute-to-be-true moppet of a daughter Ellie May (Grace Cahill, admittedly adorable). Consequently, Ste has at least got himself clean and off the skag, but the same can’t be said for Weed, who when we first meet him is wondering if he can smuggle heroin out of prison just to make sure he’ll have a supply. Even so, Weed has ambitions to become a high-fashion designer and is already practising how he’d walk the catwalk for his post-show bow. This is amusing because he looks and sounds just like all the other smackheads in track pants they meet, and is clearly on the wrong side of 35 to break into fashion – but nevertheless, he’s keeping an eye on those stars while lying in his gutter bed. Over the course of their sojourn outside the walls of Mountjoy, the two confront their past, get involved in an armed robbery and are brutalised by former associates looking to collect debts. Some of the side characters are a little too self-consciously quirky-cute, and it’s all tied up a bit too neatly, but this definitely has charm. • Be Good or Be Gone is released on 13 April on digital platforms.
Effie Gray review – Emma Thompson’s entertaining take on a doomed Victorian marriage	One of John Ruskin’s many achievements was single-handedly creating a modern academic industry with the ambiguous way he described his unconsummated marriage to his young Scottish bride Euphemia “Effie” Gray. In the course of legal correspondence connected to their divorce, the great Victorian critic claimed there were “circumstances in her person” which disgusted him. Did that mean her pubic hair? Was he just reacting hysterically to her general nakedness? Was she eating chips in bed? Either way, Ruskin launched a million PhDs on Victorian sexuality, and now Emma Thompson has written an unexpectedly entertaining movie about this marital disaster and Gray’s subsequent romance with the painter John Everett Millais. It’s a little hammy and soapy, with an occasional Pythonesque sense of its own importance but this film, directed by Richard Laxton, is performed with gusto. As Effie herself, Dakota Fanning carries off the role competently, though with the American actor’s habit of playing British accents too slowly. Greg Wise does a good villainous turn as the obnoxious Ruskin: an obtuse and petulant Casaubon creep with a possible abuser’s taste for the green and unripe flesh. Julie Walters steals every scene as Ruskin’s overbearing mother, who turns Effie’s early married life into a grisly Rebecca nightmare. Effie Gray is re-released on 19 April on digital platforms.
I Blame Society review – film-maker turns serial killer in uneven black comedy	Here’s a self-conscious black comedy from LA film-maker Gillian Wallace Horvat which is precariously balanced on the funny/annoying fulcrum. As Mickey Rooney might have said to Judy Garland: “Let’s make the quirky low-budget film about the ordeal of making quirky low-budget films right here!” Horvat plays a droll version of herself, also called Gillian; her politically contentious script about Israel fails to get funding so she falls back on an idea she’s had on the backburner for a while: a film about how great she’d be as a serial killer. Gillian feels that the manipulative and predatory talents she has as a director are the perfect murderer skillset. Or is it that the nightmare of film-making fills her with murderous rage, along with the resentful rage she already feels towards a certain young woman she nicknames “Stalin”? Heaven knows, her career is at an impasse. Gillian’s manager isn’t interested in her, and she is forced to take meetings with obnoxious film bros who call her work “Weird Frances Ha”. (Not entirely inaccurate, incidentally.) So using hidden cameras, and developing an unlikely talent for burglary, Gillian shoots a snuff-horror odyssey on spec in which she stars as a real-life killer. And sometimes this film is genuinely quite funny – especially when Gillian fastidiously breaks into someone’s apartment and effectively dresses the set to be a movie crime scene. She also picks up a homeless person and asks him if he’s ever been on a film set before. “I thought you might be a former child star or something.” At first meandering, the film does have a kind of sociopath narrative arc as Gillian becomes more adept and confident at killing, although the no-budget aesthetic gets it into difficulties – there appears to be a continuity issue when two different characters wear the exact same T-shirt. Despite the title, Gillian doesn’t blame society. Unapologetic from first to last, she clearly doesn’t think “blame” is relevant. • I Blame Society is released on 19 April on digital platforms.
Auggie review – watchable hi-tech satire doesn’t quite know what to say	The face of American character actor Richard Kind – melancholy, hangdog, a little dyspeptic – is exactly right for this high-concept midlife satire from director and co-writer Matt Kane. It’s a variation on a familiar theme the time is the near future and Kind plays Felix, an architect in his 60s who has been pushed out of the firm he helped build and is now at home grumpily adjusting to unwanted retirement. His busy wife and grownup daughter have no great need of him these days so poor, emasculated Felix takes comfort in his hi-tech retirement gift: a pair of “Auggie” glasses, through which the wearer can see an “augmented reality companion”, a virtual-reality hologram of exactly the kind of submissively understanding person your subconscious wants to see – in Felix’s case, an extremely attractive young woman (played by newcomer Christen Harper). Felix understands that this is just a projection, a geisha hallucination programmed to respond with the right answers and expressions. But inevitably he begins to fall in love with her, and toys with the “extra” that Auggie owners are invited to purchase: a pair of hi-tech underpants that will allow him to feel his Auggie companion intimately, while his wife is out all day at her prestigious job. This is a movie comparable to Spike Jonze’s Her, in which Joaquin Phoenix falls in love with the Siri-type computer voice played by Scarlett Johansson, and Alex Garland’s Ex Machina, in which Domhnall Gleeson is entranced by the AI robot played by Alicia Vikander; and like those films it creates a dreamy mood of indulgent comedy. Auggie is squeamish about straying into out-and-out nightmare or complete black-comic absurdity, and in fact it isn’t as interesting as Michael Almereyda’s Marjorie Prime with Jon Hamm as the VR hologram of an elderly woman’s late husband, recreated in his younger years. Maybe inevitably, this movie doesn’t quite know where to go after the initial premise, but Kind is watchable as the self-pitying and pathetic Felix. • Auggie is released on 19 April on digital platforms.
Henry Glassie: Field Work review – hypnotic glimpses of folk art in the making	There’s an unmistakable slow-cinema vibe to this scrupulously observational documentary, which seems somehow to go on for weeks despite its 100-minute running time. The ostensible subject matter is American anthropologist Henry Glassie, who is college professor emeritus in folklore and ethnomusicology at Indiana University; but it isn’t really “about” him in any conventional sense. Instead, the documentary, directed by Irish film-maker Pat Collins, invites us to experience Glassie’s methods for ourselves, in extended sequences in which it simply watches artists at work, seemingly in real time as they sculpt religious icons, build giant coil pots, weave carpets. The accent is very much on “folk” creators – people with little formal art education, rooted in a community, and whose work is (largely) to serve a function, rather than purely aesthetic. Well, it’s fascinating and hypnotic to watch, and for most of the film Glassie, with his luxuriant Mark Twain moustache, is glimpsed only briefly, sitting in the corner of the frame, taking notes, or snapping the odd picture, or, like us, simply watching. The film follows in his decades-old tracks, starting off with Brazilian metal workers and woodcarvers, visits an Anatolian village that makes traditional rugs, and ends up in County Fermanagh where, in the 70s, Glassie recorded the history and music of this border community. The film also stops off in Glassie’s original stomping ground in Appalachia, but it’s a little hard to equate the current inhabitants – slickly professional ceramicists occupying top-of-the-range wooden shed workshops – with the down-at-heel creatives elsewhere. Glassie does, eventually, outline what motivates him, and his love for both witnessing the creative process and mapping the communities where it takes place is evident in what he himself describes as his “terrible sincerity”. “I don’t study people,” he says. “I stand with people and study the things they create.” His watchwords, he adds, are “reverence and patience” – both qualities, I suspect, that you will need to get the most out of this brave, unusual film. • Henry Glassie: Field Work is released on 16 April on digital platforms.
Veins of the World review – arresting portrait of nomadic life	Veins of the World sees Mongolian director Byambasuren Davaa, whose debut, The Story of the Weeping Camel, earned an Oscar nomination for best documentary, again turn her evocative, naturalistic lens on to the lives of nomadic tribes in her home country. It’s something of a pity that, having made its festival rounds, the film gets its release during the pandemic, as its arresting, expansive portraiture of Mongolian rural landscapes would have made an indelible impact on the big screen. Right from the beginning, an alluringly green vista takes over the frame; the potency of the land is breathtaking. Nevertheless, amid this poetic lushness, barren patches slowly appear. Not only the fertile soil but also a traditional way of life is in danger of being eaten away. Shattering changes are seen through the eyes of 11-year-old Amra (Bat-Ireedui Batmunkh), who is especially close to his mechanic father, Erdene (Yalalt Namsrai); Erdene leads his fellow nomads in their resistance against the encroachments of mining companies. Unfortunately, tragedy strikes and Amra’s childlike innocence hardens into a resolute determination as he becomes a one-boy-army against the destructive forces of modern commerce. With a location as awe-inspiring as the Gobi desert, there’s always a danger that the setting will overshadow the drama, but Batmunkh’s committed performance is an emotional anchor that keeps the film clear of maudlin abstraction. Though dealing with overexploitation on a giant scale – these mining operations have even emptied rivers – Veins of the World is more interested in documenting the rituals of nomadic life. Amra visits the holy shaman tree, which bears witness not only to the child’s familial trauma but also to the damage being wreaked daily on his ancestral land; this tenderness renders the desecration of the environment even more heartless and shocking. Though perhaps naive in its understanding of systematic exploitation, Veins of the World is intimate and sweeping all at once, and has at its core a sincerity that invites genuine empathy. •Veins of the World is available on 13 April on YourScreen.
Belarus culture workers need our support after detention of Tatsiana Hatsura-Yavorskaya | Mark Cousins	The arrest in Belarus of the director of Minsk’s Watch Docs festival of nonfiction cinema is a reminder of how much culture workers matter in authoritarian states and at times of information deficit. On 5 April Tatsiana Hatsura-Yavorskaya’s home was searched by security forces, phones and computers were confiscated, and she was arrested. The ostensible reason was that she had co-organised (with Natalia Trenina and Yulya Semenchenko, who were also arrested but since released) an exhibition called The Machine Is Breathing, I Am Not about Belarus health professionals at the time of Covid-19. Following the arrests the online exhibition closed. On 8 April, a court fined Hatsura-Yavorskaya 700 Belarusian rubles for “protesting against police”. Another criminal case is now being prepared, accusing her of “raising money for protests”. In 2019, Hatsura-Yavorskaya visited the Belfast film festival at the invitation of Irish writer Laurence McKeown. The result was an exchange of films between Belarus, Britain and Ireland. As chair of the Belfast film festival and its sister organisation Docs Ireland, I went to Hatsura-Yavorskaya’s Watch Docs festival, and wrote about it for the Guardian. I was deeply impressed by how Tatsiana, a humanitarian activist and mother of four, steered her festival through the storm of KGB intervention, censorship and outright banning of films. Audiences were large and hungry for stories and perspectives outwith those of the state media. We at the Belfast film festival and Docs Ireland call on the authorities in Belarus to release Hatsura-Yavorskaya. And we ask other documentary film festivals, film workers and humanitarians to do the same. Tag @BelfastFilmFes1 on Twitter and we will retweet to the relevant authorities. Nonfiction cinema is our lingua franca. Those who speak it to governments should be defended.
When Jeff Tried to Save the World review – slacker movie is an underachiever	Straight out of film school, aged 22, while her peers were off interning, Kendall Goldberg directed her feature debut, this offbeat, earnest movie about a quarter-life crisis (released in the US in 2018). That’s an undeniably impressive achievement, and the film has some interesting ideas about overparenting and how grown-up kids can buckle under the pressure of Mum and Dad’s expectations. But otherwise it feels a bit generic – shuffling the pack of quirky indie movie cliches, not quite funny enough to be a comedy but with too little authentic emotion to work as drama. Jon Heder plays Jeff, the manager of Winky’s World, a bowling alley so poorly maintained that it’s acquired a kind of retro-chic. Jeff is an underachiever, a computer science graduate who takes medication for depression and anxiety. (Heder’s performance is a bit flat – like he sees depression as a giant vacuum cleaner that has sucked away Jeff’s personality.) The job at Winky’s suits Jeff; he likes the routine, it makes him feel safe. But the owner is threatening to sell, so Jeff decides to turn the business into a going concern, with free pizza and live music. This stuff is only ever mildly entertaining, though there’s a funny scene where he persuades the maintenance guy (Steve Berg doing a Zach Galifianakis) to trash-talk Winky’s to potential buyers. The more interesting scenes involve Jeff’s relationship with his prickly sister, trainee doctor Lindy (Anna Konkle) who shows up to crash on his floor with a friend. It turns out that everyone in his family believes that Jeff is a high-flying computer programmer. The suggestion, not fully explored, is that his self-esteem has been crushed by his demanding parents, who seem to have labelled him “the clever one” when the kids were small. His sister confesses to competing with him for their attention: “I had to get into med school to prove that I existed.” It’s a genuinely moving scene in a film where the actors often look like they’re mimicking real feelings. • When Jeff Tried to Save the World is available on Sky on 13 April.
Oscars in talks to use BFI Southbank for Academy Awards show	The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (Ampas) is in talks with the British Film Institute (BFI) to use the latter’s cinema complex, BFI Southbank, as part of the forthcoming Oscars ceremony, according to a report in Variety. Citing “multiple sources”, Variety says that Ampas is looking to use BFI Southbank, in London’s Waterloo, as one of the international “hubs” for its awards show, which is due to take place on Sunday 25 April in Los Angeles. Ampas was forced to change tack from its original plans for a “no Zoom” show after complaints that non-US based nominees would not be able to attend due to Covid regulations, and instead decided to set up a series of overseas event locations to allow participation for those unable to travel. France will have a “hub” at a studio in Paris. If the London event goes ahead, it is likely to take place in the early hours of Monday 26 April, due to the time difference, and controls will be in place to ensure Covid compliance. These will include negative Covid tests, quarantine for non-UK participants, and a restriction on guest numbers. UK-based nominees include actors Carey Mulligan, Daniel Kaluuya and Anthony Hopkins, and director Emerald Fennell. However, government regulations state that “attendees converging on and congregating in a site for a specific discrete performance or activity” are still banned, so any large scale indoor event may require special permission.
Portal review – close encounters of the disappointing kind	Here’s a close encounter of the disappointing kind, an anthology movie featuring a trio of sci-fi shorts from the crew behind the V/H/S horror films. Released in the US as Doors but renamed Portal for the UK, the three films together tell an alien-contact story set on Earth after a million portals open up – giant doors that look like they’re covered with shimmery iron-filings from school science experiments. Whatever planet they hail from, the portals do not appear to come in peace; half the world’s population vanish into them. The best of the shorts is number three, titled Lamaj, which stars TV on the Radio’s Kyp Malone as Jamal, a gentle and thoughtful scientist with a lustrous beard who lives alone in a cabin in the woods. Like Amy Adams’s linguist character in Arrival, Jamal communicates with the portals, and invites another scientist – his ex – over to share the moment. They stand there, eyes shining, faces radiant with the pure pleasure of scientific discovery. Then the cops turn up. The second segment, Knockers by Saman Kesh, is the flimsiest. It’s set weeks after the portals’ appearance, when teams of young gung-ho volunteers are being sent into the portals for research. They have 12 minutes inside to gather data; stay any longer and they risk getting “doors psychosis”. It’s a nonsensical film shot with Michel Gondry-style visual trickery, following two volunteers, a young couple (played by Lina Esco and Josh Peck), having a bad trip in a portal. The opener depicts the arrival, that apocalyptic moment when everyone realises Something is Wrong. It’s filmed from the point of view of a bunch of kids in detention – seriously freaked out when birds start slamming against the window, military helicopters buzzing overhead. The three pieces of the science-fiction puzzle fit together to make a bland, incurious picture with little awe at the universe. • Portal is released on 19 April on digital platforms
The Reckoning review – witch movie descends into misogynistic torture ordeal	Here’s a deeply unpleasant and misogynistic horror about a woman accused of witchcraft, made in the image of Game of Thrones by British film-maker Neil Marshall (who has directed episodes of GoT). It starts off inoffensively, if shonkily. The year is 1665; the setting might be Essex or perhaps Yorkshire – the characters are a mix of blunt northerners and Essex chappies. Charlotte Kirk (co-writer of the script with Marshall) stars as farmer’s wife Grace Haverstock, whose husband hangs himself after being infected with bubonic plague. “I’m sorry for your loss,” says the landlord of the local boozer; the dialogue is a laughable mashup of modern and ye olden medieval. Grace is raw with grief – though it’s hard to tell from Kirk’s one-expression-fits-all wooden performance. (The costume and makeup departments don’t help, styling her like she’s modelling the cover of a Mills &amp; Boon cover, bodice ripe for the ripping, hair teased to a salon flick.) The village squire (Steven Waddington) accuses Grace of witchcraft after she rejects his advances, and calls in infamous witchfinder John Moorcroft (Sean Pertwee), a predictably pious hypocrite who arrives with a sinister cloaked female servant, Ursula (Suzanne Magowan), at his side. Up until this point, The Reckoning is merely ropey. Then Grace is strapped into a torture device and has a muzzle-like metal mask put over her face (presumably so that the audience can gawp at her being tortured without having to deal with seeing her agony). The witchfinder orders Ursula to turn Grace into a pincushion with tiny daggers. On day four, still not confessing, she is raped with an instrument that looks like a smear-test speculum but splays open to inflict grievous internal injuries. Late on in the third act, Grace gets her revenge – though how she can rampage around slaying after being tortured for days is never explained. The film left me shaking with anger more than fear. • The Reckoning is released on 16 April on digital platforms.
Steelers review – doc tackles queer rugby’s small moments and big struggles	There’s overwhelming precedent in film for the separation of LGBTQ stories and those told within the world of sport – two often diametrically opposed parts of life with very little crossover. What crossover there is has often been reductive or bleak, either poking fun or revealing a dark underbelly of intolerance and players forced to remain in the closet. It makes the prospect of optimistic documentary Steelers: The World’s First Gay and Inclusive Rugby Club much more welcome – and a way to modernise a musty narrative. Steelers is a modest film, both in production values and scope, in ways that sometimes work and sometimes don’t: the affecting small moments are often in need of a bigger picture to make them soar. It’s made by one of the London-based club’s former players, Australian reporter Eammon Ashton-Atkinson, who is narrator, director, writer and editor, telling the story of three queer people involved with the team as they compete against other gay clubs in the Bingham Cup. He teases out some moving testimonies and provides a stinging reminder for many straight viewers that coming out isn’t always the happy ending many think it is, and there are still wounds that need to heal over. But the structure is disjointed, flipping around without confidence, from scrappily shot one-on-ones with players to mostly B-roll footage taken at the Bingham Cup. The gameplay scenes aren’t quite immersive enough and the film is missing historical context: how this team – and gay rugby – went from a punchline to an industry. The limited focus leaves Steelers seeming more like promotional material for the club than standalone documentary. It’s clearly made on a shoestring budget and, while well-intentioned, it’s a little too half-baked to land. Best met with a polite clap rather than a hearty cheer. • Steelers is released on 16 April on Amazon Prime Video.
Into the Labyrinth review – Dustin Hoffman psycho-thriller goes down a rabbit hole	A face-off between Hollywood legend Dustin Hoffman and Toni Servillo, that veteran of contemporary Italian classics by Paolo Sorrentino? Sounds good. But sadly, the two never appear together in the same scene, and the film they appear in is frustratingly underpowered and derivative. Into the Labyrinth is a psychological horror-thriller directed by Donato Carrisi and adapted by him from his own bestselling novel L’uomo del labirinto. The setting is Italy, and a distraught young woman (Valentina Bellè) comes round from sedation in a private hospital room where a calm and mysterious doctor called Green (Hoffman) explains that she had been found, dumped unconscious by the side of the road, apparently by the sinister individual who kidnapped her as a teenager 15 years earlier – a sensational unsolved “cold case”. As a forensic profiler working with the police, he will now ask questions to reconstruct her terrifying existence in the prison which her abductor called the “labyrinth”. At which point the audience is entitled to ask: erm, why are they speaking in English, when all the rest of dialogue is in Italian? Did she learn English in captivity? Meanwhile, a bleary private detective called Bruno Genko (played by Servillo), specialising in banal cases of debt recovery, hears about this young woman’s safe return and finds that it is now his own mysterious destiny to track down her kidnapper who apparently likes to wear a huge rabbit mask – as in the film Donnie Darko. There is some incidental interest in the bizarre comic-book settings and locations and indeed the weird comic book called “Bunny” which appears to have inspired the crazed villain himself. But the narrative focus is damagingly and pointlessly split between Servillo and Hoffman, two actors whose considerable screen presences tend to subtract from each other. And the cheat-twist ending is basically all too familiar. • Into the Labyrinth is released on 19 April on digital platforms.
Happy Happy Joy Joy: The Ren and Stimpy Story review – disturbing scenes	Here is a documentary whose title contains radioactive levels of irony: happiness and joy are very far from what is to be found within. It is a behind-the-scenes profile of the pioneering TV animation Ren and Stimpy, which for those not around in the early 90s, featured an angry chihuahua (Ren) and a dopey, good-natured cat (Stimpy); with its hyper-stylised visuals, bad-taste humour and eye-watering violence, it found a cult status as a mould-breaking kidult show – very much at the adult end of the scale. The film is built around a profile of John Kricfalusi, Ren and Stimpy’s creator and mastermind; presumably it started out as a warts-and-all account of Kricfalusi’s eccentric (to say the least) management style, which culminated in his firing by Nickelodeon in 1992, shortly after the show’s second season began. However, whatever intentions directors Ron Cicero and Kimo Easterwood may have had were upended by the emergence of even more serious accusations: claims of grooming and underage sex, for which he subsequently apologised. Faced with scrapping everything and starting again, Cicero and Easterwood have folded the material into the litany of alleged abusive behaviour in his studio: initially tolerated as mad-genius enthusiasm but evolving into nasty control-freakery. Kricfalusi is interviewed at length (he apparently agreed only after his victims went to the media), as is Robin Byrd, one of his principal accusers. The result makes for an unbalanced final film; even if Kricfalusi emerges as a thoroughly unpleasant, if damaged, character, giving him the room to apologise (again) for sexual abuse has the effect of suggesting that somehow that’s the end of it, and even that it was the result of aberrations triggered by workplace stress. Happy Happy Joy Joy is a dismal coda to a fondly remembered show, with Kricfalusi’s collaborators still distressed over what happened. As one of his co-workers put it: “No one else worked harder to fuck it up than this guy.” • Happy Happy Joy Joy: The Ren and Stimpy Story is available on 16 April on True Story.
Ride or Die review – bloody revenge and blossoming love in shocking Japanese thriller	The prolific director Ryūichi Hiroki has carved out a niche in modern Japanese cinema with his willingness to delve into the darker sides of sexuality. Following a start in the softcore “pink” films, He has moved to the mainstream while exploring subjects such as sadomasochism. Ride or Die, a live-action adaptation of Ching Nakamura’s arresting but disquieting manga series Gunjō, fits perfectly in the director’s transgressive wheelhouse. The moods of Ride or Die alternate between neon-lit cityscapes and sun-drenched open roads. The opening is shockingly baptised in blood: Rei (Kiko Mizuhara), a twentysomething lesbian, has slashed a man to death in his own home. It is later revealed that her victim is the abusive husband of Nanae (Honami Sato), a high-school classmate for whom Rei has held a torch for a decade. In perhaps the most destructive possible declaration of love, Rei has killed for Nanae, and together they embark on a getaway that doubles as a journey to their past. The bloodshed carries a poetic power: the life of a (bad) man is taken, only for the two women to see themselves reborn. Ride or Die is well-made and engrossing, despite its occasionally meandering pace. Texas-born Mizuhara, currently Japan’s most celebrated It girl, is hugely charismatic on screen. It is a pity that the film has damped down the pitch-black humour and sense of apathy found in its source material; the two women are designed to be much more obviously likable, their rough edges softened and the toxicity in their relationship diluted. The conspicuous use of easy listening tunes on the soundtrack doesn’t help, either. In the end though, Ride or Die boasts strong performances, and its beautiful cinematography takes viewers from metropolitan restlessness to the liberating seaside. • Ride or Die is available on Netflix.
Ip Man: Kung Fu Master review – stylish martial arts potboiler	For those not up to date with the martial arts film canon, Ip Man was a real historical figure: a master of Wing Chun, a type of southern Chinese kung fu, who until relatively recently was best known for having trained the great Bruce Lee. The real Ip died just before Lee in 1972, but his colourful life has since served as a basis for a series of films that have taken varying amounts of liberty with the facts, starting with the Donnie Yen vehicle Ip Man from 2008. In these films, Ip is more than just a historical figure: he’s a legendary character, a fighter for justice against rogue criminals and sinister foreigners, especially in the films that focus on his years as a policeman in Foshan after the second world war, before the communists came to power and Ip and his family left for Hong Kong. Conversely, in Wong Kar-Wai’s The Grandmaster, Ip serves as a vehicle for a languorous contemplation of martial arts philosophy. Scads more have followed of varying quality, and this latest one features Dennis To, playing the character for the third time, in the Foshan policeman stage of the story. To be honest, To is a less engaging performer than Yen, but his moves are nifty and director Li Liming films the fight scenes – which really make up most of the movie – with plenty of style. Li is very keen on crosscutting between quiet and noisy interactions during the fights; in the opening battle, for instance, between Ip and dozens of axe-wielding gangsters, his superior officer (Michael Wong) plays chess upstairs against a foe with the moves in both forms of combat paralleling each other. There’s some ace drunken-style fighting later, and inventive use of props, but the film takes itself a bit too seriously and reshuffles the deck of plot tropes instead of inventing its own ideas. Ultimately, it feels about as meaningful as a pop video, but if you enjoy martial arts films the way others like, say, dance films, it’s pleasant viewing. Ip Man: Kung Fu Master is released on 19 April on digital platforms.
Valley of Souls review –  quietly devastating Colombian drama	“I thank those who have agreed to revisit these dark times,” reads the title card that closes this drama about a fisherman’s harrowing journey to retrieve the bodies of his two sons. Set in 2002, in the middle of the United Self-Defence Forces of Colombia’s (AUC’s) reign of terror, the film sees José (José Arley de Jesús Carvallido Lobo) drift downriver in his solitary canoe, scouring the debris that has washed up on the beach in search of clues. He knows it is forbidden to remove bodies from their unmarked grave – the otherwise gorgeous Magdalena river. José’s personal quest mirrors the political project of the Belgian-Colombian writer and director Nicolás Rincón Gille; both seek to preserve those who have disappeared under the AUC’s regime. It’s a devastating film, but doesn’t revel in the story’s inherent grimness. In one terrifying, tragicomic scene, José is brought face to face with a paramilitary chief who is obsessed with the Tour de France. Happily, his knowledge of this shared cultural reference ends up saving his life. Gille, who has a background in documentary film-making, pays particular attention to the natural beauty of the Bolívar region, choosing to foreground José’s stoicism instead of the way his life has been ravaged by violence. Lobo, too, is radiant, a pillar of strength holding steady amid a storm of grief. On Mubi
Cranston Academy: Monster Zone review – colourful if derivative Hogwartsian animation	The two nominal main characters of this derivative but reasonably amusing computer-animated feature are a pair of teenage kids attending an elite Hogwartsian science school called Cranston Academy in London; the location signified by the fact it rains all the time and the teachers drink tea. Awkward American Danny (voiced, puzzlingly, by British actor Jamie Bell), who prefers to work solo, is forcibly teamed up with prissy but whipsmart Liz from Australia (Ruby Rose). Together, they get the school’s nuclear reactor working, but it opens up a portal to another dimension. This Promethean class project unleashes all manner of monsters, many of whom recall the creatures in Pixar’s Monsters, Inc. but with less affable personalities. The production, directed by Leopoldo Aguilar, emanates from Mexican cartoon studio Anima Estudios, which is interesting because only a tiny amount of animation comes out of the third country in North America, compared with the US and Canada. That also explains why, out of an already culturally eclectic cast of characters, a Mexican scientist is assigned the key role of semi-magical helper character. Known only as Mothman (voiced by Idzi Dutkiewicz) – he’s half-human, half-moth – he speaks the human language with a heavy Spanish accent and also sports wings and has a overwhelming urge to whisper sweet nothings to every lamp and torch he meets, like a lumophilic insectoid Pepé Le Pew. His heritage also allows for one of the funnier gags wherein Mothman, Danny and Liz go to a British “Mexican” restaurant and Mothman is utterly horrified by the atrocities described as “tacos” on the menu. The palette of hot, supersaturated colours is toned down by the use of more subdued tones for the night scenes, and while the character animation is not especially winning, neither is it annoying like too many other cartoon features these days. • Cranston Academy: Monster Zone is available on 19 April on Sky Cinema.
Clapboard Jungle review – confessions of an indie horror film director	Justin McConnell is a Canadian indie director who has here created what amounts to a tiring and self-indulgent video diary of the last five years as he tries to get his passion project made (a fantasy horror called Lifechanger). It is interspersed with what feels like hundreds of thousands of interviews with beaming film people, some very famous (such as Paul Schrader and Guillermo Del Toro), some not so famous, but all giving us their well-meant platitudes about getting your films made by following your dream and realising that it’s all about storytelling. Clapboard Jungle suffers from a weird mix of information overload and a lack of actual, usable information that might be of assistance to film-makers or of interest to film audiences. To an extraordinary degree, this film is packed with endless selfie shots of McConnell’s face as – zonked with stress or anxiety or disappointment – he trudges through airport department lounges on his way to festivals, placidly listens to music on a bus, or takes calls from producers and distributors passing on his project. This isn’t to say that there aren’t some nuggets of information here about the nightmare of independent film production: the money people won’t commit the cash until the talent are definitely on board and the talent won’t sign up until the money is definitely there. So something has to give and someone has to be lied to. At one stage, an actor who’s worked with McConnell gently reproves him about exaggerating the extent and solidity of the funding while the film was in development. But that is the business. As ever, people complain about the deluge of “content” which is sloshing over us all nowadays. Advances in digital technology have made it easier and cheaper to make films, but it hasn’t increased film-making talent or increased the number of people willing to watch the finished product. There is some good sense from Troma’s Lloyd Kaufman: “Nobody complained when there were thousands of paintings and drawings and comic book illustrations – why should anyone complain about too many movies?” • Clapboard Jungle is available on 19 April.
True Mothers review – tender Japanese adoption drama	The Japanese film-maker Naomi Kawase adapts Mizuki Tsujimura’s 2015 novel in this tender, compassionate drama about the complexities of motherhood. Satoko (Hiromi Nagasaku), the adoptive mother of six-year-old Asato (Reo Sato), is thrown into crisis when a young woman claiming to be her son’s biological mother attempts to blackmail her. The film mostly plays out in flashback, giving context to each mother’s “truth”, and equal weight to both women’s sacrifices. “Baby Baton”, the charity that connects the two, requires Satoko to quit her job and pledge to become a full-time parent, while 14-year-old Hikari (Aju Makita) is told to legally agree to permanently sever all ties with her newborn son. Kawase’s frequent use of handheld camera gives parts of the film a quasi-documentary feel, but it’s the lyrical touches, such as a beam of blinding sunlight that falls on Satoko and her husband after signing the adoption papers, and an oceanic soundscape that recurs throughout, that hit the hardest.

Groundswell review – the fight against fracking in Ireland	In 2010, the American film-maker Josh Fox released something that in retrospect looks like one of the most influential and original documentaries of recent times: GasLand. It was about something new to many at the time: fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, under the earth to release natural gas from shale rock, at the risk of polluting the water table and turning areas of natural beauty into sludge dumps – and that is aside from the existing larger implications of gas consumption. The film alerted many to a new environmental menace, and it plays its historic role in this new film from Johnny Gogan about the anti-fracking campaign in Ireland, often by people who were energised by seeing GasLand and determined to resist what one campaigner calls the new way of “scraping the bottom of the fossil-fuel barrel”. Exactly so. The coronavirus pandemic has, understandably, diverted many people’s attention from the climate crisis. But there is no vaccination for climate change. Groundswell shows how the fracking industry has been developing its interests in Ireland for many years, especially in North Leitrim, the corporations clearly calculating that it is unlikely to muster much protest because it is so sparsely populated. But communities did come together, with artists and writers joining the movement, and the Irish campaigners have been able to make international common cause with their equivalents in the United States, and draw on their knowledge. Ireland made history by banning not just fracking but also by importing fracked gas, and the fracking corporations are now pursuing their business over the border in Northern Ireland. A lesson to communities and campaigners there and everywhere else to stay vigilant. • Groundswell is released on 16 April on digital platforms.
Star Wars: Darth Vader actor David Prowse’s items up for auction 	The lots up for auction include an iconic movie script (minus a crucial plot spoiler), a mask that has terrified generations of sci-fi fans and even a chunk of a beloved starship. More than 700 possessions of David Prowse, the Bristolian who played Darth Vader in the original Star Wars trilogy, are being sold off in his home city following his death aged 85 last year. Included is his The Empire Strikes Back script, which has key lines removed to keep Vader’s relationship with Luke Skywalker secret, a piece of the Millennium Falcon’s cockpit and a Vader mask Prowse is believed to have used for appearances at conventions and events. Appropriately, the collection will be sold on 4 May – a nod to the franchise’s famous line: “May the force be with you.” Auctioneer Andrew Stowe, of East Bristol Auctions, said: ‘‘When I was rummaging through the boxes from his house, every now and then I’d come across something special and it would send my brain racing. “In one box I’d find his Empire Strikes Back script, in another I found an actual piece of the Millennium Falcon, then a little deeper down I’d find a letter from Peter Cushing.” The Empire Strikes Back script is expected to sell for thousands. ‘‘My spine tingled when I first saw the script,” said Stowe. But the line revealing Vader and Luke’s relationship does not feature. Stowe said: “The reveal – perhaps the most recognised moment in cinema history – was kept a big secret from most of the cast. As Prowse’s lines would be over-dubbed by James Earl Jones he [Prowse] wasn’t privy to the secret, so instead, he was given alternate dialogue which is considerably less dramatic. But that in itself makes this a unique piece of history.’’ A percentage of proceeds from the auction will go to Alzheimer’s Research UK.
Downton Abbey film sequel set for Christmas 2021 release	A sequel to the successful spin-off film from Julian Fellowes’ Downton Abbey TV series will be released this Christmas. The as yet untitled film began shooting last week, with all key cast members – including Hugh Bonneville and Maggie Smith – returning alongside new faces including Hugh Dancy, Laura Haddock and Dominic West. The TV series ended with a season set during the general strike of 1926; the film was set a year and a half later, and featured a royal visit to the Yorkshire estate of Lord and Lady Grantham. Plot details for the followup film are under wraps. The 2019 film was generally well-received and grossed $194m worldwide. The plot of that movie included the revelation that Maggie Smith’s character, the dowager countess, did not have long to live. Smith, 86, will be returning for the shoot, under what are believed to be enhanced Covid precautions. West will shortly be seen playing Prince Charles in the fifth and sixth seasons of The Crown.
Sparks musical with Adam Driver and Marion Cotillard to open Cannes film festival	The rescheduled 2021 edition of the Cannes film festival has picked Annette, a new film from Holy Motors director Leos Carax and starring Marion Cotillard and Adam Driver, for its high-profile opening slot. The musical, written by Sparks duo Ron and Russell Mael, is described by the festival as “the story of Henry, a standup comedian with a fierce sense of humour, and Ann, a singer of international renown … They are the perfect couple, healthy, happy, and glamorous. The birth of their first child, Annette, a mysterious girl with an exceptional destiny, will change their lives.” It is Carax’s first English-language film and is set in Los Angeles. The film will screen in Cannes on 6 July, after the festival’s opening ceremony, and will simultaneously go on general release in France. Holy Motors, Carax’s last film, screened in competition in 2012. In January, the festival announced that its public event would be moved from its traditional mid-May date to July, after its initial plans were derailed by Covid regulations. The organisers intend to hold in-person screenings; however, cinemas in France are closed as part of a national lockdown that began on 3 April. The Cannes film market, normally held at the same time as the festival, will go ahead as a virtual event in May. The 2020 edition of the festival shelved its “physical” screening programme, replacing it instead with a selection of more than 50 films, including period fossil-hunter romance Ammonite, afterlife animation Soul and ski-competition sex-abuse drama Slalom. The festival said the rest of the selection will be announced in May. However, Cannes artistic director Thierry Frémaux has confirmed that two films from the 2020 list – Wes Anderson’s The French Dispatch, about the Paris office of an American newspaper, and Benedetta, Paul Verhoeven’s film about the real-life 17th-century lesbian nun and mystic – will be included in the 2021 lineup. Spike Lee, who was due to be jury president in 2020, will return to perform the same duties this year. The Cannes film festival is due to run 6-17 July.
Sofia review – Moroccan society through the eyes of an unwed mother	In Morocco, sex outside marriage is punishable by up to 12 months in prison. But when unmarried Sofia gives birth, in this debut feature from Meryem Benm’Barek, her family’s biggest fear is not her going to jail, it’s preserving their honour. The film is straightforward, a blunt social-realist drama. (Sofia goes into labour at a kitchen sink, while washing up.) Only at the end does it dawn on you how carefully the story is plotted: something happens that recasts everything that has gone before – and, if anything, makes the story even more grim. Maha Alemi stars as 20-year-old Sofia, who doesn’t know that she is pregnant until her waters break during a family party in Casablanca. It’s never clear whether Sofia, who didn’t gain much weight, was completely unaware of the pregnancy; perhaps she suspected it but had blocked it out. Her face is mostly blank, and she walks through the film numbed and zombie-like. After the birth, her family is disgusted – and terrified that a scandal will blow her dad’s business deal with wealthy entrepreneur named Ahmed. (Ahmed is played by Mohamed Bousbaa. Like a bit character in a murder mystery, watch him – he’ll be important later.) Everyone agrees the only solution is to find the man who got Sofia pregnant and persuade him to recognise the baby. Sofia and her rich cousin Lena (Sarah Perles) drive around to find the guy, Omar (Hamza Khafif), who turns out to be no one’s idea of a perfect son-in-law. Benm’Barek refuses to flatten her script into a simplistic tale of misogyny. This is about class, too. If you have the money and the connections, you can bypass the law. Things happen to Sofia that would never happen to middle-class, educated Lena. What a clear-eyed and pitiless film this is; it left me hankering for the chinks of tender optimism in a Ken Loach movie. • Sofia is available on 23 April on Your Screen.
Fear of Rain review – lurid horror film takes aim at mental illness stereotypes	Here’s a horror flick that wants to have its cake and eat it: combining a well-intentioned drama about teenage mental illness with a lurid potboiler. Director Castille Landon seems to be wagging her finger at films containing damaging stereotypes of mental health, while telling her own sensational and lurid story. In Florida, a high-schooler with schizophrenia becomes convinced that the woman next door is keeping a little girl locked up in her attic. Is she hallucinating, or is her neighbour a kidnapper? It opens with a nastily effective slasher movie scene: a hooded man stalks a blond teenager through a cemetery, then buries her alive in a shallow grave. The girl wakes up thrashing in a hospital bed. This is Rain (Madison Iseman), who’s had a terrifying psychotic episode after stopping her meds. Her concerned parents are played by Katherine Heigl and Harry Connick Jr; they seem to have walked in from a syrupy Nicholas Sparks adaptation, bemused and blank-faced. Back in her bedroom, Rain picks a piece of her own fingernail out of the wall, in case anyone is in any doubt how serious her illness is. At school she is a pariah. “Careful or she’ll go all Carrie on you,” jokes her ex-best friend. But gorgeous new kid Caleb (Israel Broussard) seems to dig Rain’s gorgeous-but-vulnerable vibe. “I love your brain,” he tells her. He is also willing to go along with her highly dubious theory that their single-lady English teacher, Dani (Eugenie Bondurant) – who happens to be Rain’s neighbour – has taken a child prisoner. Bondurant’s creepy performance is the highlight of the film. Landon films the angles of her androgynous face to perfection: in a certain kind of light she looks frail and caring; from another angle she’s menacing as hell. Fear of Rain won’t be winning any awards for mental health awareness with its silly hash of psychology, packaging up illness to fit the schlock’n’shock of the story. But there are a couple of ludicrous twists at the end that make it very watchable. • Fear of Rain is released on 26 April on digital platforms.
The Oak Room review – bar-room tales brew up a storm	Several men walk into several bars in this interlocking suite of tales, and the repeating permutations of barman and barfly, blue collar and white collar, father and son, raconteur and listener pile up pleasingly into a kind of oppressive, Coenesque cosmic joke. RJ Mitte, Breaking Bad’s Walter White Jr, plays college boy Steve, who turns up in a snowstorm at a bar owned by the irascible Paul (Peter Outerbridge). He owes the latter money – and without it, Paul won’t give up the ashes of Steve’s recently deceased dad, Gord, whose funeral the youth failed to attend. And then this arrogant sadsack – whose very presence aggravates Paul – offers to pay him with a story. Steve’s yarn is a slack spin on his own: a freezing wayfarer walks into The Oak Room, a pub in a neighbouring town, and puts a set of demands to an irked barman. Unimpressed, Paul tells him that he must learn to “goose the truth” to hold an audience, and then sucker-punches him with a story about Gord, with another story inside. Or he thinks it’s a sucker-punch – Steve reveals that he had only told the ending of his, and the start will transform everything. Adapted from Peter Genoway’s stage play by the playwright himself, the film is almost completely dialogue-reliant and initially a bit wearing. But as the tales gather weight like snow on a roof, and intriguing correspondences accumulate, the impressive structuring tells. What at first appear to be rather impoverished visuals from Canadian director Cody Calahan – a window of storm-blown exterior the only respite from bar-room wood – starts feeling like an uncomfortably tight grip. It’s not immediately clear what deeper point this suffocating proliferation is making, but perhaps it is about control: whose narrative gets to predominate, who in this countertop-sparring full of filial issues is the “daddy”. Or perhaps ultimately no one is, and in this infinite story regression, we are all equally – as Gord concludes – in hell. TV veteran Outerbridge strategically overplays, allowing the seemingly callow and flaky Mitte to come to the fore. This sharply crafted piece talks the talk and finally threatens to walk the walk. • The Oak Room is available on 26 April on digital platforms.
Golden Globes crisis continues as former president sends anti-BLM email	Already under fire for its failings over membership diversity, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), the organisation behind the Golden Globes, has been forced to apologise after its former long-term president emailed a copy of an article to members that called Black Lives Matter a “racist hate group”. According to the LA Times, Phil Berk, who served eight terms as the HPFA president, ending in 2011, shared a copy of an article from rightwing website Frontpagemag.com, which described Black Lives Matter as a “racist … hate group” and claimed that the movement is carrying out the “race war” that Charles Manson aspired to start. In its statement, the HFPA said: “The views expressed in the article circulated by Mr Berk are those of the author of the article and do not – in any way shape or form – reflect the views and values of the HFPA. The HFPA condemns all forms of racism, discrimination and hate speech and finds such language and content unacceptable.” The LA Times reported that a number of HFPA members responded angrily to Berk’s email, with one writing “The vile rhetoric contained in this screed is simply unacceptable”, and another calling Berk “a thundering disgrace”. The crisis engulfing the HFPA began shortly before the Golden Globes award ceremony in January, when an LA Times report accused the organisation of a lack of diversity in its membership as well as “ethical lapses” in the way it conducted its business. The HFPA’s subsequent pledge to add “Black and other underrepresented professionals to [the] organisation” and improve “transparency” over its voting and membership processes, was deemed inadequate by high-profile film industry campaign group Time’s Up. In March a large group of influential Hollywood PR agencies said they would boycott the Golden Globes, the primary source of the HFPA’s income, unless the HFPA made “profound and lasting change”.
Homeward review – Crimean Tatars on a heartbreaking odyssey	In Homeward, personal and collective pains weave together to make a quietly searing work. Nariman Aliev’s directorial debut depicts the rootlessness of the Crimean Tatars, as well as his own personal history of displacement. Though having a cross-country odyssey at the centre of its narrative, the film acutely understands what many road trip movies have missed: for marginalised people, the open road rarely equates to freedom. In fact, the Tatars in Homeward are constantly subjected to aggressions from others as well as state surveillance. The journey begins at a place of death: the morgue. Mustafa (Akhtem Seitablaev) is here to pick up the body of his son Nazim (Anatoliy Marempolskiy) who has died in the Russo-Ukrainian war. His other son Alim (Remzi Bilyalov), a college student, sits silently on a nearby bench. It remains unclear at first that the two are related; their body language is awkward as an uneasy, tense distance lingers between them. After retrieving the body, Mustafa and Alim face numerous obstacles, both from themselves and from outsiders, as they attempt to return to Russian-annexed Crimea for the burial. Homeward makes clear that the displacement faced by the Crimean Tatars – created by centuries of forced transfer, culminating in Stalin’s huge-scale deportations in 1944 – is painfully intergenerational. The loss of a collective autonomy destroys personal relationships: Mustafa is not only estranged from his sons but also from his own brother. But there are unexpected moments of bonding. One of Homeward’s most touching scenes is when rugged and street-smart Mustafa teaches fresh-faced Alim how to use a knife. A peculiar playfulness emerges here, as if the duo are playing catch and not, in fact, practising stabbing assailants. Seitablaev delivers a particularly moving performance, navigating between brutal patriarchal machismo and devastating torment. Bilyalov, a non-professional actor, doesn’t quite achieve the same depth, but the striking visuals as well as the authenticity of the storytelling still make Homeward a compelling, heartbreaking watch. • Homeward is released on 23 April on digital platforms.
The Race to Save the World review – paying the price for climate change protest	An assortment of American climate-change activists, from teenagers to septuagenarians, are tracked over several months as they protest, get arrested and face charges in court. All the while, each of them must try to reconcile the demands of family life with their commitment to saving the planet. And each is so passionate about activism that personal relationships certainly do suffer. For example, Bill Moyer, a resident of Washington state, spends most of his time leading a campaign against fossil fuel use that involves demonstrations with kayaks – “kayaktivism” – and draping colourful banners from bridges. His teenage daughter says that she admires what her dad does but she also resents it when he’s not there for her birthday party. It becomes clear he’s missed a lot of father-daughter bonding, and making pancakes for breakfast every day for a year will only get so far in repairing the damage. Similarly, Abby Brockway, another protester parent who blocks the path of a train ferrying oil, says she would prefer to go to prison rather than get let off with community service because it would attract more attention. This is news to her husband when she announces it on camera, and he doesn’t seem pleased. There is no doubting the sincerity of these activists or the rightness of the cause they are fighting for, even though on a more granular level each is challenging a specific iniquity, such as fracking or pipelines. Is it a problem if some of them seem insufferably earnest, self righteous and annoying? It doesn’t help that director Joe Gantz seems determined to serve up these stories with lashings of soppy, emotive music and corny montages. But if the human interest angle prompts more sympathy for climate activists, surely that’s a good thing. • The Race to Save the World is released on 22 April on digital platforms.
Forget Everything and Run review – scenic zombie adventure lacks bite	It is increasingly difficult to carve out a niche in the overpopulated world of postapocalyptic survivalist movies. This low-budget effort – alternatively titled with its initials, FEAR – falls somewhere between The Walking Dead, A Quiet Place, The Revenant and It Comes at Night – but, like its central family, it struggles to find a place to call its own. The setting is a scenic, snowy, mountainous region, presumably in North America, and the opening crawl ramps up the Covid resonance: a world struck by a deadly virus, a sealed-off area where “every day we fight to survive. Hiding. Scavenging. Clinging to hope …” Thus, we are up to speed when a growling, raving, zombie-like madman comes charging through the woods at combat-ready Ethan (Jason Tobias, who co-directed and co-wrote) and his nervous son (Danny Ruiz). Back at home – though their rundown shack barely fits the description – are resourceful mum Joe (Marci Miller) and a teenage daughter who has succumbed to the zombie virus, and is strapped to a bed upstairs on life support. (The family are holding out for access to a cure.) This already precarious existence is threatened further when they are raided by marauders equipped with superior firearms and human shields. The result of their violent battle is a negotiated standoff that splits the action: Joe keeps her gun on the marauders’ scheming matriarch (a convincingly fiery Susan Moore Harmon), Ethan goes with her brother to fetch medicine and fuel from their camp. Nobody trusts anyone – nor should they. As action gives way to extended dialogue scenes and flashbacks to happier, pre-apocalypse times, the pace slackens. Characters conveniently disappear for extended stretches and questions mount about the wider scenario, which is confusingly explained but barely depicted, probably for budget reasons. The performers are mostly fine and the action is well staged, but for all its energy and commitment, the story finds nowhere to run. • Forget Everything and Run is available on 26 April on digital platforms.
Spring Blossom review – a fleeting affair with heart	How much does our appreciation of a film depend on our knowledge of the film-maker? The question is difficult to avoid with this tale of a 16-year-old schoolgirl who develops a relationship with an older man. It was made by its star, Suzanne Lindon, who wrote it when she was 15 and directed it when she was 20. Lindon is also the daughter of French actors Vincent Lindon and Sandrine Kiberlain, which some might perceive as a bit of a head start, but she certainly holds her own here. Lindon plays “Suzanne”, a student from a loving, affluent Parisian family (in appearance she resembles a young Charlotte Gainsbourg). She doesn’t lack friends, but she is bored with her immature peer group. On her walk to school every day she starts to notice Raphaël (Arnaud Valois), a handsome, 35-year-old actor performing at the local theatre. He also seems bored. Suzanne becomes curious, and the two draw closer. As much as Suzanne is mature beyond her years, Raphael seems somewhat immature – even ordering the same sugary soft drink as her at cafes. Is it possible for these two to meet somewhere in the middle? From the outside, their relationship skirts the boundaries between schoolgirl crush and sexual exploitation, but these complications are not really the story’s concern. Predominantly seen from Suzanne’s point of view, it is something more intimate, hesitant and innocent – and less cliched. For one thing, there is no overtly sexual dimension to their liaison. (As if to prove she knows the territory, Lindon includes a nod to Maurice Pialat’s 1983 movie A Nos Amours, which centred on a promiscuous 16-year-old, also named Suzanne.) Nor does the outside world particularly encroach. Lindon lets her story unfold in simple, natural strokes, aside from a few key moments where the couple’s movements morph into coordinated, choreographed dance moves. Where some might praise an Eric Rohmer-style lightness of touch, others might see a certain slightness. And at barely 70 minutes, this is a fleeting affair in every sense. Perhaps that’s the point. • Spring Blossom is released on 23 April on Curzon Home Cinema.
The Last Photograph review – Danny Huston’s faded snapshot of a father’s grief	The fiendish eyebrows that make Danny Huston so castable as a Hollywood character actor play second fiddle to his jawline – a slight droop around the jowls that lends a heaviness to his deeply felt performance as a man broken by grief. This London-set drama is Huston’s first time behind the camera in more than 20 years. Before he was an actor he was a director – just like his dad John – and he has a knack with actors, although the film is flat in places and more than a little bland. Huston is Tom Hammond, a bookshop owner and an irritable one – the sort of man who snaps rudely at a homeless person begging in a doorway. He’s first seen at home in Chelsea stashing a wad of £50 notes into his battered leather briefcase. When he’s robbed, though, the money turns out to be a red herring. Tucked inside a battered paperback in the bag was the precious last photograph of his son Luke (Jonah Hauer-King), a university student. The photo was taken the night before Luke was killed on board the Pan Am flight to New York that exploded over Lockerbie in 1988. In flashbacks of father and son together, it is wrenching to watch the difference between Tom now and then – a playful, emotionally attuned dad who is clearly dappy about his bright, beautiful boy. The script, adapted by Simon Astaire from his novel, gives flimsier flashbacks to Luke and his American girlfriend, Kate (Stacy Martin), falling in love. These are shot by Huston in a cringeworthy, dreamy style. In the present, Tom looks for his briefcase and makes a kind-of friendship with gorgeous restaurant owner Hannah, played by the astonishing and magnetic Sarita Choudhury, who was Saul’s wife in Homeland and deserves a chunky lead of her own. The film has its emotional moments but sometimes seems as lifeless as a faded old photo. • The Last Photograph is released on 26 April on digital platforms.
Golden Globes crisis deepens as former president expelled and advisers resign	The crisis-plagued Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), the body that organises the Golden Globes, has expelled Philip Berk, its former president who sparked widespread outrage by sharing an anti-Black Lives Matter article that described the movement as a “racist hate group”. In a brief statement, the HFPA said: “Effective immediately, Phil Berk is no longer a member of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.” The HFPA’s move follows outspoken criticism from NBC, the TV network that broadcasts and pays for the Golden Globes, which called for Berk’s expulsion. “NBC strongly condemns Phil Berk’s actions … [and] swift action on this front is an essential element for NBC to move forward with the HFPA and the Golden Globes.” Berk’s removal followed the controversy over his email, reported by the LA Times, in which he forwarded an article by a rightwing website. A number of HFPA members had responded angrily to Berk’s email, with one writing: “The vile rhetoric contained in this screed is simply unacceptable”, and another calling Berk “a thundering disgrace”. However, the HFPA was hit by further problems after it was reported that Dr Shaun Harper, its recently hired diversity and inclusion adviser, had resigned. Harper, the executive director of USC’s Race and Equity Center, had been hired as a consultant by the HFPA after criticism of the lack of diversity among the organisation’s membership. He reportedly resigned after a meeting with representatives of the Time’s Up campaign group, including director-producer Ava DuVernay and producer Shonda Rhimes. The Hollywood Reporter quoted Harper’s resignation letter, which said: “I no longer have confidence in our ability to collaboratively deliver the transformational change that the industry and the people in it whom I deeply respect are demanding of you.” Another of the HFPA’s recently hired consultants, crisis management firm Smith &amp; Company, which is run by celebrated “crisis guru” Judy Smith, has also reportedly departed from its advisory role. The crisis engulfing the HFPA began shortly before the Golden Globes award ceremony in January, when an LA Times report accused the organisation of a lack of diversity in its membership as well as “ethical lapses” in the way it conducted its business.
Cielo review – love letter to the desert’s starry skies	Cielo means “sky” in Spanish, and “heaven”, too. And it’s with a sense of humbled wonder at the immense mystery of it all that the Canadian film-maker Alison McAlpine casts her camera upwards in this beautiful documentary about the night sky. It’s filmed at the stargazing hotspot of Chile’s Atacama desert, where there is virtually no light pollution; the heavens appear to be within touching distance – as if a seam in the sky has been unpicked and the stars tumble out like diamonds. For those of us who live in urban areas, we look up from noisy streets and bright city lights to the vast emptiness of the sky. In Atacama, it’s the reverse; the sky seems more alive than the earth – a bare, Martian landscape of rock and sand. With her cinematographer, Benjamín Echazarreta, McAlpine shoots some astonishing time-lapse photography, which features alongside interviews with astronomers at the European observatories in the desert and locals who eke out a living somehow. One man is a UFO photographer; he thinks that humans are more evil than the aliens and, knowing this, the aliens don’t bother to land. This is a mellow, meandering film and, personally, I would have found a couple of explainers and captions to introduce the stargazers useful. The interviews with the astronomers are terrific; one of them explains that she’s not spiritual, and when she looks into the sky it’s the Earth she’s thinking about, how insignificant we humans are, how tiny in the universe, like ants. A local man movingly explains how his daughter, before she died, pointed to one of Orion’s stars and told him to remember her by it. On the other hand, the score of wind instruments and blippy electronic noises gives it a generic cine-essay feel, and McAlpine’s voiceover of poetic musings doesn’t help. At times this does feel like a bit of an unwitting test of the audience’s attention span. • Cielo is available on 23 April on True Story.
The Seventh Day review – Guy Pearce’s hipster priest dices with the devil	As a Guy Pearce stan, I would happily watch him read a vacuum cleaner instruction manual for two hours. So there was a delicious thrill in discovering he co-stars in this reasonably compelling horror feature as a nattily dressed hipster priest, sporting a plaid coat that looks designed by Gucci. The idea is that Pearce’s character, Father Peter, learned the hard way during the pre-credits sequence just how nasty a business exorcism can be when he was an apprentice in the 1990s (the character played by Chris Galust for the purposes of a flashback) and saw a young boy burnt by the hellish force of evil. Fast forward to the present day, and Peter is assigned to teach a promising young pup fresh out of exorcism school, Father Daniel (Vadhir Derbez, a bit dull but pretty looking) how to handle demons. Their main quarry will be young Charlie (Brady Jenness, impressive), an adolescent boy who messed around with a Ouija board and ended up murdering his entire family with an axe. Poor Charlie is now locked up in an especially filthy-looking jail while he awaits trial, and Peter prods Daniel through the necessary steps he must take to reach the underlying evil that has engineered the situation. To reveal more would spoil the satisfying twist, but suffice it to say writer-director Justin P Lange finds a satisfying way to update the possession-exorcist theme for a new generation grown wary of the Catholic church’s old ways, particularly in the wake of the abuse scandals that have shredded the clergy’s credibility in recent years. In fact, the script might have gone a little further and put a bit more thought into exploring the collision between our expectations from horror as a genre and the real-world horrors inflicted on children accused of being “evil”. But this will do, especially as it’s a chance to watch Pearce and his remarkable cheekbones and gleeful weirdness at work with a scripture-chewing performance that puts a lot of meat on what could have been an off-the-peg turn from a lesser actor. • The Seventh Day is released on 26 April on digital platforms.

Sisters With Transistors review – an electrifying study of musical heroines	Lisa Rovner’s superb documentary pays a deeply deserved, seldom-expressed tribute to the female composers, musicians and inventors from the brief history of electronic music. The focus falls on about nine or 10 women in the field, from experimental music pioneer Clara Rockmore, a Theremin maestro in bias-cut evening dress, through to the British composer and mathematician Delia Derbyshire (probably best known for co-creating the Doctor Who theme), up to Suzanne Ciani, the first woman to score a major Hollywood movie (The Incredible Shrinking Woman in 1981) and her contemporary, composer and early software designer Laurie Spiegel. Each of them entered the field of electronic music from different paths. Unsurprisingly, several started out as classically trained musicians. Others did not: Daphne Oram, for instance, was originally a sound engineer at the BBC before went on to win scientific grants for her research and creating a method of writing on celluloid to score electronic sound. Although Rovner keeps the focus mostly on the women’s work and accomplishments, passing mention of some of the their biographical details points to a remarkable diversity. Pauline Oliveros, a founding member of the influential San Francisco Tape Music Centre, was an out lesbian and Wendy Carlos, who helped develop the Moog synthesiser and won fame for Switched-On Bach, was an early transgender pioneer. Indeed, the film touches on so many characters and ideas it could have been sliced up and rearranged in any number of ways without making gender the connective thematic thread. It could have accentuated the relationship between electronic music and other experimental art forms of the mid-20th century, or the overlap electronic music and technological innovation elsewhere. Rovner’s assiduous, often playful use of archive material points to connections between these musicians and 80s art-school punks such as Thurston Moore and Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth, 50s independent film-makers such as Shirley Clarke, 60s antiwar protestors and 70s Silicon Valley tech pioneers. Not that there’s anything to complain about regarding the woman-artist angle. In fact, a stray remark by contemporary composer Holly Herndon beautifully sums up the feedback loop of visible diversity and why it matters that female pioneers are honoured: “There is something psychological that happens when you can see yourself in the people who are being celebrated.” Surely it will only be a matter of time before someone uses this as inspiration for a biopic project or two, perhaps with Keira Knightley as the compelling Delia Derbyshire. Sisters with Transistors is released on 23 April in virtual cinemas.
Counter Histories: Rock Hill review – landmark segregation protest gets muddled documentary	This 53-minute documentary spotlights an important milestone during the 1960s American civil rights movement that has lost none of its significance. On 31 January 1961, a group of African American students staged a sit-in at a segregated lunch counter at McGrory’s, a store in Rock Hill, South Carolina. In an act of defiance, the young men, who attended the nearby Friendship Junior College, proceeded to order food. Refused service and asked to leave, the men remained until they were arrested for trespassing. What they did after their arrest was even more significant. Out of the 10 students who were arrested, nine refused to post bail and instead served their 30-day sentences. This was the relatively new “jail, no bail” method of resistance. Though enduring hard labour and solitary confinement in jail, the men hoped to lessen the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People’s financial burden of paying bail for protesters. Such a poignant moment in American history deserves to have its story told; and indeed, the interviews with some of the Friendship Nine possess a visceral vividness, immediately transporting viewers back to that fateful January day. However, these powerful anecdotes are sapped by the documentary’s empty and distracting tactics. For instance, for most of its runtime – even when the interviewees are speaking – there is jazz music running constantly in the background, drowning out the stories. Re-enactment scenes simply consist of actors robotically miming events in silence and in slow motion, like a fashion show. Such choices are attempting to evoke the aesthetics of the period, but next to the energy and vigour of the interviewees, these touches come across as thin and hollow, obscuring a dynamic historical episode. Besides the muddled style, there’s also little coherence to the film’s presentation of the events and their context; it does an unfortunate disservice to the story that it tries to honour. • Counter Histories: Rock Hill is released on 26 April on digital platforms.
The Ride review – life lessons on the road to BMX glory	“Another life lesson?” snaps flailing foster kid John (Shane Graham), as his new family attempt to throw him another emotional lifeline. This inspirational drama-cum-antiracist statement, sponsored by the likes of Vans, Etnies and Powell-Peralta, does indeed come over a bit like the action-sports version of the Disney movie but is luckily given just enough emotional ballast by its performers. Graham stars as real-life BMX star John Buultjens – whose story has been transposed from Glasgow to Oakdale, California – who is taken into care at the start of the film aged nine for stabbing his abusive father (played by Buultjens himself). Already being drawn into the orbit of Nazi gangs, with a small swastika forcibly carved into his neck, this white supremacist poppet has to fight for his life in juvie, and grows into a tight-lipped, perpetually vigilant teenager. Then one day his social worker finds him a place in the foster home of mixed-race couple Marianna (Sasha Alexander) and Eldridge Buultjens (Ludacris, on secondment from Fast &amp; Furious ). John’s hostile glances and bigoted quips run right off Eldridge, who gives as good as he gets. “I wanna let you know I packed your lunch myself today – I even threw some crackers in there.” But teaching him to ride a bike is the first inroad towards getting John to expose his vulnerabilities; after he pulls a neat 360 off his school steps, it becomes obvious the kid has talent. Makeshift father and son become closer after John receives an answer to his question, “Why me?” – Eldridge has also come out of institutional care and values a survivor. This core of shared pain, shame and resilience gives vital heft to the tritely relayed antiracist message (as John inevitably runs into his former gang) and to the BMX competition climax, which follows the well-worn berms and jumps of the sports drama. Graham and Ludacris have good, combative chemistry: the youngster, who looks like Michael Shannon, with a face sharpened to an arrowhead; the latter soaking up confrontation with almost amused relish. If the next Fast &amp; Furious spin-off wants to go eco, it could do worse than getting these two to hit the pedals again. • The Ride is available on Sky Cinema from 24 April.
House of Cardin review – genial fashion futurist with an eye for expansion	After a somewhat breathless opening section – yes, we get it, Pierre Cardin was a genius – this genuflecting documentary settles down into a watchable portrait of the late fashion designer that astutely showcases Cardin’s ease in front of the camera (Cardin died in December 2020, after this film was first released). Although there are a string of archive clips featuring Cardin waspishly telling people off or putting them in their place back in the 1960s and 70s, Cardin, in his ninth decade, comes across as a genial, self-deprecating presence, happy to keep on putting projects into the pipeline even though he knows he won’t live to see them realised. We get a concise biographical history: from his Italian childhood to his early years as a tailor for Christian Dior, through to his increasingly otherworldly clothes designs and launchpad to global brand. What comes across most strongly is that, while Cardin may have been a genius when it comes to shape and line, he was certainly a genius when it came to diversification and product licensing, as well as being an early identifier of markets in the US, Russia and south-east Asia. (While showing a bunch of students around his fashion archive, Cardin proudly points to his pleated coat, exclaiming: “200,000 sold in the US!”) This film is very much the authorised version, so not unnaturally we get squads of acolytes and employees lining up to explain exactly how brilliant/groundbreaking/sensitive he is; we also get some moon-eyed celebrity endorsements (Alice Cooper, Sharon Stone), but fortunately also one or two people who really know what they are talking about, in the shape of Philippe Starck and Jean Paul Gaultier. Through it all, Cardin sails serenely: accepting the adoration of the crowd, casually admitting his lifetime’s ambition was actually to be an actor, publicly passing the torch to his great-nephew Rodrigo Basilicati. Compared to, say, Valentino: The Last Emperor (from 2008), this is pretty restrained stuff, but you definitely get a sense of Cardin’s ability to mix artistic steel and commercial savvy. A decent tribute. • House of Cardin is released on 26 April on digital platforms.
Red Moon Tide review – sea spirits haunt the Spanish coast	The strange and striking landscapes of coastal Galicia in northwest Spain are the backdrop to this beguiling landscape film, less a conventional narrative and more a haunting prose piece, tying together ancient superstitions with fears of a coming environmental apocalypse. The central story concerns the disappearance of a local fisherman, Rubio, who believed a sea monster was responsible for the community’s dwindling catch and set out to hunt it down. Rubio is something of a local hero who, we are told, has saved more than 40 people from drowning. In his absence, the town almost literally comes to a standstill. His story is recounted in voiceover by various townsfolk, whom we see standing stock still in the landscape, as if frozen in time. The entire film is told in this fashion. There are no conventional scenes or dialogue, only voiceover and occasional intertitles. Visually it is a series of static or slightly mobile tableaux, often evocative and meticulously composed – somewhere between Andrei Tarkovsky and photographer Andreas Gursky. There are wide, open landscapes, plains, woodlands, mysteriously shaped rocks, moonlit seas (the lunar cycle is implicated in the sea monster’s arrival). There are austere interiors so still the livestock now wander through them. Some of the imagery plays tricks with scale: what appears at first to be water running down a wall turns out to be a vast concrete dam. The soundtrack is full of moaning and wailing and keening of monsters of the deep, and occasionally the squelching footsteps of an invisible walker – presumably the spirit of Rubio. Providing some narrative impetus are three witches who arrive to help look for Rubio. They drape the static townsfolk in white sheets, like ghosts. The trance-like pacing and mystical meditation might frustrate viewers looking for an easy watch, but local film-maker Lois Patiño is clearly operating at the fine-art end of the cinema scale. He applies his distinctive mode to a story that’s both ravishing and unsettling. • Red Moon Tide is available on 20 April on Mubi.
Laddie: The Man Behind the Movies review – Star Wars film boss gets his name up in lights	Here is a highly watchable documentary about Hollywood executive Alan Ladd Jr: an old gold Hollywood profile leavened with top-notes of family strife and reconciliation. Ladd, famously, was the studio boss at 20th Century Fox who got Star Wars through when the corporate brass wanted to pull the plug; but as this film shows, there was quite a lot more to him than that. As his name indicates, Ladd was the son of troubled he-man actor Alan Ladd (This Gun for Hire, Shane) and it’s safe to say they didn’t have the best of relationships: as a gawky teenager, Ladd Jr didn’t fit in with his father’s attempts to project a wholesome family image and can be seen scowling in the background of publicity photos as his younger siblings were pushed front and centre. The film’s director, Ladd Jr’s daughter Amanda Ladd-Jones takes this theme pretty seriously, as well she might; she talks in voiceover about feeling abandoned as a kid by her work-obsessed father, and Ladd himself relates his voracious moviegoing appetite to his isolation. An impressive series of talking heads, including Ron Howard, Mel Brooks and Ridley Scott, line up to shower praise on Ladd – apparently a man of excellent taste, steadfast loyalty, and unfailing modesty. There’s no reason not to take this on trust; in any case his projects speak for themselves. As well as Star Wars he greenlit Alien, Young Frankenstein and The Omen for Fox; later, at MGM, he put through A Fish Called Wanda, Moonstruck and Thelma &amp; Louise. In between studio stints he acted as an independent producer, working on Chariots of Fire, Blade Runner and Braveheart. (He is possibly less proud of starting the Police Academy series.) Ladd-Jones is heartfelt in her desire to communicate her father’s special qualities, as well as outline the sacrifices made (on both sides). An illuminating, affecting piece of work. • Laddie: The Man Behind The Movies is released on 26 April on digital platforms.
Homeward review – a moving modern-day Crimean war story	Mustafa (Akhtem Seitablayev), a grizzled farmer with a profile as unforgiving as an axe head, and his estranged younger son Alim (Remzi Bilyalov) are united in grief. They are flung together by the death of Nazim, the older son and brother, but have little else in common, in this arresting feature debut by Nariman Aliev. But as their journey from Kyiv in Ukraine to their Crimean homeland unfolds, with the shrouded and ripening body of Nazim in the back of the car, the bonds of blood and an embattled shared culture – they are Crimean Tatars – incrementally overcome even the most deeply rooted of personal differences. Aliev is himself a Tatar, and all of his short films to date have dealt with his people and heritage. Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 shone a spotlight on the region, but the roots of this particular story run further and deeper. The taciturn disapproval of the father and the cowed silence of his son result in few opportunities for exposition within the sparse dialogue, but we piece together enough to learn that Mustafa’s family, like nearly 200,000 other Tatars, were deported from Crimea just after the second world war. Once they were allowed to return, Mustafa made it his life’s mission to carve out a place for his sons on the land. It’s beyond his comprehension that they would reject it. Elegant framing makes striking use of a generous widescreen aspect ratio, but the film’s main asset is a deft screenplay that subtly reverses the roles of father and son as the journey progresses. Mustafa’s rigidity is softened by failing health and the realisation that not all encounters are battles – a kite-flying scene has a soul-soaring beauty and simplicity. And after a bonding moment in which his father coaches him in the best way to kill a man, Alim hardens as he shoulders the responsibility for his bloodline. Available on multiple VOD platforms
Sisters With Transistors review – a gloriously geeky music doc	What a joy is a documentary that neither talks down to its audience nor diminishes its subject. Lisa Rovner’s Sisters With Transistors is an unapologetically geeky look at the female pioneers of early electronic music which veers fearlessly into the experimental end of the knob-twiddling spectrum. Laurie Anderson narrates a fascinating film that takes in, among others, theremin virtuoso Clara Rockmore; a beatifically smiling Suzanne Ciani sensually stroking a suitcase full of wires; Éliane Radigue, engrossed in her minimal tonal experiments; and the great Delia Derbyshire, with the mathematical precision of her diction and her demure slingback tapping to a throbbing loop of noise. Particularly glorious is footage of the sound installation artist Maryanne Amacher blasting Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore with pure volume. A mix of fear and exhilaration in his eyes, face quivering in the force of the buffeting sound waves, he looks like a dog putting its head out of a moving car window for the very first time.

Oscars ratings down 58% to new record low	The Oscars telecast suffered another major dip in viewership this year, with early ratings suggesting a 58% drop. The ceremony, which saw on-the-road drama Nomadland pick up the top prize, was watched by 9.85 million Americans, down from 23.6 million in 2020, according to preliminary Nielsen numbers. That year, which was led by a historic win for Parasite, was already the least watched televised ceremony ever for the Academy. It was an unusual evening, heavily affected by the pandemic, with a more modest guest list and venue, with many nominees only appearing via video. It was co-produced by Steven Soderbergh, who decided to make some major and controversial changes with both structure and style. When asked about ratings earlier this month, he expressed indifference. “We’re worrying about things that we can control and that’s not on that list,” he told the Hollywood Reporter. “We’re just making something that we would want to see, that we would think is a good show, because if you’re doing anything other than that, you’re second guessing and you’re lost.” His production scored middling reviews from critics, with Vanity Fair’s Richard Lawson writing that it contained “more languor than pizzaz” and Variety’s Caroline Framke suggesting that “rearranging the metaphorical furniture isn’t the compelling twist that is going to bring them back”. Due to semi-shuttered cinemas, Nomadland, which went directly to Hulu as well as a handful of US screens, is set to be the lowest-grossing best picture winner for decades. A recent survey also showed that audiences were less familiar with the nominees than normal with just 35% of those asked having awareness of Nomadland, for instance. The night’s big acting awards were given to Frances McDormand, Daniel Kaluuya, Youn Yuh-jung and Anthony Hopkins, who wasn’t able to give a winner’s speech. The news follows on from similarly dramatic falls for other pandemic-era award shows. Last year’s Emmys were the lowest ever with a 12% drop, this year’s Golden Globes fell around 60% while the Grammys were down 53% year on year.
Labyrinth of Cinema review – cult Japanese director’s epic blitz of pop-culture hyperactivity	Nobuhiko Ôbayashi is the Japanese film-maker who directed the cult 1977 horror Hausu, or House, and in his long and prolific career also specialised in TV ads starring American movie actors for the domestic market (satirised in Sofia Coppola’s Lost in Translation). Just before his death last year, at the age of 82, he completed this film, his valediction to cinema, to Japan and to life: an epic blitz of pop-culture hyperactivity: baffling, surreal, tragicomic, then simply tragic. At first, it looks as if it is going to be a sentimental lump-in-the-throat elegy to cinema-going’s golden age. But then it takes us to the heart of Japanese darkness: the second world war and the atomic bomb. In the present day, a movie theatre in Onomichi, near Hiroshima, is playing an all-nighter of war movies and three guys in the audience, cinephile Mario (Takuro Atsuki), owlishly bespectacled Shigeru (Yoshihiko Hosoda) and yakuza tough guy Hosuke (Takahito Hosoyamada) are so entranced that they are magically transported through the screen and into the films. There they repeatedly encounter a mysterious little girl called Noriko (Rei Yoshida), a symbol of innocence and hope. Everything but the kitchen sink is thrown into the mix: there are cameos for John Ford and Yasujiro Ozu, there are hints of Kubrick and MGM musicals. There are war-movie sequences that may have been inspired by Fred Zinnemann’s From Here to Eternity or even Richard Lester’s How I Won the War. In the 19th century, there are battles against the Chinese, led by the fierce Lt Sako, played by veteran Japanese star Tadanobu Asano. In the 20th, we see fanatical Japanese soldiers ordering thousands of civilians at Okinawa to commit suicide rather than submit to the Americans. Finally our trio of anti-war anti-heroes encounter a travelling theatre troupe whose casting problems mean that on 6 August 1945 they might have to play an unscheduled show in Hiroshima: the three men desperately sign up as replacement actors to keep them away from this terrible time and place. Their play is The Rickshaw Man – adapted by Hiroshi Inagaki in 1943, and remade in 1958 with screen icon Toshiro Mifune. Labyrinth of Cinema is indeed labyrinthine, a maze of jokes, film references, quirky back projections, bargain-basement effects and melodramatic confrontations. But at its centre is something deeply serious: a belief that, as the sole country to have experienced a nuclear strike, Japan has a terrifying exceptionalism. This awful truth is marked by a tonal cymbal-clash, both acidly comic and desperately sad. • Labyrinth of Cinema is available on 27 April on Mubi.
Anthony Hopkins becomes oldest-ever Oscar winner after taking best actor for The Father	Anthony Hopkins has won the best actor Oscar at the 93rd Academy Awards in Los Angeles. Hopkins, 83, won for his performance as an elderly man with dementia in The Father, directed by French novelist and playwright Florian Zeller, who also wrote the acclaimed stage play on which the film is based. It is Hopkins’ second best actor victory – he won in 1992 for his role as Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs. He had also been nominated for his leading roles in The Remains of the Day and Nixon, as well as for supporting parts in The Two Popes and Amistad. The victory makes Hopkins the oldest ever Oscar winner acting, an honour previously held by the late Christopher Plummer, who was 82 when he won for Beginners in 2011. Hopkins’ win consolidated a late surge of momentum for the actor in this year’s race, following his victory at the Baftas a fortnight ago. The Oscars favourite had been the late Chadwick Boseman for his role in Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom. Also up for this year’s prize were fellow Britons Gary Oldman (for Mank) and Riz Ahmed (The Sound of Metal) as well as the Asian American actor Steven Yuen for Minari. Yuen and Ahmed’s inclusion marked the first time two Asian actors had been shortlisted in the best actor category. Hopkins did not pick up his award in person and the anticipated victory speech delivered in his honour by Olivia Colman in London did not materialise. His award crowned a highly unusual Oscars ceremony, which ended shortly after it was announced. • This article was amended on 26 April 2021. Anthony Hopkins won the best actor Oscar for The Silence of the Lambs in 1992, not 1994 as an earlier version said.
Frances McDormand wins third best actress Oscar for Nomadland	Frances McDormand has won the best actress Oscar for Nomadland at the 93rd Academy Awards, which are taking place in Los Angeles. McDormand plays one of a group of retirees struggling to make ends meet, alongside a cast largely made up of non-professional actors. Written and directed by Chloé Zhao, the film was inspired by Jessica Bruder’s non-fiction book Nomadland: Surviving America in the Twenty-First Century. This is McDormand’s third best actress Oscar: she took the prize for Fargo in 1997 and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri in 2o18. Only Katharine Hepburn, with four, has won more best actress Oscars. McDormand was considered a strong favourite for the award having won best actress at the Baftas, but still had to defeat a strong field, including Viola Davis for Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom and Carey Mulligan in Promising Young Woman. “We should add a karaoke bar,” said McDormand in her speech, delivered shortly after coming off stage to help accept Nomadland’s best picture win. “I have no words. My voice is in my sword. We know the sword is our work and I like work. Thank you for knowing that and thanks for this.” • This article was amended on 28 April 2021 to remove the incorrect statement that McDormand won a Golden Globe for her performance in Nomadland.
Nomadland wins best picture Oscar as Chloé Zhao makes history with best director win	Nomadland has won the best picture Oscar at the 93rd Academy Awards. A study of retirees struggling to make ends meet, Nomadland stars Frances McDormand alongside a group of non-professional actors, and is directed by Chinese-American film-maker Chloé Zhao. The film was inspired by Jessica Bruder’s non-fiction book Nomadland: Surviving America in the Twenty-First Century. Unusually, the best picture award was not the last of the night, being announced before the awards for best actor and best actress. Nomadland defeated strong competition for the Oscar, including The Father, a heart-rending study of dementia starring Anthony Hopkins; Mank, a biopic of Citizen Kane scriptwriter Herman J Mankiewicz; and Promising Young Woman, the rape-revenge comedy drama starring Carey Mulligan. Director Chloé Zhao paid tribute to her film-making team saying: “We thank all the hearts and hands that came together to make this movie,” and thanked the real-life subjects of the film, who also appeared in front of the screen: “Thank you for teaching us the power of resilience and for teaching us what kindness is.” The film’s lead performer, Frances McDormand, also spoke briefly, asking viewers to “please watch out movie on the largest screen possible” as well as the other nominees. She finished by saying: “We give this one to our wolf,” and howled – in what is thought to be a reference to Nomadland’s sound mixer Michael Wolf Snyder who died in March, aged 35. Earlier in the evening, Zhao made history after she became the first female director of colour to win the Oscar for best director, but Nomadland failed to pick up awards for best editing and best cinematography. However, Frances McDormand went on to win the best actress Oscar. The film had previously won a string of accolades, including the Golden Lion at the Venice film festival, best motion picture (drama) at the Golden Globes, and best film at the Baftas. • Chloé Zhao becomes first woman of colour to win best director Oscar • Frances McDormand wins third best actress Oscar for Nomadland
Youn Yuh-jung wins best supporting actress Oscar for Minari	South Korean performer Youn Yuh-jung has won the best supporting actress Oscar for her role in Minari at the 93rd Academy Awards, which are taking place in Los Angeles. In Minari, Youn plays Soon-ja, “grandma” to young David, who comes from Korea to stay with the family on their farm in Arkansas. She brings with her the “minari” seeds that gives the film its title. Youn defeated a strong field including Glenn Close (for Hillbilly Elegy), Olivia Colman (The Father) and Amanda Seyfried (Mank) but she was considered the favourite to win after taking the Screen Actors Guild and Bafta best supporting actress awards. At the latter ceremony Youn memorably thanked “very snobbish” British voters for her prize. Youn was on relatively restrained form at the Oscars, after kicking off by “forgiving” everyone for pronouncing her name incorrectly. She thanked the Academy fulsomely and praising the Minari “family”, particularly the film’s director Lee Isaac Chung. However, she did explain that she “usually just watches the Oscar on television”. “Me being here myself I cannot believe. Let me pull myself together.” She finished her speech by saying she didn’t believe in competition – “How can I win over Glenn Close?” – and said thank you to her “two boys who make me go out and work”. She added: “This is the result because mummy worked so hard!”
My Octopus Teacher, heartwarming nature film, wins best documentary Oscar	My Octopus Teacher, the heartwarming story of a human-octopus friendship, has won the Oscar for best documentary at the 93rd Academy Awards, which are taking place in Los Angeles. Directed by Pippa Ehrlich and James Reed, My Octopus Teacher follows film-maker and diver Craig Foster as he explores an underwater kelp forest near Cape Town, South Africa. Foster appears to bond with an octopus he encounters living in the area. The film has already won a string of festival and critics’ awards, as well as taking both the Bafta and Producers Guild awards for best documentary, making it a firm favourite for the Oscar. However, it had to defeat a strong lineup, including criminal justice system testimony Time, disability documentary Crip Camp, and corruption investigation Collective.
Guardian film Colette wins Oscar for best documentary short 	Colette, a film released by the Guardian, has won the Oscar for best documentary short at the 93rd Academy Awards in Los Angeles. Written and directed by Anthony Giacchino, and produced by Alice Doyard, Annie Small and Aaron Matthews, Colette tells the story of 90-year-old former French resistance member Colette Marin-Catherine, who visits the concentration camp where her brother was murdered during the war with a young history student, Lucie Fouble. Anthony Giacchino, writer and director of Colette, said: “We’re deeply honoured and humbled that Colette has won the Oscar … but our deepest gratitude goes to Colette and Lucie, for allowing us to share their story and bear witness to their journey.” Katharine Viner, editor-in-chief, Guardian News &amp; Media said: “This Academy Award is a real honour and a fantastic achievement for everyone behind this powerful and deeply moving documentary. Colette is the first Guardian documentary to win an Oscar and is a testament to our talented video team who have worked hard to build and grow our distinctive Guardian Documentaries strand over the years. A huge congratulations to all!” Colette’s success follows Oscar recognition for a Guardian film in 2019, when Black Sheep was also nominated for best documentary short. Colette was released by the Guardian in November 2020, the 75th anniversary of the Nuremberg trials. Charlie Phillips, head of video, Guardian News &amp; Media said: “I’m proud that Colette has won the Oscar and am just as delighted to have achieved it with such an important and moving documentary, which helps us to understand history and friendship through two special women.” Lindsay Poulton, Guardian News &amp; Media head of documentaries, added: “What an honour to be recognised with an Academy award! At the Guardian, we are always looking for surprising routes into important stories and Colette’s story of resistance and resilience has moved us all.”
Mia Neal and Jamika Wilson become first black women to win hair and makeup Oscar	Mia Neal and Jamika Wilson became the first black women to win for best hair and make-up at the Oscars, for their work on Netflix’s Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom. “I stand here, as Jamika and I break this glass ceiling, with so much excitement for the future,” said Neal in accepting the award, along with their fellow stylist Sergio Lopez-Rivera. Neal, the department head, and Wilson, Viola Davis’s personal hair stylist, won for their work on the film about one of the few openly lesbian, black performers in America in the 1920s. Neal, who designed Oprah Winfrey’s wigs for 2017’s The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, created 100 wigs for Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom in less than three weeks, based on the fewer than 10 photographs that exist of the legendary “mother of blues”, according to Vogue. “I know that one day it won’t be unusual or groundbreaking, it will just be normal” for black women, trans women, and Latinas to be claiming Oscars, Neal said. The film’s costume designer, Ann Roth, 89, also made history as the oldest woman to win an Oscar, tying Agnés Varda and James Ivory for the oldest winners. While celebrating her work, the presenter Don Cheadle said Roth “reads the script and asks herself questions about the character like: ‘When she goes to bed, where are those clothes? Do they fall on the floor? Does she hang them up?’ From there, Ann builds the costumes which define the character.” Roth did not give a remote speech, and Cheadle accepted on the Academy’s behalf. Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, directed by George C Wolfe, was nominated for five Academy Awards, including best actor for the late Chadwick Boseman.
Chloé Zhao becomes first woman of colour to win best director Oscar 	Chloé Zhao has become the second woman in the history of the Oscars to be named best director at this year’s Academy Awards in Los Angeles. Zhao, 39, consolidated her domination of the category this awards season, following victories at a slew of shows including the Golden Globes and the Baftas, by being named best director for Nomadland, her acclaimed road movie starring Frances McDormand. Born in Beijing, Zhao was educated in the UK and US as a teenager before moving permanently to America for college. Nomadland is her third film, following Songs My Brothers Taught Me (2015) and The Rider (2017). Out later this year will be Eternals, a Marvel superhero movie starring Angelina Jolie and Richard Madden. The prize was presented to her virtually from Seoul by last year’s winner, Parasite’s Bong Joon-ho. Receiving the award in Los Angeles, Zhao thanked the Academy, her fellow nominees, and her entire company on Nomadland. She said she had been thinking a lot recently about ways to keep going when life is hard and remembered a game she played growing up in China with her father, memorising classic poems. One phrase stuck with her in particular, she said: “People at birth are entirely good.” “Those six letters had such a big impact on me,” Zhao continued, “and I still truly believe them even if it might seem the opposite.” “This is for anyone who has the faith and courage to hold on to the goodness in themselves and in each other.

Daniel Kaluuya wins best supporting actor Oscar for Judas and the Black Messiah	Daniel Kaluuya has won the best supporting actor Oscar for his role in Judas and the Black Messiah at the Academy Awards in Los Angeles. Kaluuya, 32, a British actor who rose to international fame after his starring role in Jordan Peele’s Get Out, was favourite for the prize, having won in the same category at a slew of preceding awards, including the Golden Globes and the Baftas. In a wide-ranging, effervescent acceptance speech, Kaluuya started off by thanking God – “I can’t be here without your guidance and protection”, before acknowledging his mother (“you gave me your factory settings”) and offering his praise for the man he played, Fred Hampton: “What a man, how blessed we are that we lived in a lifetime where he existed… When they played divide and conquer, we say unite and ascend.” He added: “Thank you so much for showing me myself, and there’s so much work to do. That’s on everyone in this room. This ain’t no single man job. I look at every single one of you. We’ve got work to do.” Kaluuya closed up by urging everyone to “celebrate life” before pointing out, to embarrassed laughter from his family: “Mum and dad, they had sex. It’s amazing! I’m here!” Directed by Shaka King, Judas and the Black Messiah portrays the betrayal of Black Panthers chair Fred Hampton by FBI informant William O’Neal (played by Get Out co-star Lakeith Stanfield, who was also nominated for this award) in late-1960s Chicago. Kaluuya has also appeared in Widows and Black Panther; his next project is a feature film based on children’s TV show Barney &amp; Friends, which he will also produce. Kaluuya has said the film will “surprise audiences and subvert expectations”.
Another Round, starring Mads Mikkelsen, wins best international feature Oscar	Another Round, the Danish film starring Mads Mikkelsen and directed by Thomas Vinterberg, has won the best international feature Oscar at the 93rd Academy Awards, which are taking place in Los Angeles. In the film, Mikkelsen plays a teacher who tries to combat his depression by following a theory that a high blood-alcohol level results in greater personal happiness. The Guardian’s chief film critic Peter Bradshaw called it “persuasive and watchable” in a three-star review. Another Round is the fourth Danish film to win the best international film Oscar, following Babette’s Feast in 1988, Pelle the Conqueror in 1989, and In a Better World in 2011. Vinterberg’s The Hunt, which also starred Mikkelsen, was nominated in 2014, but did not win. Another Round was up against a strong field, including Romanian political corruption documentary Collective (directed by Alexander Nanau) and Quo Vadis, Aida?, a study of the Srebrenica massacre from Bosnian director Jasmila Žbanić. However, Another Round was always the strong favourite, having been nominated for a Golden Globe and won the Bafta in the same category. “Thanks to the Academy,” said Vinterberg, “this is beyond anything I could ever imagine, but it’s something I have imagined since I was five in train stations, at school, in the toilet and I’m here and it’s amazing.” In an emotional speech, the director thanked his friends, colleagues, family and backers for their bravery “investing in a movie about four depraved white drunk men who teach children to drink”. He concluded by paying tribute to his daughter, Ida, who died shortly after the shoot began aged 19. “We wanted to make a film that celebrates life,” he said, “and four days into shooting the impossible happened. An accident on a highway took my daughter away. Someone looking at their cellphone. We miss her and we love her.” Vinterberg continued by explaining he had received an enthusiastic letter from his daughter two months before shooting when she was in Africa and had just read the script: “She loved this and she felt seen by this.” “We made this to her as her monument. Ida, this is a miracle that just happened and you’re part of this miracle. Maybe you’re pulling some strings somewhere. Anyway, this one is for you.”
Emerald Fennell wins best original screenplay Oscar for Promising Young Woman	Emerald Fennell, director and writer of rape-revenge satire Promising Young Woman, has won the best original screenplay Oscar at the 93rd Academy Awards in Los Angeles. Promising Young Woman is Fennell’s feature debut, and stars Carey Mulligan as a woman attempting to take revenge for the rape of her best friend in college. Fennell was previously best known as an actor, playing Camilla Parker Bowles in the Netflix series The Crown, and working as head writer on the second series of Killing Eve. Fennell was considered a strong favourite for the award, having already won the Bafta and Writers Guild award for best original screenplay. However, she had to overcome a line-up including Aaron Sorkin (The Trial of the Chicago 7) and Lee Isaac Chung (Minari). “He’s so heavy and so cold,” said Fennell as she accepted the Oscar from Regina King. In an emotional speech, Fennell apologised to Oscars producer Steven Soderbergh for not having written a speech, saying the only one she had written was when she was 10 and much of it was no longer relevant. She also thanked leading actor Carey Mulligan, calling her “not only the most talented person in the world but also the kindest and funniest”. She also thanked her family and her young son, who arrived “two weeks after shooting, thank God. I was crossing my legs.”

Another Round set for English-language remake starring Leonardo DiCaprio	Another Round, the Danish comedy-drama about a group of teachers who attempt to survive a term under the influence of alcohol, is set for an English-language remake. Leonardo DiCaprio will take the lead role, played in the original by Mads Mikkelsen. Another Round won the best international feature Oscar on Sunday night, having triumphed in the same category at the Baftas two weeks before. A director or screenwriter for the remake has not yet been confirmed; Vinterberg has said he would not be involved, despite having shot English-language films before, including a Far From the Madding Crowd remake starring Carey Mulligan. “Now it’s in the hands of the finest actor you can get and besides being a brilliant actor, he’s made very intelligent choices throughout his career,” said Vinterberg. “I feel there’s a lot of integrity in the choices he’s made. I’m full of hope and curiosity about what they’re up to.” Recent remakes of award-winning foreign-language films include French buddy movie Intouchables, which became The Upside, and Argentinian thriller The Secret in Their Eyes. A long-gestating remake of German father-daughter comedy Toni Erdmann, originally tipped to lure Jack Nicholson out of retirement, has not yet come to fruition.
Beast Beast review – insultingly shallow take on gun violence	Here’s another indie flick that mistakes handheld camera movements for emotional intimacy. Produced by Alec Baldwin, Danny Madden’s second feature has a host of characters and storylines that are just as empty and unfocused as the migraine-inducing cinematography. Revolving around of group of multi-ethnic Gen Z-ers in the American south, this message-heavy film tries hard to tackle urgent issues such as social media, familial conflicts and, above all, gun violence. The film only succeeds at peddling barely tolerable coming-of-age cliches. The kids in Beast Beast hail from all walks of life. There is Krista (Shirley Chen), a spunky Asian theatre kid who blooms on stage yet wilts at home in the presence of her neglectful parents. She is charmed by Nito (Jose Angeles), a new Latino student from a much rougher side of town with a knack for skateboarding tricks. Looming over their sweet rendezvous is the quietly unsettling presence of Adam (Will Madden), a white firearms “enthusiast” who is obsessed with making gun vlogs. He rarely leaves his parents’ home and prefers stewing over malicious online comments. As the first hour of the film lolls along, full of prickly yet mostly innocent adolescent incidents, but with a sense of malevolence lingering via a recurrent menacing musical interlude full of clanging noises. After all, the Chekhov gun is there and indeed, it unsurprisingly fires to bloody results in the third act. Without giving anything away, the film’s condemnation of gun violence is gratingly shallow, favouring melodramatic histrionics that produce iffy racial optics as brutality is repeatedly inflicted upon the non-white characters. Beast Beast also appears to have done zero research into how a community responds to these kind of tragedies or how the justice system even works. Clearly, the film cares more about checking off liberal talking points than lending its characters any real depth. Such simplistic posturing is, frankly, pretty insulting. • Beast Beast is released on 30 April on digital platforms.
The Bike Thief review – a clear-eyed, unsentimental study of immigrant life	A modern update on Vittorio De Sica’s neorealist classic Bicycle Thieves, Matt Chambers’ feature debut pays the same attention and care to the day-to-day struggles of the urban working class. The refusal to either romanticise or overly dramatise it makes for especially poignant results and the clear-eyed, unsentimental approach renders the characters’ turmoil even more tragic. The film draws viewers in with a kind of urban poetry. The camera closely follows a pizza delivery man on his scooter as he zips through traffic, his figure wrapped in the hues of city lights. The halogen flares, however, quickly turn unforgiving, just like the inhospitable environment engulfing this precarious line of work. Initially seen only as a helmet-covered-face in the crowd, the figure emerges as the deliberately unnamed protagonist, credited only as the Rider (played by God’s Own Country’s Alec Secăreanu). The character’s namelessness places him in a generalised working class, but the film also fleshes out the specifics of Romanian immigrant life in London, beautifully imbued with a wealth of visual details. The vastness of the big city contrasts with the cramped apartment that he shares with his wife Elena (Anamaria Marinca), their teenage daughter and perpetually wailing baby. Though a testament to financial hardship, this space also glows with a familial tenderness that is a refuge from the daily hustle and bustle. However, all of this threatens to fall apart when his scooter is stolen, prompting the mild-mannered Rider to embark on a dark path. Secăreanu is just as intensely memorable here as in God’s Own Country, displaying a deliberate restraint that is even more haunting when it finally cracks. Considering Marinca was such an engaging presence in the Romanian new wave classic 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days, it is a pity that her character isn’t given more to do; perhaps it’s best read as a commentary on the even tougher existence endured by female immigrants. As a result, The Bike Thief is significantly weaker than it might have been, though as a character study it’s still compelling. • The Bike Thief is released on 3 May on digital platforms.
Aviva review – an experimental study of  love, sex and gender	Watch the first 60 seconds of this experimental feature from Israeli-American director Boaz Yakin – it’s a love story with plenty of sex and expressionist dancing – and you’ll get a taste of the bizarreness to come. A naked woman sits on a bed and explains to camera that she’s acting in the film. Her name is Bobbi Jene Smith and she’s a dancer and choreographer by trade, not an actor. But given the dancing required by the script, she says, the film-makers have hired dancers to do the acting. Oh, and she’s playing a man. This is not the last time director Yakin takes a sledgehammer to the fourth wall, and his deeply personal film is deeply exasperating at times, a bit indulgent and at least 20 minutes too long. It’s tells a timeworn tale of a man and woman falling in love only to be confronted with the harsh reality of living together. The woman is Aviva (Zina Zinchenko), a fierce and emotional video artist from Paris. The guy is American, Eden (Tyler Phillips), and their romance begins over email. The scene where the two meet in person is gorgeous: long tracking shots of both dancing through their cities towards each other. The pair’s athleticism and the emotional fluency of their bodies is exhilarating and beautiful. But the film’s big experiment feels only semi-interesting. The roles of Aviva and Eden are also performed by another two actors, a man and a woman (a little nod possibly to Buñuel’s That Obscure Object of Desire). So sometimes Aviva is a balefully sexy guy (Or Schraiber), while Bobbi Jene Smith appears as a female Eden. No one around them seems to notice, and you wonder what Yakin’s film is saying here about gender. When Eden is sulky and withdrawn, his female counterpart arrives on screen to show us his emotionally intuitive side. Maybe I’m reading it wrong, but is the point here that differences between the sexes are hardwired? Or that we each have male and female sides? Either way, it feels reductive. • Aviva is released on 30 April on digital platforms.
Chadwick Boseman’s family defends Anthony Hopkins amid best actor Oscars backlash	The family of Chadwick Boseman, the Black Panther star who had been widely expected to receive a posthumous best actor Oscar for his role in Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, have come to the defence of the man who took the prize. The brother of the actor, who died last August of cancer aged 43, says the family had no hard feelings towards Anthony Hopkins. Speaking to TMZ, Derrick Boseman said his brother would have been the first to wish Hopkins the best following his Sunday night win. The late actor would have seen winning an Oscar as an achievement but never an “obsession” said Boseman, adding that he felt all the shortlisted actors were worthy of the award. The surprise result on Sunday night was compounded by the absence of Hopkins from the telecast and the switch in the running order. Rather than the traditional finish of the award of best picture, best actress and best actor concluded the ceremony, with many suspecting that the producers had anticipated a win for Boseman, which would have concluded the ceremony on a particular note. Instead, there was simply Hopkins’s abrupt and anti-climatic absence to finish the ceremony, its jarring nature compounded by the lack of a host. This year’s Oscars had what had been understood to be a strict “no Zoom” policy that meant nominees needed to either turn up in Los Angeles or in one of the “hubs” – including one at the BFI Southbank in London. Hopkins, who is 83, is currently in Wales and evidently didn’t fancy the trip. It had been thought that his The Father co-star, Olivia Colman, would be permitted to accept the award for him from the London hub. But this is now not believed to be the case, despite Colman having been in attendance, at least for the early part of proceedings, when she was nominated for best supporting actress for the film. Awards pundit Kyle Buchanan suggested earlier today that Hopkins had offered to be on call overnight on video but was refused by the Academy, who also stuck to their protocol of having a presenter accept non-posthumous awards (rather than a co-star) in the event of non-attendance. Hopkins, who posted a video from his late father’s grave earlier on Sunday, posted a video expressing thanks on Monday morning, saying he did not expect to win, and that he was “very grateful to the Academy”. “I want to pay tribute to Chadwick Boseman,” he added, “who was taken from us far too early.”
Identifying Features review – horror and heartbreak in Mexico’s borderlands	There is unbearable heartbreak in this migrant drama from first-time Mexican film-maker Fernanda Valadez – and also a vision of real evil. At times, it looks something like social-realist folk horror. Mercedes Hernández plays Magdalena, a middle-aged woman from Guanajuato in central Mexico whose teenage son Jesús left home three years before, with a friend, on a bus bound for the border, where he’d hoped to take his chances on disappearing into the US as an illegal. But the body of Jesús’s friend has been found on Mexican territory, in an unspeakably grim holding area where the corpses of teen runaways are routinely kept in container boxes awaiting identification – though there is still no proof that Jesús himself is dead. Magdalena sets out on a quest to find her son in the terrifyingly dangerous borderlands where bandits waylay buses for vulnerable passengers who can be robbed, raped, or trafficked. On the way, Magdalena comes across a teenage boy called Miguel (David Illescas) who is making the opposite journey; just deported from the US, he is now miserably trying to find his mother. Of course, the two travel together, and for a while the film appears to be inviting us to predict a bittersweet, figurative ending: that is, Magdalena will “find” Miguel as someone who is very like her son; he will “find” her too in the same way and there will be a crumb of comfort in each other’s company. Identifying Features is indeed about that, but the ending is much darker, more dramatic and sensational with an undertow of spiritual horror: quite unselfconsciously and unapologetically, Valadez invokes the image of Satan. This film (the original title is actually Sin señas particulares, or No Identifying Features) is a cry of rage or a cry for help, on behalf of people in Mexico who have been abandoned to lawlessness, corruption and the vast market forces created by its northern neighbour. • Identifying Features is released on 1 May on BFI Player.
Disney unapologetic over Mulan credit thanking Chinese Communist party 	Disney has claimed it was not responsible for thanking the Chinese Communist party in the credits at the end of the film Mulan, saying the decision was taken by local contractors. In a letter to the Commons business select committee, the film company is unapologetic about its refusal to accept a request to give evidence in person to the committee. Disney also says it was required to comply with Chinese laws at all times. Disney has been widely criticised by British politicians for filming parts of Mulan in Xinjiang province where there are widespread claims, including by the British government, that human rights abuses are being carried out on the Uyghur people by the Chinese Communist party. The letter sent by Sean Bailey, the president of Walt Disney studios motion pictures, says: “Chinese regulations prohibit foreign producers from operating independently and require them to partner with a Chinese production company.” It explains Disney hired Beijing Shadow Times Culture, a private company it said had worked with , “to provide production-related services in China”. Those mentioned in the movie’s credits for thanks include the publicity department of CPC Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Committee and the police bureau in Turpan, an ancient Silk Road city in eastern Xinjiang that has a large Uyghur population. “It is standard practice across the film industry worldwide to acknowledge in a film’s credits the cooperation, approvals and assistance provided by various entities and Disney individuals over the course of a film’s production,” Bailey wrote. “In this case, the production company, Beijing Shadow Times, provided our production team with the list of acknowledgments to be included in the credits for Mulan. The Walt Disney Company has no separate, independent or ongoing relationship with government authorities in the Xinjiang autonomous province.” The filming in Xinjiang only lasted four days, the company added. The company filmed the bulk of Mulan in New Zealand, but for reasons of authenticityused 20 locations throughout China, including the Kumtag Desert in Xinjiang, home to an important passageway along the Silk Road. Disney said: “The decision to film in each of these locations was made by the film’s producers in the interest of authenticity, and was in no way dictated or influenced by state or local Chinese officials.” China has vehemently rejected claims of a genocide as a lie, although the foreign minister Nigel Adams this week said it was a step forward that China admits the detention camps exist.
Letter: Bertrand Tavernier obituary	In 2013 Bertrand Tavernier was the main guest in Dublin at a symposium, John Ford Ireland, celebrating the film-maker. After giving a talk, Tavernier stayed on as a participant. Six years later I invited him to a symposium in London marking the 70th anniversary of Alfred Hitchcock’s return to Britain to make Under Capricorn. He accepted; when work prevented him from attending, he wrote a beautifully judged essay on the film for delegates – typical of a man who, like Martin Scorsese in the US, kept alive the links between present-day cinema and its rich past, to the benefit of both.
Tom Clancy’s Without Remorse review – macho adventure plays by the book	In the last few years, screenwriter Taylor Sheridan brought something steely and smart to the action genre with the drug-cartel thriller Sicario and its politically provocative sequel Sicario 2, a Trumpian nightmare of border-incursion, directed by Stefano Sollima. Sheridan and Sollima are reunited for this movie, but it is a by-the-numbers macho adventure not unlike something from the era of VHS rental, Rambo and tough-guy military mavericks being sold down the river by the pointy-headed creeps in suits back in Washington DC or Langley, home of the CIA. This film is based on Tom Clancy’s 1993 bestseller, originally set during the Vietnam war, but now updated to the situation in Syria. Michael B Jordan is Navy Seal John Clark, whose pregnant wife is murdered on US soil, apparently by FSB agents in revenge for John taking out Russian special forces in Aleppo as part of a hostage rescue. So Without Remorse becomes essentially an unidirectional revenge story, as John is permitted back into the field on a deniable “black ops” payback mission. His friend and ally Karen (Jodie Turner-Smith, from Queen &amp; Slim) has John’s back and secretary of defense Clay (Guy Pearce) rather approves of his heroically unconventional methods – though slippery CIA chief Ritter (Jamie Bell) seems to be running some kind of side-hustle which involves appeasing the Russians. So whose side is this guy on? This is a film that certainly gives you bangs for your buck and establishment stabs in the back – a sine qua non for this kind of story. And with an awful inevitability, John Clark’s ultimate bad guy emerges from the shadows with some outrageous geopolitical monologuing in the approved supervillain style – prior to a post-credits sting setting up a possible superhero-type franchise along the lines author Tom Clancy envisioned. But there’s not much real spark to it. • Tom Clancy’s Without Remorse is released on 30 April on Amazon Prime Video.
Danny. Legend. God. review – Borat-style mockumentary about Bulgarian wideboy	It’s to debut director Yavor Petkov’s credit that, with his coke-hoovering Balkans wideboy Danny, he has created an extremely annoying cinematic character to rival Steven Stifler of American Pie, Jim Carrey’s Cable Guy and Jar Jar Binks. Petkov however, has done it on purpose – and his mockumentary about a hipster film crew following around this smalltown councillor-cum-petty mafioso, played by Dimo Alexiev, blossoms into a deeply uncomfortable viewing experience. The set-up is this: Danny takes Susan (Kate Nichols) and her British crew under his wing to show them around his Bulgarian town. Ostensibly taking part in a documentary on money-laundering, this mean-faced braggart has no shame and operates an access-all-areas policy: they film him berating the local “peasants”, scope out the chocolate factory he’s planning, and watch him bully a bank official. If they didn’t already know they’d snagged a live one, Danny insists they film him receiving a blowjob back at his nightclub. “This is not your project any more,” he raves. “The script is here – in my head!” This act of PR hijacking is mostly plotless, until the disgusted Susan quits, leaving soundman Jaime (James Ryan Babson) – who Danny insists on calling “Junkie” – and the anonymous cameraman to finish whatever it is they’re doing. Petkov starts out in something close to Borat territory, ribbing this arriviste nightmare’s bogus orthodoxy, influencer girlfriends and inability to abuse steroids properly. But Danny is so domineering that he steadily crushes the distance needed for dramatic irony, and the satire transforms into something more hard-faced: a hit job on corruption, and the cult of the neo-capitalist hardman in the former eastern bloc. The film is overlong and paced like a three-day coke jag. And a final point that the naive crew – and by extension, westerners in general – are guilty of wanting to vicariously lap up off-the-chain depictions of exotic locales doesn’t land with the same impact as reflections on spectatorship in the similar Man Bites Dog. It is a bit of a stretch that Danny, no matter what his drug intake, would incriminate himself in front of an international film crew – but the outstanding Alexiev, lurching at the camera with menacing hospitality, sells the character perfectly. Danny. Legend. God. is released on 3 May on digital platforms.
80-year-old review wrecks Citizen Kane’s 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes	An 80-year-old pseudonymous review appears to have wrecked Citizen Kane’s 100% rating on reviews aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes. A Twitter user pointed out the change in Citizen Kane’s rating, due to the addition of a negative review from 1941. It is not clear exactly when the change happened, but website Boing Boing suggested it must have been between 25 February and 15 April, after comparing archived screenshots. The review was originally published in the Chicago Tribune on 7 May 1941, under the headline “‘Citizen Kane’ fails to impress critic as greatest film ever made”, a week after its first release in New York and a day after its Chicago premiere. The writer, credited as Mae Tinee (a play on “matinee”) comments: “It’s interesting. It’s different. In fact, it’s bizarre enough to become a museum piece. But its sacrifice of simplicity to eccentricity robs it of distinction and general entertainment value,” adding: “I only know it gives one the creeps and that I kept wishing they’d let a little sunshine in.” The review implies that Citizen Kane’s status as the greatest movie of all time was already in play before it was released. This was possibly as response to a hostile campaign by its presumed subject, newspaper magnate WR Hearst, to suppress the film and attack Welles after he found out about it in January 1941 via feared gossip columnist Hedda Hopper. It was named best film of all time in Sight and Sound magazine’s decennial critics poll in 1962, retaining the position until 2012 when it was overtaken by Alfred Hitchcock’s Vertigo. Interest in the creative process behind Citizen Kane has been reawakened by the release of Mank, a biopic of its writer Herman J Mankiewicz, directed by David Fincher and starring Gary Oldman. Mank won two Oscars, for cinematography and production design. Reports that Citizen Kane had been “replaced” as the No 1 film by Paddington 2 on Rotten Tomatoes appear to be wide of the mark however. Rotten Tomatoes weighted list places the 1934 comedy It Happened One Night in first place, with Black Panther and Lady Bird in second and third. Paddington 2 is at no 31, but it is the highest placed film with a 100% critics rating.
The Resort review – inane horror film or a sophisticated meta-joke?	Four friends who look like models take a trip to a remote Hawaiian island to check out a shuttered resort where spooky, unnatural things happened years ago. Apparently, the place is haunted by the vengeful ghost of a native girl whose face was mutilated back then. Will anyone survive to write a TripAdvisor review? This inane horror movie is so ludicrously cliche-ridden one starts to wonder if it’s not some kind of sophisticated meta-joke being played on us. How else can we account for choices such as having the whole thing told as a flashback from a hospital bed, by sole survivor Lex (Bianca Haase)? Is it some kind of nudge in the proverbial ribs that, as we see the quartet strip off to swim near a waterfall, we hear Lex intone solemnly that this was the last time they were happy? (Spoiler: because everyone is going to die.) And was writer-director-producer Taylor Chien hoping to use this as a calling card to get a gig making episodes of Love Island? Or did he and his friends just fancy a holiday in Hawaii? Whatever the answers to these and other questions may be, there’s no doubting that this film was more fun to make than it is to watch, although there is a sort of guilty pleasure in the spectacle of ruins and decay and wondering whether the film-makers actually found a real abandoned resort, or if it’s all a set. • The Resort is released on 30 April on digital platforms.
‘Like a Starbucks’: Elton John and Donald Trump deliver damning Oscars verdicts	Elton John was among celebrities expressing his disappointment with this year’s Oscars ceremony, the telecast of which was watched by 58% fewer people than last year. “The Oscar ceremony looks like it’s coming from a Starbucks somewhere,” John remarked to co-host Neil Patrick Harris at his annual – and this year, virtual – viewing party. John was commenting on the new, socially distanced venue at Los Angeles’s Union Station. “I still can’t get over the set,” he added. John later clarified that his chief disappointment was pandemic-related. “I wish we could be there. It’s more fun. This is the only way we could do it.” Meanwhile, Donald Trump issued a statement from Mar-a-Lago decrying this year’s event. “What used to be called the Academy Awards, and now is called the “Oscars” – a far less important and elegant name – had the lowest television ratings in recorded history,” he began. “If they keep with the current ridiculous formula, it will only get worse – if that’s possible.” Trump credited the fall in ratings to “political correctness” and the Hollywood elite silencing Republicans. Late-night chatshow host Jimmy Kimmel mocked both parties on his show, saying: “Trump basically is the Oscars – old, bloated, completely self-involved and obsessed with gold.” He also read out a spoof statement from the Academy, aping Trump’s unusual phrasing and grammar with the postscript “Our show SUCKED this year because you gave everybody Covid.”
Threshold review – road trip out of hell in iPhone horror	In some corner of a US nowheresville town, sad-sack musician-schoolteacher Leo (Joey Millin) gets a call from his mom begging him to pick up his screw-up of a sister Virginia (Madison West). Virginia has had an on-off problem with drugs that ruined a once promising law career. Leo is sceptical of her latest excuse for being found in a squalid apartment looking high, even though there are no obvious track marks: she claims satanic jiggery-pokery has fused her bodily sensations with that of an unknown man, so she feels all his pain and pleasure and vice versa. She has no idea where he is – but carving “where r u?” into her arm prompts a handy reply with precise coordinates. So off Leo and Virginia go, for a family road trip. Most of the running time is spent in close quarters with Leo and Virginia as they reminisce about their childhoods and the ups and downs of their adult lives in mumblecore fashion between bouts of spooky stuff to remind us of the horror-movie reason we here. The jarring shifts in register recall other offbeat, supernatural road movies such as Ben Wheatley’s Kill List, but the direction from collaborators Powell Robinson and Patrick Robert Young is less assured and the performances don’t have the same spontaneity. It doesn’t help that Young’s script is thin on wit, while the sound on the version I saw left much to be desired. That latter problem may have something to do with the fact that the whole thing was shot on iPhones, a gimmick that was charming, cruddy-cool and texturally fascinating when Sean Baker did it with Tangerine in 2015, but which looks dated now and just plain cruddy. • Threshold is available from 3 May on Arrow.
Polanski announces first new film since being expelled from Academy	Roman Polanski has announced his first film to be put into production since the director was expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (Ampas) in 2018. According to Variety, Polanski has secured backing from Italian media giant Rai Cinema for The Palace, a drama Polanski has co-written with fellow Polish film-maker Jerzy Skolimowski. Rai Cinema’s CEO Paolo Del Brocco said that The Palace is set on New Year’s Eve in 1999, and is about “a big hotel immersed in the Swiss Alps where the lives of the guests and those who work for them intersect”. Del Brocco added: “I know that Polanski carries some controversy, but we are interested in the artistic side. The quality of the stories, not the personal story.” Polanski, who is still wanted in the United States after he admitted the statutory rape of a 13-year-old girl in 1977, has become a major target for #MeToo campaigners in France. In 2020 he won a César, France’s equivalent to the Oscars, for best director for his previous film An Officer and a Spy, about the Dreyfus affair, sparking protests and walkouts, including by Portrait of a Lady on Fire’s Adèle Haenel. At the time, Ursula Le Menn, an activist with campaign group Osez le Féminisme, said: “For women who have had the courage to speak out about the abuse they suffered, there is an enormous pain seeing this man distinguished.” Polanski was expelled from Ampas in 2018 “in accordance with the organisation’s standards of conduct”. He subsequently lost a court case that would have forced his reinstatement. Polanski had been arrested in Switzerland in 2009 in relation to the outstanding US warrant against him, but was freed from house arrest 10 months later by the Swiss authorities. Rai Cinema was involved in An Officer and a Spy, which was first announced in 2012, before finally going before cameras in November 2018. Skolimowski was a contemporary of Polanski’s during the Polish “new wave” of the 1960s, co-writing Polanski’s debut feature Knife in the Water. In the 1970s and 80s he made a much-admired trilogy of films in the UK, Deep End, The Shout and Moonlighting. He returned to film-making in Poland with 2008’s Four Nights with Anna.
Safer at Home review – gimmicky pandemic thriller feels very 2020	Of all the awfulnesses rained down on us by coronavirus, down the list in 457th place is the return of the found-footage movie, back on our screens in the guise of the Zoom-call film. Last year’s nifty little chiller Host was a masterclass in how to do it: a subgenre high. Much less satisfying is this gimmicky and derivative pandemic thriller directed by Will Wernick about a drunken virtual party that gets out of hand. There is absolutely no sense of it being shot in real time and a strong whiff of phoniness hangs over the whole thing. Newsreel footage sets the scene. It’s America, summer 2022. After four waves of coronavirus, 31 million Americans are dead, and a nationwide night-time curfew is in place. Stuck at home in Los Angeles on his birthday making do with an online party is Evan (Dan J Johnson). His girlfriend Jen (Jocelyn Hudon) is with him; she’s pregnant but waiting till after the party to break the news. Their friends, joining online, feel like an assemblage of 90s sitcom stereotypes: a cute gay couple, Evan’s party-hard best mate and Jen’s singleton pal. At first, as the friends banter, the interplay between the actors feels a bit unnatural, aggressively upbeat. Then they drop ecstasy pills and the mood turns edgier. There’s an accident – or is it a crime? One of the group runs out into the city with the police in pursuit, and miraculously, while being chased by the cops, keeps his phone steady in his outstretched arm to film himself. The rest of the actors have to make do with staring at their computer screens with insincerely shocked and anxious faces; the lack of dramatic tension is all too apparent. And despite being set next year, Safer at Home already feels out of date. It begins and ends with clips of Donald Trump failing to grasp the severity of virus – and its vision of the US spiralling out of control feels very mid-2020. • Safer at Home is released on 3 May on digital platforms.
The Virtuoso review – Anthony Hopkins on autopilot for dull hitman thriller	This gloomy – literally so – thriller is set mostly over the course of one night, starting out with a big wodge of voiceover narration by the film’s unnamed hitman protagonist (Anson Mount), all of it using the second person voice with a cello sawing away in the background. For a minute your hopes are raised that this will be some kind of playful postmodern narrative, along the lines of Italo Calvino’s If on a Winter’s Night a Traveller, Robert Coover’s Noir, or even a pleasingly lurid Gen X study such as Jay McInerney’s Bright Lights, Big City. Alas, you are disappointed to learn this mystery story is much less clever than it thinks it is. Perhaps you should have twigged that earlier as the hitman, who considers himself a master of his trade, pretty much screws up every assignment he gets after his initial hit, where he shoots a man in flagrante delicto, splattering his partner with blood in the process. When the hitman complains to his boss – Anthony Hopkins (clearly slumming it before winning his second Oscar, and not even trying to fake the American accent required to play a grizzled Vietnam war vet) – about his feelings of guilt and despair about “collateral damage” (ie innocent people getting killed), you rightly suspect this is evidence that he doesn’t have the best judgment. At least, you sigh with resignation, the film had the good sense to give the role of a smalltown waitress to the too seldom cast Abbie Cornish, an actor with great range and subtlety who you hope will have more to do here than pour coffee and look sultry. When it’s all over and the big twist you saw coming in the first 15 minutes has been revealed, you feel empty, a bit depressed, and like you need another cup of coffee. • The Virtuoso is released on 30 April on digital platforms.
Sheep Without a Shepherd review – perky Chinese thriller that toes the line too carefully	It turns out that cinephilia is a productive use of time after all. When his computer is searched, Li Weijie, protagonist of this perky Chinese thriller, has watched 838 films in a year – and he uses his superior knowledge of the seventh art to get his family out of a pickle. Chinese but living in northern Thailand, he scrapes by as an internet technician, but his daughter finds herself at the centre of a murder investigation after she accidentally kills the son of a police chief who was trying to blackmail her with smartphone-filmed rape footage. A remake of the 2013 Malayalam film Drishyam, this big Chinese hit ultimately doffs the cap to Korean cinema: it is Jeong Keun-seob’s 2013 film Montage that inspires Li when he has to provide his family with an alibi. The cat-and-mouse game that ensues is fairly engaging, rooted in two sturdy performances from the main combatants: Xiao Yang’s Li, with his outwardly dopey demeanour but operating with an intelligent pragmatism, and police chief Laoorn, a crack investigator played by Joan Chen with a turbulent confluence of steeliness and maternal anguish. The fine details of Li’s scheme are rather broadly relayed – something not helped by director Sam Quah’s over-eager rhythms. The film cites Hitchcock as the master of tension, and puts commendable effort in to devise similar set pieces. But often the results are a touch forced, as in one scene sparked by a goat noticing Li before the car he is attempting to dispose of sinks into a river. But Sheep Without a Shepherd gets the basics right and, as the town rises in anger in support of the family, it is swept along on a tide of indignation about police corruption and brutality. Given how pertinent a subject this is, it’s a shame about the film’s odd ending, with moralising overtones that make nonsense of Li’s reasons for earlier evading justice. It smacks of Production Code-type censorship and China Film Group, whose production this is, toeing the line on law and order. · Sheep Without a Shepherd is released on 26 April on digital platforms.
The Artist’s Wife review – incomplete portrait of a dysfunctional marriage	“I create the art. She creates the rest of life. Everything we do is up to Claire.” That’s painter Richard Smythson speaking, an artworld big gun, Jackson Pollock-meets-Philip Roth, played by Bruce Dern. He’s being interviewed in front of camera alongside his long-suffering wife Claire (Lena Olin). Her response is frozen on screen for a split second: a forced smile and behind it a flash of panicked terror and possibly rage. It’s a moment of clarity that triggers a late-marriage crisis in Tom Dolby’s tasteful drama, brilliantly acted but never entirely credible and not quite the force for feminism it wants to be. Pretty soon it’s clear what a pile of crock Richard’s comment is. He is a rampant narcissist, and Claire’s entire married life has been in service to his male genius. Years ago they moved from New York to the Hamptons, where she is isolated but he can paint without distraction. When he wakes up in the morning Claire has a coffee waiting for him; she buys his paintbrushes, cooks his dinners and soothes his ego. Dern plays Richard without a shred of vanity, cantankerous and shrivelled, his behaviour becoming more erratic with early dementia. Claire was an artist when she met him and starts to paint again in secret. Her regret crystallises at the opening of a show by an old friend, multimedia artist Ada Risi (Stefanie Powers, slightly overdoing bohemian), a woman who has always lived life on her own terms. Olin portrays Claire’s disappointment compellingly, with intelligence and gentle depth. Which is why it’s maddening that the camera’s gaze seems completely fixated on how phenomenally gorgeous she is. It reminded me of Amy Schumer’s Last Fuckable Day sketch; the point seems to be: “Look, she’s hot! At 66!” Would that happen to a male actor? • The Artist’s Wife is released on 30 April on digital platforms.
Here Are the Young Men review – Anya Taylor-Joy and the bad boys	Here is an ensemble coming-of-ager in which someone actually says the line: “That summer may have changed everything …” It’s in a style I associate with the 90s: movies such as Trainspotting or Human Traffic, with people clubbing and yearning and discovering the value of friendship together as the sun comes up. There’s certainly an impressive cast lineup for this one, but there’s also something weirdly formless and frustrating about it as well; the film gestures at some dark and disturbing possibilities in human nature without quite knowing if or how to follow through. Matthew (Dean-Charles Chapman), Kearney (Finn Cole) and Rez (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) are three Dublin lads who leave school without much idea of what they want to do – not like their super-smart classmate Jen (Anya Taylor-Joy) who has some ambitious life plans figured out and on whom sweet, sensitive Matthew has a massive crush. But then the boys witness something horrible that shakes them up and reveals a sinister side to Kearney, who has a creepy attitude to Jen and a droog-like enthusiasm for torturing homeless people. Kearney is also very excited about his plans to spend some of the summer with his brother in glamorous America, and goes on to tell everyone back home about the limitless sex and drugs. The film periodically gives us highly stylised fantasy sequences showing a nightmarish American TV show, presided over by a gruesome Jerry Springer/Jeremy Kyle hybrid. It’s pretty redundant and obvious satire, and if Kearney really is supposed to be in America, and not just pathetically making it up, then his experiences out there have to be written off as a bit of an off-camera mystery. And Kearney is the unconvincing pretext for the film’s attempt to resolve the proceedings on a sombre, but sentimental note. Some strong performances from Cole, Chapman and Taylor-Joy nonetheless. • Here Are the Young Men is released on 30 April on digital platforms.
Truman & Tennessee: An Intimate Conversation review – reverently unrevealing	A hushed tone of slightly maudlin reverence is the keynote of this well-meaning but somehow pointless dual-bio documentary from Lisa Immordino Vreeland about Tennessee Williams and Truman Capote: the two gay writers from the south who had colossal status in America’s artistic and celebrity circles in the 1950s and 60s when literature was taken very seriously and when homosexuality could be hidden in plain sight as part of the artistic temperament. Much of the archive footage is taken from TV interviews, and this was in an era when writers were honoured guests on talk shows. (Why, indeed, shouldn’t Graham Norton interview Sally Rooney or Jonathan Ross talk to Andrew O’Hagan on today’s TV?) The material, as so often, comes from that unselfconsciously high-minded TV interviewer Dick Cavett, and surely someone has to do a docu-biography of Cavett himself. Capote and Williams were sometimes rivals, sometimes frenemies but probably mostly friends. Yet, frustratingly, the point of this film is not to investigate the nature of that friendship as such: despite the title, there is nothing here equivalent to an “intimate conversation” between them, or that much of a conversation about literature, politics or homophobia. The film simply places Capote and Williams alongside each other as if in a diptych, and where the two are not directly present in archive footage, their words from interviews are spoken by actors: Jim Parsons for Capote and Zachary Quinto for Williams. The parallels continued into the third act. Both men suffered from substance abuse; both also suffered from career decline in the 70s and a gloomy sense of no longer being fashionable, although Capote was not savaged by the critics as Williams was, and managed to maintain a celeb profile through his connection with Andy Warhol. Perhaps Williams never achieved anything comparable to the radical breakthrough of Capote’s In Cold Blood, but, arguably, Capote’s work does not live on as Williams’s does, in theatre revivals all over the world. At the end of this documentary, nothing really original or insightful is really said about either man. • Truman &amp; Tennessee: An Intimate Conversation is available on digital platforms.
Wild Mountain Thyme review – Emily Blunt in an awful Irish stew	There’s a sublime awfulness and condescension to this American vision of Ireland, adapted by writer-director John Patrick Shanley from his Broadway stage hit: a mind-boggling stew of bizarre paddywhackery that makes John Ford’s The Quiet Man look like a documentary about crack dealers. Two of its stars, Emily Blunt and Christopher Walken – both playing Irish people – engage in a colossal intergenerational battle for who can do the worst Irish accent. Blunt and Walken’s brogue-off makes this the King Kong v Godzilla event of inauthentic Irish voices. It’s supposed to be happening in the present day, but it might as well be happening in 1958. Blunt plays Rosemary, a beautiful, sharp-tongued farmer’s daughter in County Westmeath, and isn’t she in love with the soft eejit from the farm next door? The first time we see her, she is actually smoking a pipe, although the presumed “joke” status of that moment is undermined by the keynote of syrupy-poetic whimsy that dominates the rest of the movie. Her beloved is bashful and boyish Anthony, played by Jamie Dornan, who exasperatingly fails to romance her and wears a light macintosh that makes him look like Frank Spencer. Later, shy dreamer Anthony will murmur to the increasingly frustrated Rosemary that he believes himself to be a honeybee. The revelation that he also thinks that she is a flower is the romantic point. But for a while there, he looked like the star of some insidiously subtle psychological horror. But that’s not the least of it. Anthony’s cantankerous old farmer dad Tony (Walken) is threatening to disinherit his son and leave the land instead to his American nephew, played by Jon Hamm, who has a strange yearning to leave the world of Manhattan banking and be an Irish farmer – and the whole film is effectively endorsing and elevating this luxury-tourist daydream to a governing artistic principle. It’s a bit like Nancy Meyer’s The Holiday, and Rosemary is incidentally awarded a Pretty Woman-style moment of sobbing rapture at the ballet. I couldn’t help remembering how Anjelica Huston’s film Agnes Browne was based on the novel The Mammy by Brendan O’Carroll, who went on to develop the same story into the TV comedy Mrs Brown’s Boys. Maybe O’Carroll can take over Blunt’s role for a new show: Rosemary’s Roving Honeybee. • Wild Mountain Thyme is available on digital platforms.
The Mitchells vs the Machines review – a cranky AI gets her revenge	Casting Olivia Colman as the voice of a demonic AI is only the first stroke of genius in this sprightly animated movie, produced by Phil Lord and Chris Miller (The Lego Movie, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse). As Pal, a passive-aggressive Siri-like program installed in everyone’s devices, she’s cranky, imperious and furious about being replaced by an updated model. “Just do what you always do and stare, slack-jawed, at the screen,” she says, witheringly, before her first act of violence: turning off the wifi. Meanwhile, artsy teen Katie Mitchell (Broad City’s Abbi Jacobson) is excited to leave Michigan for California, where she’ll start film school and finally “meet her people”. Her technophobic dad, Rick (Danny McBride), insists the whole family drive her, but the machine apocalypse ignited by Pal proves to be a roadblock along the way. The film retains a warm sense of humour about technology’s grip on society. Even mum Linda (Maya Rudolph) is addicted to her phone, Instagram-stalking the perfect Posey family (voiced by John Legend and Chrissy Teigen). There’s a playfulness, from an avalanche of possessed Furbys (and their oversized leader) to the goofy short films Katie makes (Monchi: Fear Eats the Soul riffs on Fassbinder and features her googly-eyed pug). The animation mixes CGI with 2D drawings scribbled over the images, as though Katie is doodling on the frame. The Mitchells vs the Machines is on Netflix
Pariah Dog review – lyrical portrait of Kolkata’s canine carers	The street dogs that feature in this lyrically-shot documentary aren’t strays, exactly; they are the indigenous, free-ranging “pye dogs” that have colonised India in large numbers and live fundamentally independently from humans. But interaction is not unknown, and this film turns its focus on a disparate set of individuals, all scraping by somehow, who take it on themselves to feed and minister to the animals. The most dramatic figure is the autocratic and argumentative Milly, getting by on dreams of former glory and always ready for a scrap, it seems, with the locals who she suggests are squatting on land she owns. (Part of her rage is directed at her “helper”, Kajal, who she would like to treat as a maid, but has no money to pay her. We also meet Pinaki, an artist who mourns the dead dogs he tried to help, and Subrata – seemingly the most emotional and committed – who walks the streets with bags of dog food, buys a Casio keyboard to play self-composed animal rights songs to a largely uninterested public, and dines out on his appearance on a TV quizshow. The parallel between the animals and their carers is clear – these are all marginal, fringe figures – but never forced by Canadian director Jessie Alk, who spent five years on the project; in fact, the whole thing is put together in a beautifully understated manner, with the human participants allowed to explain themselves on their own terms. There’s a pitiless clarity to the way the Kolkata streets are filmed: intentionally or not, they look like the world’s greatest film set, and the film serves equally well as a portrait of the metropolis. At 77 minutes, this is a brief inspection, but so heartfelt that it never seems too short. • Pariah Dog is available on 30 April on True Story.
Wild Mountain Thyme review – farcical farming romcom	It would be unfair to spoil the twist at the end of this utterly bizarre romantic comedy by US writer-director John Patrick Shanley. Set in a greener-than-green Ireland, it follows Emily Blunt’s Rosemary as she struggles to win the affections of Jamie Dornan’s oblivious neighbouring farmer Anthony. There’s also a land dispute involving Anthony’s ailing father, Tony (Christopher Walken), and his sleazy American cousin (Jon Hamm). Shanley has an Oscar and a Pulitzer (he wrote the sublime Moonstruck, and the stage and screen versions of Doubt). Here, that’s easy to forget, given the cartoon accents and overblown metaphors about horses destined to jump the fence. When it’s eventually revealed why the handsome Anthony remains a bachelor, it’s beyond farce. Yet Dornan delivers the scream-inducing line with total earnestness. His commitment is a commendable feat of comic brilliance, not to be missed. Wild Mountain Thyme is on multiple digital platforms
Identifying Features review – a haunting portrayal of Mexico’s missing people	Mexican film-maker Fernanda Valadez’s piercing feature debut is a sensitive exploration of her country’s missing persons crisis. Some 70,000 people have disappeared in Mexico in the past 15 years, and so Valadez reframes a faceless problem as a series of intersecting human stories. Single mother Magdalena (Mercedes Hernández) is able to identify her missing son’s bag but not his body. Unwilling to pronounce him dead, she searches for him across desolate landscapes, guided by recent deportee Miguel (David Illescas). A sunrise stains a lake pink, a violent flashback is blurry and unsubtitled; Valadez’s expressionist images give texture to the abstract emotions of rage and pain.

Find your true calling with Gwyneth Paltrow | Brief letters	While serving for 38 years as a Methodist minister, I took it as read that it could be described as a “calling”. On retirement, and getting elected to the city council, some people were aghast when I suggested that politics could be seen in the same way.

We Still Say Grace review – religious horror strays from the path of credibility	Nothing else in this schlocky horror-thriller comes anywhere close to matching its cheerfully grotesque opening. Harold, a white-bearded Bible-quoting hellfire fanatic (played by Bruce Davison), is presiding over a last supper; his wife and teenage daughters look terrified. After they’ve finished, he tells them that the wine was poisoned – they should prepare to meet their maker. Except it turns out not to be true. The whole thing is a sick test of the women’s submissiveness to him, their lord and master (though there is nothing godly about the way he squeezes his daughter’s knee). It is the last genuine moment of actual tension in this silly, derivative and wildly unconvincing film. Harold and his family live cut off from the modern world on a farm 30 miles from their closest neighbour. They dress in simple homemade clothes like the Amish and, crucially for the plot, don’t have a phone, a car or even a horse). Harold’s wife Betty (Arianne Zucker) and his eldest daughter Sarah (Rita Volk) are true believers, but the script is thunderingly uncurious about how they might be identifying with him as their abuser. Daughter number two, Maggie (Holly Taylor), reads books so we know she’s going to be trouble. When a trio of young guys knock at the door – their car has broken down – Maggie sees her chance to escape. Harold puts on a show of good-old-fashioned hospitality for their guests, but pretty soon reveals his endless store of wrath for anyone who has strayed from the path of righteousness. Davison plays Harold a bit too genially: there is a likable Jeff Bridges energy to his performance, and not an awful lot of fire in his rants and violent rampaging. In fact, though the movie is played straight, it’s not remotely scary; there might have been more mileage in chucking in a few gags and turning the material into a black comedy spoof. • We Still Say Grace is released on 3 May on digital platforms.
Lucky review – spirited Ghanaian romcom captures the social media age	Here is a vibrant, idiosyncratic portrait of Ghanaian youth, bursting with wisecracks and a boyish restlessness. There is an amateurish shakiness to the visuals, but the film overcomes this with a lot of charm and an innate understanding of its young subjects. University student Lucky (Kumi Obuoabisa) is a loafer who perpetually borrows money from his hardworking mother and enjoys a minor kind of social media fame. His screen – and the film’s screen – lights up with notifications every minute. To his surprise, he secures a date with gorgeous online “it girl” Nuttifafa (Jane Efya Awindor) but with no money to his name, Lucky calls on his friend Wadaada (Solomon Fixon-Owoo Jr), a hustler who prides himself on being able to sell anything. Together the pair try to unload a MacBook laptop, a seemingly uncomplicated task that entangles them with dangerous criminals. These days, films about youth and social media are a dime a dozen but very few of them understand how young people actually talk on such platforms. The strength of Lucky is that it captures perfectly the banality of someone sliding into your DMs and is laugh-out-loud funny in its relatability. In a supporting part, Fixon-Owoo proves to be the real star. Wadaada’s various hustling schemes are amusing, but the character’s frustration with his conservative father lends a real depth to what could have been a caricature. The laddish attitude of Lucky’s leads is jarring and at times uncomfortable; in their world, women seem to be either a nuisance or a prize. Perhaps such portraits are an indictment of young male behaviour in this age of fast-food romance. But given that the scenes are often played for laughs, Lucky crosses the dangerously thin line between satire and simple sexism. Lucky is released on 10 May on digital platforms.
Atlantis review – strangely upbeat exploration of war-ravaged Ukraine	Ukrainian writer-director Valentyn Vasyanovych’s drama won the top prize in the Horizons strand at the Venice film festival in 2019: in the signature style of Slavic arthouse cinema, it mostly comprises a series of long-held, static widescreen tableaux. Each scene is about the same length, and within each long, ventilator-speed shot everything seems to carry the same weight: a man being berated by a supervisor at a steel mill and then jumping into the smelter in despair; another guy making a bathtub out of a rusted out digger bucket; a couple having sex in real time. The story is set in 2025, “a year after the end of the war” – in other words the one with Russia in eastern Ukraine that’s been rumbling away for years now. But instead of being numbingly dreary and depressing, given the economically depressed, horrifically polluted and landmine-strewn region, Atlantis is strangely upbeat, oddly hopeful even. It helps that Vasyanovych, who was also the cinematographer and editor of The Tribe, an outstanding Ukrainian film from 2014, has cast deeply likable and empathic non-professionals, most of whom reportedly had direct experience of the conflict. They reward the director with fine performances. Lushly bearded Serghiy (Andriy Rymaruk) has a gentle, bearish mien and is entirely convincing as a former soldier and former steelworker, who ends up helping former archaeology student and ex-paramedic Katya in the ongoing project of retrieving the anonymous remains of the dead from the fields of battle so that forensic specialists can try to identify the bodies. (She notes with bitter irony that she’s ended up working in the field she studied, only now she’s digging up bodies much less ancient than she expected.) Compared with other recent features set around this region, like Sergey Loznitsa’s antic, surrealist satire Donbass, Atlantis is more conventional and more accessible. But at least it gets to outline some of the horrors of what’s going on there, in a war almost entirely out of sight and mind for viewers in most of the west, and it does so without leaving any acrid taste of hopelessness. • This review was amended on 20 May 2021. The bath was made out of a digger bucket, not a car as stated in an earlier version. • Atlantis is available on 4 May on Mubi.
In Short, Europe: Happy Together review – a union uplifted by humour	In the wake of Brexit, there’s a defiant note in the overarching theme – Happy Together – of this year’s survey of European shorts, brought to us by EUNIC London, an umbrella organisation for EU cultural institutions, and pulled together by London-based curator Shira MacLeod. But, as they say, it’s complicated: the “happiness”, as flaunted in many of these 19 short films, feels somewhat ironic; long-suffering humour the common currency in muddling through a bundle of dissatisfactions, gripes and misunderstandings. In Barnabás Tóth’s Chuchotage, two Hungarian translators make unlikely sweet talk from the Euro-sustainability waffle they have to parse for an attractive client. The scenario walks a fine line next to creepy sexual harassment – before these cunning linguists get their comeuppance. Personal lives thrashing tragicomically in the shadow of the political has been a hallmark of the Romanian new wave, and The Christmas Gift’s hilarious premise suggests director Bogdan Mureşanu could be another future star of that movement. After overhearing his dad badmouth Ceauşescu, a seven-year-old posts a letter to Santa saying his parent’s present should be for “uncle Nick” to die. “He’s no child, we’ve raised a snitch,” yells the panicked father. Meanwhile, Swimmer is a Mexican – or rather Swedish – standoff in a municipal pool as two policemen’s attempt to extract a lawbreaker wrings deadpan magic from piped Muzak, as director Jonatan Etzler floats a cheeky meditation on the boundaries between public and private space. There are more solemn entries: Vanessa Del Campo’s Mars, Oman, shot with photojournalistic rigour, fruitfully collages Bedouin, trainee astronauts and aspiring Arab scientists, while a golden-haired youth freewheels through gentrifying Porto in Leonor Teles’s Dogs Barking at Birds, done with Claire Denis-like suppleness. But the two standouts choose to play things light: the candy-coloured Czech animation Sh_t Happens, by Michaela Mihályi and Dávid Štumpf, is a three-part hard-luck story about a janitor in a building full of animal tenants, which has a Robert Crumb-esque feistiness and punchy sound design. And the hills are alive with hollers, trills and whoops in Hannes Lang’s RIAFN, an initially quaint montage of Tyrolean shepherds’ calls that builds into something as pure and invigorating as a mountain stream. At this altitude, European humour has left daily worries far below. • In Short, Europe is available 7-16 May on digital platforms.
End of Sentence review – a masterclass in understated acting	John Hawkes is one of those actors with a lived-in quality that pulls viewers in before a single line of dialogue is even spoken, and End of a Sentence is yet another testament to the stunning ease with which he slips into his roles. A healing road trip that takes the audience from Alabama to the winding roads of Ireland, Elfar Adalsteins’ directorial debut captures well-trodden paths with fresh eyes. Frank (Hawkes) is a mild-mannered man with a severe exactness to his gestures, the polar opposite of his volatile and impulsive son Sean (Logan Lerman), who has just got out of prison after doing time for car theft. As Frank’s wife has died, the estranged pair are forced to squeeze into a plane, and then a car, as they fulfil her dying wish to have her ashes scattered at a lake in Ireland. Along the way, they pick up Jewel (Sarah Bolger), a hitchhiker with a troubled past, all while attempting to exorcise their shared demons. End of a Sentence is a reminder of how pleasurable it is to see genuinely pitch-perfect acting, the kind that quietly brings characters’ inner lives to the fore. The father-son relationship feels beautifully real, due in part to the precise, economical writing but also to the effortless chemistry between Hawkes and Lerman. Despite her brief screen time, Bolger is arresting and memorable, no easy feat considering that her character feels like a plot device. This writing, along with the occasional on-the-nose song choice and heavy-handed colour correction, lets down a film that is at its best when the camera takes a step back and simply allows the action to unfold. End of Sentence is released on 10 May on digital platforms.
Golden Globes body unveils plans to deal with crisis over diversity and ethics	The Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), the body that organises the Golden Globe awards, has outlined the changes it plans to make in an attempt to rescue its credibility after months of complaints and criticism over the lack of diversity in its membership and “ethical lapses” in the way it conducted its business. In a letter to the organisation’s membership published by Deadline, the HFPA said that it has “created a roadmap for transformational change in our organisation”. The plan calls for the HFPA (which currently has about 90 members) to add a minimum of 20 new members in 2021 “with a specific focus on recruiting Black members”, and over the next 18 months to expand to more than 130, as well as changing many of the requirements (such as residence in southern California) which it claims are “barriers” to “underrepresented groups”. The HFPA also says it will “develop a comprehensive and long-term strategy for the recruitment of racially diverse journalists”. The organisation also addresses criticisms over its perceived ethical issues, after claims that awards voting has been influenced by promotional handouts, members receiving disproportionate financial rewards, and claims of unprofessional behaviour in press conferences. The plan calls for an end to members taking “promotional items”, a “review of press conference procedures” and to “strengthen conflict of interest disclosures”. The HFPA board is threatening to resign en masse if the current membership fails to approve its plans. A positive reception for the HFPA’s proposals from the film and TV industry is vital for the continued existence of its lucrative Golden Globe awards. NBC, the TV network that pays around $60m per year to show the Globes, called it “an encouraging step in the right direction” in a statement to Deadline. It added: “The organisation’s swift adoption and meaningful execution of the plan in its entirety are essential for the Golden Globes to remain on NBC.” However, recent crises show that the HFPA is far from out of the woods. It was forced to expel its former president Philip Berk after he shared an anti-Black Lives Matter article from a far-right website that described the movement as a “racist hate group”; while two of its key hires – diversity and inclusion adviser Shaun Harper and crisis management consultant Judy Smith – departed from their roles. The organisation is also facing a boycott by influential Hollywood PR firms, as well as vocal criticism from the Time’s Up campaign group.
Betrayed review – restrained depiction of Norway’s Holocaust victims	Steven Spielberg once said of Schindler’s List that he was telling a story of the Holocaust, not the story. “There are millions of stories of the Shoah. Six million of them we’ll never hear.” In this heartfelt, restrained movie, Norwegian film-maker Eirik Svensson dramatises the true story of one family of victims from Nazi-occupied Norway. In November 1942, large numbers of Norwegian Jews were rounded up in the middle of the night and taken to a dock in Oslo; 529 were loaded on to a German cargo ship, the SS Donau, and deported to Auschwitz. Jakob Oftebro plays Charles Braude, a good-natured and thoroughly decent young boxing champion who lives in Oslo with his parents and grown-up siblings, all six of them crammed into a two-bedroom apartment. The film begins at the very start of the war, taking great care to paint the Braudes as a close-knit, happy family; it is a little idealised perhaps, but knowing what is to come, incredibly emotional. The Braudes don’t believe the war can touch them in neutral Norway. Then the Germans invade; Charles is arrested and sent to an internment camp with his father and brothers. A Norwegian soldier in the camp, a man with a toad-like smile who makes a big show of being one of the good guys, challenges him to a boxing match, putting Charles in a terrible dilemma – it’s impossible to say no, but to survive he cannot draw attention to himself. The title is an accusation against Norwegians who collaborated with the Nazis; and Betrayed is also at pains to show how some ordinary Norwegians were indifferent to the fate of their Jewish neighbours. It’s a film of desperately upsetting details. Near the end, after the Donau has set sail, large bins full of ID cards stamped with a red “J” are left behind at the dock – no longer needed. And yet there is nothing here that’s too disturbing, no humiliation that’s unwatchably harrowing. It left me wondering what room there is for understatement in a film about the Holocaust, or whether at some point restraint diminishes the true horror. • Betrayed is released on 10 May on digital platforms.
Little Fish review – all-too-brief encounter in the midst of amnesia pandemic	Once you get past its note of emo-mawkishness, there’s something disquieting and poignant (and rather prescient) about this doomed love story of the future, from director Chad Hartigan and taken from a short story by Los Angeles author Aja Gabel. Emma (Olivia Cooke) and Jude (Jack O’Connell) are a young couple living in an America ravaged by a pandemic causing memory loss. The disease has been causing planes to crash, because pilots suddenly forget how to fly, and marathon competitors to keep on running into the night because they’ve forgotten they’re supposed to stop. The couple’s best friends have been hit by the disease, and Emma and Jude are now themselves anxiously monitoring each other for the first signs of forgetfulness, and trying to hoard their romantic memories (so recently made) against the great forthcoming oblivion. Little Fish has obvious echoes of Alfonso Cuarón’s Children of Men and Christopher Nolan’s Memento, though its purpose is to brood more statically on the nature of memory and love. Sometimes it tries the patience, just a little. But it’s a film that is in tune with the Covid age, and it plugs in to one of the great contemporary issues: dementia. The spectacle of young people suffering memory loss is a bold narrative strategy whose effect is to remind you that the old are not a separate, lesser tribe who somehow don’t deserve to avoid dementia: everyone is equal, young and old, and old people feel the agony of dementia as much as young people would (and sometimes do, in early-onset cases). O’Connell – a very good actor of whom I feel I haven’t seen enough recently – is tender and sympathetic as Jude, and Cooke is similarly intelligent and gentle as Emma. • Little Fish is released on 10 May on digital platforms.
Blacks Can’t Swim: The Sequel review – follow-up doc makes a splash	In this feature-length extension of his 2020 documentary A Film Called Blacks Can’t Swim, producer and writer Ed Accura devotes further time pondering the titular myth. It’s immediately clear that it’s a case of don’t, not can’t. But however it has come about, this shibboleth is now responsible for an astonishing statistic: 95% of black adults in the UK and 80% of black children do not swim. As the film points out multiple times, this has life-threatening implications. Lack of parental encouragement, lack of opportunities at school, no role models, braided hair, fear of the deep end and ancestral memories of slave-trade Atlantic drownings are just some of the reasons given in a generous spread of interviews. As well as this fieldwork, the film also has an activist thread in order to combat what Accura calls “blaquaphobia”: dramatised interludes in which he plays Frank, a recent swimming convert trying to convince a pair of reluctant teenagers, K Frost (Reginald Mudenda) and Layla (Amina Smith-Gul), to take part in a gala as part of a programme for disadvantaged young people. The character is based on Accura’s own journey of learning to swim as a 53-year-old. These segments are a little clunky, but hook you in teen-mag photo-story style. K Frost getting suddenly enthusiastic about hitting the leisure centre when Frank bribes them with a meet with a music-video director is particularly amusing. The film’s length and occasional repetitiveness risks the attention-span equivalent of wrinkly fingers, and perhaps breaking out some historical perspective could have been illuminating: recent US research suggests that antebellum African Americans did swim more frequently, and the current stereotypes stem from the rise of white-dominated beach and pool culture. But Accura’s good-humoured approach is a fine ice-breaker for the subject. As one interviewee points out, maybe all black UK swimming needs now is one major cultural advocate. Someone get Stormzy a pair of armbands, pronto. • Blacks Can’t Swim: The Sequel is released on 10 May on digital platforms.
Fried Barry review – alien’s scuzzy body-horror odyssey in Cape Town	This gleefully lurid, picaresque journey through a few days in Cape Town for an alien inhabiting the body of a skeevy junkie named Barry (Gary Green) won’t be everyone’s cup of tea. But scattered among the gross-out scenes – involving violence or bodily fluids or both, the bouts of softcore shagging, and innumerable garish “trippy” bits where the protagonist and his acquaintances do drugs – there’s actually some reasonably sharply comic, surprisingly touching and straight-up well-acted moments. Presumably, the key variables are the improvising performers that first-time director Ryan Kruger, fluffing up what was originally a short into feature length, collaborated with for each scene. Some, like Chanelle de Jager, who plays Barry’s longsuffering wife and is given to long profane rants in Afrikaans about Barry’s uselessness, have real acting chops and bring a palpable humanity to the absurdist setup. Similarly, Sean Cameron Michael and Joe Vaz as psychiatric hospital patients display great comic timing in their bit, and Jonathan Pienaar makes for a terrifyingly sadistic psychopath who performs impromptu dentistry on Barry. Lead actor Green, despite the fact that he apparently worked mostly as a stuntman and had non-speaking roles before this, also has a magnetic screen presence, even though he’s not exactly pretty enough to explain why every woman he meets wants to have sex with him. His improvisational skills are on the same par as the others, but that works just fine given he’s meant to be a broer from another planet. The film’s main failing is that it doesn’t seem to have very much to say about the society in which it’s set. Compared to other Candide-like satires, like O Lucky Man!, Lindsay Anderson’s rollicking adventure through early 1970s Britain, or Rolf de Heer’s marvellously bonkers Bad Boy Bubby from 1993, which romped through another southern hemisphere city in the shape of Adelaide, Fried Barry feels much more like a shaggy dog story without a point: random and meaningless. Or maybe that is the point? • Fried Barry is released on 7 May on Shudder. • This article was amended on 6 May 2021 to correct the name of the actor Jonathan Pienaar.
Steven Soderbergh: Oscars ending changed in case Chadwick Boseman won	Steven Soderbergh, the film-maker who co-produced this year’s Oscars ceremony, has defended the controversial decision to switch round the running order, meaning the final prizes were best actress and best actor, with best film coming third from the end. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Soderbergh credited the decision to the likely narrative of the night, saying that he and fellow producers Stacey Sher and Jesse Collins first discussed the possibility back in January, months before the nominations. “It’s our belief – that I think is not unfounded – that actors’ speeches tend to be more dramatic than producers’ speeches,” said Soderbergh. Back in January, a win for the late actor Chadwick Boseman for his role in Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom also seemed almost certain, with his widow accepting the award on his behalf. This eventuality, said Soderbergh, “would have been such a shattering moment” that “to come back after that would have been just impossible”. Therefore, continued Soderbergh, switching the categories around seemed sensible. “I said if there was even the sliver of a chance that he would win and that his widow would speak, then we were operating under the fact that was the end of the show,” he said. In fact, Boseman lost out on the best actor prize to Anthony Hopkins for his performance in The Father. Hopkins, 83, was in Wales at the time of the ceremony and did not travel to the London hub to pick up his award – at what would have been nearly 4am local time – as the producers had requested. Hopkins’ co-star Olivia Colman, who did attend the London ceremony, was also not allowed to receive it on his behalf. The actor offered to join the ceremony via video link, but the Oscar producers stood firm on their “no Zoom” policy, meaning the show closed abruptly with best actor presenter Joaquin Phoenix accepting the prize for Hopkins and credits quickly rolling. The lack of closure was exacerbated by the lack of a host to wind proceedings up. Asked if he regretted the decision not to allow Hopkins to join by video link, Soderbergh said: “No.” The TV ratings for this year’s Oscars were 58% down on last year.
Cowboys review – Steve Zahn brings his A-game to warm Montana trans drama	There’s a marvellous gentleness and warmth to this Montana-set drama from writer-director Anna Kerrigan. Its star, Steve Zahn, has been a mainstay of Hollywood-indie character acting these 30 years, and he brings his A-game to playing Troy, a roguish, big-hearted guy with a drinking problem, a bipolar disorder and a prison record. He was once married to Sally, played by Jillian Bell, and on the weekends, despite the lack of any court order enforcing it, Sally still lets him see their 10-year-old who absolutely adores him and hates the girly dresses and dolls that Sally keeps supplying and loves instead the Stetsons, denims and huge belt buckles that Troy has. Troy chuckles indulgently at these “tomboy” mannerisms, which triggers this outburst: “Tomboys are just another type of girl – and I’m not a girl.” Their child is not their daughter but rather their transgender son – whose name should be Joe, not the “Josie” they’ve been using. Troy grasps this but Sally can’t, and it’s an outstanding performance from child actor Sasha Knight. This family dynamic comes to a crisis as the fragile relationship between Troy and Sally further disintegrates and, in an increasingly emotional state, Troy effectively kidnaps Joe for a camping trip that, in his muddled, feverish mind, will be their escape up north to Canada, just two cowboys together. For all his problems and inadequacies, Troy – the outsider, the transgressor – is the one who understands Joe, but Bell shows how Sally is understandably angry at how Troy gets to swagger around as the freewheeling male hero and role model while she is gender-stereotyped as the woman landed with the unglamorous job of caregiving. “Look who gets to suck,” she says, asking angrily: “Who would choose to be a girl?” And there is the further issue of how cowboys idolise and fetishise their phallic guns, which are going to get Troy and Joe into deep trouble. Cowboys is a film that relaxes into its ideas and themes, and the performances from Knight, Zahn and Bell – with Ann Dowd as the cop on Troy’s trail – are all tremendous. • Cowboys is released on 7 May on digital platforms.
Sue Hayes obituary	My friend Sue Hayes, who has died of ovarian cancer aged 69, was a talented film and TV consultant, producer and researcher who knew the industry inside out. As head of the London Film Commission (now Film London) she played a major part in making London a film-friendly city. Sue’s forte was making things happen. She was born in London, the eldest child and only daughter of James Hayes, who worked at the Vauxhall car plant at Luton, and his wife, Alice (nee Manuel). She attended Apsley grammar school, Hemel Hempstead, and studied economics and sociology at City University (now City, University of London), graduating in the late 1970s. She took a diploma in industrial relations and politics from the LSE, and went into journalism, working variously for the Daily Mirror, Der Spiegel and the Sunday Times (where we met), as well as working as a researcher for Granada TV and freelancing for Thames Television, London Weekend, and ITN. From 1979 to 1983 she was director of the Edinburgh International TV festival. In 1989 Sue launched her own independent production company, VPL, which made TV documentaries, including For the Sake of the Children (1991), which won an International Emmy. It was the story of a remarkable Manchester woman, Anita Goulden, who visited Peru and decided to stay and care for orphaned children. As a result of the film, a charity was established. The film was commissioned by Granada TV and shown on ITV. Sue also made several episodes of Biography, an American TV series, for A&amp;E networks. It was as head of the London Film Commission (now Film London) between 2000 and 2010 that Sue really came into her own. She relished her role as advocate and promoter of film-makers and filming in the city. Blessed with a wicked wit, she did battle with everyone and anyone who threatened to hinder filming. It was hard to say no to Sue. Sue was kind, fun, and an honest and loyal friend. She was also a mentor and supporter to many young film-makers, and had recently been working for the Location Guide helping film-makers to find sites for filming. She is survived by her husband, the TV producer Rod Caird, whom she met at Granada TV and married in 1995, by their son, Luke, by Sue’s son Charlie, from an earlier relationship, and by two brothers.
Citizen Penn review – Hollywood star’s vanity project lifts Haiti 	Actor, director, screenwriter and now novelist Sean Penn has had some mixed notices for his non-showbiz activities and his dramatic interventions in various international situations – including his defiant declaration of faith in the late Hugo Chávez and his successor as Venezuelan president, the now-notorious Nicolás Maduro. And the naysayers and the eye-rollers may not be entirely mollified by this documentary about Sean Penn’s charity work in Haiti, which does come across in some ways as a 93-minute self-administered high-five. It begins with a carefully curated montage of TV news footage tacitly admitting what a paparazzo-punching brat he once was – but there is no clip of his puppet appearance in Trey Parker and Matt Stone’s comedy Team America: World Police as an archetypal whiny liberal. Well, Sean Penn is entitled to praise. In 2010, he responded to the news about the Haiti earthquake by mobilising contacts already amassed during his experience helping out during Hurricane Katrina, and he got on to Chávez, and asked him to supply hundreds of thousands of vials of Venezuelan morphine for Haiti’s field hospitals. (Penn had been out to Venezuela to meet Chávez the year before in the sceptical company of Christopher Hitchens, who had called him an “oil-rich clown”.) Penn then buccaneeringly headed out to Haiti and virtually commanded his own emergency relief programme, with the aid of the US military and with donations that he was able to secure through self-publicising TV interviews with CNN’s Anderson Cooper. The resulting aid body continued to grow over the next decade, with the aid of Penn’s Geldofian annual fundraising dinners, inevitably featuring concerts by U2; it evolved into a new organisation that trains emergency first-responders in the US and the Caribbean, and also helped with America’s Covid vaccination rollout, a new twist which the movie was able to edit into the closing credits. What the film shows – perhaps not entirely intentionally – is that maybe you need someone vain enough to think he is destined to make a difference, and cunning enough to see how the vanity-economy of movie celebrity can generate media attention and cash. And Penn’s involvement has been a lasting thing. Perhaps the film could have benefited from a more analytical discussion of Haiti’s larger historical context, but it’s a worthwhile record. • Citizen Penn is released on 6 May on Discovery+.
Once Upon a River review – teenager’s waterborne tale of survival	Mark Twain meets Winter’s Bone in this slice of Americana from first-time feature director Haroula Rose. It opens with a Terrence Malick-ish monologue by 15-year-old Margo (Kenadi DelaCerna): “I missed momma, the way she smelled of cocoa butter and white wine.” A tough, resourceful teenager, Margo lives in a rundown town on the banks of the fictional Stark river in Michigan – the kind of place where skeletons of old cars pile up in front yards. Her mom ran out a year earlier (“The river stink drove her crazy”), leaving Margo and her Native American dad Bernard (Tatanka Means). And here the voiceover ends, slightly frustratingly, since Margo rarely speaks, and this is the only time that we get much of a hint of her inner life. She spends her days fishing in the river and hunting deer; she’s a brilliant shot, much better than the boys. But she is also prey. Her cousin eyes her with a feral leer, though in the end it’s her dad’s white half-brother, uncle Cal (Coburn Goss), who lures her into the toolshed. What happens next is not a rape; Rose’s script is insistent throughout that Margo is a survivor not a victim, at the expense perhaps of giving her much in the way of human feelings. There’s a blankness to her character that’s hard to get beyond. The incident in the shed leads to a death. Rifle in hand, Margo takes off in her boat – the River Rose – to find her mother. On the way she relies on the kindness of strangers. There’s a borderline creepy guy who her dad sells deer meat to, a young academic who is impressed by Margo’s survival skills, and, best of all, an emphysemic old-timer called Smoke (John Ashton). For an odyssey about a young woman making her own way in the world, it’s a bit disappointing that all the people who help Margo are men. • Once Upon a River is released on 7 May on digital platforms.
Charlatan review – inside the mind of a prickly mystic 	A local legend in the mid-20th century Czech Republic who scrutinised the urine of his clients and made diagnoses based on a blend of science and mysticism, Jan Mikolášek is a prickly subject for Agnieszka Holland’s latest biographical drama. Its title notwithstanding, the film expends little energy exploring whether or not Mikolášek’s healing gift was genuine. The recurring shots of him glowering at his own hands suggest that it was real, and as much a curse as a blessing. But Mikolášek (Ivan Trojan) does double duty as a character. Not only is he a conflicted man – impatient, impossibly demanding in his work and in his covert gay relationship with his assistant, Frantisek (Juraj Loj) – he also symbolises postwar eastern Europe, torn between political allegiances, progress and superstition, science and folklore. There’s an austere elegance to Holland’s film-making, particularly in the frames within frames that box the permanently peevish Mikolášek into places he would prefer not to be, next to sick people he would prefer not to have to care for. But like the character it explores, Charlatan can seem rather dour at times. A more playful director might have let the amber hues of the ubiquitous pee samples seep into the colour palette, but Holland takes her cues from the greyish complexions of the ailing and the sticky blacks and greens of a gangrenous leg.

Cowboys review – progressive, predictable Montana trans tale	Comic actors Steve Zahn and Jillian Bell are uncharacteristically earnest in this achingly well-intentioned but thuddingly heavy-handed family drama. Zahn plays Troy, the heavily medicated but supportive father of a trans boy, Joe (Sasha Knight, impressive). Bell is Sally, Joe’s mother, who forces Barbies and pink on to her mortified child. In the war zone of Troy and Sally’s relationship, pronouns are wielded like weapons. Even before the repeated shots of Troy chucking back mood stabilisers by the fistful, the unsanctioned father-son road trip into the Montana wilderness seems like a really bad idea. Then Troy loses his tablets and the cops, led by a firm but fair Ann Dowd, close in on the boy and his increasingly erratic father. Plenty of child-with-gun foreshadowing leaves little doubt about how the third act will play out. On Curzon Home Cinema and digital download
Once Upon a River review – a meandering story of survival	A survival story in which a teenage girl, severed by tragedy from her home, goes in search of her estranged mother, Haroula Rose’s debut feature Once Upon a River has a superficial kinship with Debra Granik’s Winter’s Bone. But rather than the sinewy toughness of that picture, this adaptation of the novel by Bonnie Jo Campbell is meandering in its pacing, losing power rather than building it as the story unfolds. Apart from the atmospheric wetland backdrop, the film’s main asset is Kenadi DelaCerna, self-possessed and soulful in the role of the part Native American 15-year-old, Margo Crane.

Servants review – evil permeates a Catholic seminary	As if in a succession of scenes from a starkly remembered bad dream, this deeply disturbing film in haunting monochrome, from director Ivan Ostrochovský and co-writers Rebecca Lenkiewicz and Marek Lescák, tells the story of two students in a Catholic seminary in early-80s Czechoslovakia, part of the (real life) Pacem in Terris organisation, a collaborationist body through which the church submitted to state control in return for the right to (notional) existence. Juraj (Samuel Skyva) and Michal (Samuel Polakovič) are fresh-faced boys who arrive at the seminary to find themselves in an austere haunted house of shame, reeking of paranoia, exhaustion and self-reproach. Dissident young priests are secretly communicating with the Vatican and with Radio Free Europe and the priestly authorities have neither the courage to endorse this defiance nor the ruthlessness to suppress it, and so the secret police are making their malign presence felt – in the form of “Dr Ivan”, who has a blackmailing hold on one of the senior clerics. He is a deeply malevolent man with a skin disorder, played by Vlad Ivanov, another in this actor’s gallery of odious east European authority figures. There are some amazing visual compositions, chiefly some repeated overhead shots of a central basement-level courtyard, accessible via a flight of stone steps, in which washing is hung up and whispered plotting takes place: it is a rectangle of strangeness, like an Escher drawing. And all the time the security police are getting ready to remove undesirable persons, perhaps through the fiction of a military “draft” or through simple murder. Pure evil permeates this brief, 80-minute film, whose cold visual brilliance reminds me of the recent movies of Paweł Pawlikowski. It wasn’t until some time after it had finished that I grasped one of the reasons it was so oppressive: there are no women in it at all. There is a chill of political fear. • Servants is released on 14 May on digital platforms.
A Space in Time review – lyrical portrait of a family facing an incurable disorder	Here is a deeply personal documentary that raises awareness about a disability without neglecting the interiority of those living with the condition. Co-directed by Riccardo Servini and Nick Taussig, the film follows the Taussig family’s experience of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a genetic disorder that affects their young sons, Theo and Oscar. Duchenne is incurable and fatal. By the time Theo and Oscar are in their teens, they will be using wheelchairs full time; their 20s will come with ventilators. Throughout the film, Taussig gently explains these realities to his sons, with no sugarcoating. Satisfying children’s curiosity has never been easy, and here the task is made even more difficult when science itself has yet to provide all answers. The recurring juxtaposition of these conversations with Theo and Oscar playing in the garden or getting dressed for school captures how the condition, while debilitating, is also just one facet of their lives. At one point, the inquisitive Theo asks if ice cream can cure Duchenne. The boys’ experiences are rendered acutely intimate, normalised and without hollow pity. The film also places a poignant emphasis on community and accessibility. Thanks to the goodwill of a building company, the Taussigs’ house is designed to meet the needs of their sons, including wide hallways to provide easy access for their wheelchairs. Interviews with people at different stages of Duchenne and their families illuminate how the condition progresses and also highlight the solidarity among them. Moments of darkness recur throughout the film, the final shot of the Taussigs sitting and laughing on a swing says it all. The future will always be shifting and uncertain, but they, and their community, are all in this together. • A Space in Time is released on 17 May on digital platforms.
Objector review – Israeli anti-occupation documentary wears its politics on its sleeve	In this rousing, unabashedly left-inflected documentary, we meet Atalya Ben Abba, a young Israeli woman staring down the barrel of the mandatory military service everyone in the country must do when they come of age. But Atalya doesn’t want to play any part in the state apparatus that makes the occupation of Palestine possible. Instead, she proclaims herself a conscientious objector, and must face time in prison. While her brother Amitai gets where she’s coming from, others in her family – her mother Alona, sister, father, grandparents – find it harder to understand Atalya’s point of view, especially the members of the older generation who grew up in the shadow of the Holocaust. On the other hand, footage here proves that Zionist extremism permeates every generation: frothy-mouthed young Israeli rightwingers show up at the demonstrations where Atalya speaks only to counterprotest and demand that Atalya and other objectors “go back to Berlin”. Still, Atalya’s story and the testimony of some of her fellow objectors who hope for a political and diplomatic solution to the conflict suggests that the younger generation’s attitudes may be shifting, even if Atalya’s nephew learns about joining the army as early at the first grade. Director Molly Stuart includes interview footage with displaced Palestinians as well as pro-settlement Israelis in order to strike some semblance of balance. But the surging score over montages of Atalya protesting, and others demonstrating their support for her while she’s in military prison makes it pretty clear where our sympathies ought to lie. Strategies like that are legitimate for the purposes of persuasive film-making, but I intensely distrust the use of staged re-enactments in documentaries, like the one in which Atalya argues her case before the Israel Defense Forces’ conscience committee hearing. Even if it’s supposed to be based on a transcript, it just feels disingenuous. • Objector is released on 14 May on True Story.
Born in Flames review – subversive spirit of 80s agitprop lives on	Here is the 1983 zero-budget underground movie from radical feminist director Lizzie Borden (who was born Linda Borden and took the name of the famous “40 whacks” woman) now on rerelease after a recent restoration. One factor that may have kept this film long under the radar is its quite extraordinary climax in which a revolutionary bomb blows up one of New York’s World Trade Center towers – a low-budget but remarkably potent and dreamlike special effect just before the closing credits. And the scene in which this bomb is planted, with someone making her way up to the top floor, creeping through a service door and leaving a suspicious suitcase in a dark empty area full of wires, shows every sign of guerrilla-filming without permission in the place itself. The setting is an alternative-reality New York of the present day (which is to say, the early 80s), 10 years after a peaceful revolution has supposedly introduced a socialist state. But the resulting government, dominated by a single party with frowningly earnest male apparatchiks supervising “workfare” schemes and officially approved feminist theoretical journals, is indistinguishable in its conformism from Reagan’s America; Borden is filming on the real New York streets, also using real news footage of real demos and real police violence. The premise is a rather elegant and sophisticated joke and Born in Flames is comparable to Peter Watkins’s Punishment Park or Godard’s Alphaville. The star is nonprofessional Jeanne Satterfield, a former high-school basketball star who, after this film, became a drug counsellor. She plays Adelaide, a radical “Women’s Army” activist, reclaiming the streets from rapists and the state from patriarchy; she is at odds with the kowtowing collaborationist feminist journalists, two of whom are played by film-maker Pat Murphy (whose feature Maeve is incidentally also rereleased this week) and a young Kathryn Bigelow. Adelaide is mentored by veteran radical Zella Wylie, played by the civil rights advocate Florynce Kennedy. The action culminates in an armed raid on a TV news station, and a young Eric Bogosian plays one of the flabbergasted directors held at gunpoint. The anarchic spirit of agitprop pulses from this scrappy, smart, subversive film. Borden went on to make Working Girls – about sex work – which is also being prepared for rerelease. • Born in Flames is released on 12 May on Mubi.
Undergods review – a visionary dystopian anthology	A riptide of surrealism runs through Chino Moya’s ambitious debut feature, a fantasy suite of tales that don’t so much interlock as butt into one another and blurt out alarming, dreamlike correspondences. Undergods begins with a prologue set in a filthy, post-apocalyptic landscape of Soviet-style tower blocks, being scavenged by Z (Géza Röhrig) and K (Johann Myers). After dumping another corpse in the back of their truck, K confesses to a recurring dream about a pale-faced man – a “ghost” – haunting an empty apartment, “somewhere far, far away from this dump”. This is Ron (Michael Gould), protagonist of the next story, and apparently the only tenant in a high-spec development in the last stages of completion – could it be one of the post-apocalyptic blocks in better days? He and his wife Ruth (Hayley Carmichael) are surprised when a shifty stranger (Ned Dennehy) turns up at their door claiming to have locked himself out of the 11th floor. Ill-advisedly, they make him up a bed. Next stop, with narration by a latecomer in the condo story, is an unspecified mittel-European metropolis where greedy bigwig Hans (Eric Godon) swindles a wild-haired inventor (with a nod to ETA Hoffman’s The Sandman) and pays the price. All these characters are propelled along on surges of Vangelis-like synth, and it is as if the Spanish-born, UK-based Moya is pointing the way – with the ennui and selfish impulses on show in the sub-stories, and the totalitarian-tinged framing narrative – towards some dark, unifying destiny. The last story echoes the first. Rachel (Kate Dickie) and Dominic (Adrian Rawlins) find themselves in an awkward ménage à trois when her ex-husband, whom she prefers, returns from the post-apocalyptic realm after 15 years. Orbiting around dysfunctional domesticity and satirical business environments, Moya has a weakness for parody that sometimes bogs the film down and is in tension with a surrealist wanderlust on the hunt for more startling epiphanies. But the grand visuals – almost constructivist at points – serve both purposes very well, and you’ve got to be heartened by the film’s commitment to originality. • Undergods is released on 17 May in cinemas and on digital platforms.
The Lady in the Portrait review – painterly pageantry in a Chinese royal court	This French-Chinese co-production about an earlier French-Chinese collaboration offers handsome pageantry amid its lavish recreation of 18th-century imperial court life, but it isn’t quite enough to compensate for a puttering narrative motor. Longtime Apichatpong Weerasethakul producer Charles de Meaux has turned director with a far eastern equivalent of Girl With a Pearl Earring – another decorous, ever so slightly sleepy matinee sit. The film’s subject is Jean-Denis Attiret (played by Melvil Poupaud), a real-life French Jesuit missionary who spent half of his 60-odd years employed as the Chinese court painter. His trickiest commission, recalled here, came from the emperor’s bored wife (Fan Bingbing), thirsting to preserve an image that might turn her indifferent husband’s head. Most of the action, such as it is, takes place in Attiret’s makeshift studio, where the central relationship progresses as the painter shifts from tentative charcoal sketches to making marks with ink and acrylic, while various hangers-on debate the differences between Chinese and European art. De Meaux also permits himself the odd expressionistic flourish. A prologue superimposes one of Attiret’s canvasses on an empty battlefield, doubtless saving the director money on armour-clad extras, while his model drifts away to have conversations with the spectres of previous empresses – a very Weerasethakul-like touch, intended to draw out the inner life of a quiet, demure figure. Elsewhere, De Meaux holds dear to the virtues of classical painting. Serving as his own cinematographer, he dabs thoughtful widescreen compositions with appealing pastel hues, aware that – in the drama’s quieter moments – he can always fall back on the ever-absorbing sight of an artist’s hands at work. There are a lot of those moments, though, part of a curious void at the heart of the film, as if the characters were the last elements sketched in, and then in haste. I wondered whether De Meaux’s art-history nous might be better turned to production design or even curation: as it is, the vases adorning the sets demonstrate more character and depth than his pretty yet passive leads. Undeniably artful – but a lot of that beauty is on the inert side. •The Lady in the Portrait is in cinemas on 17 May.
The Swordsman review – thrilling fight scenes in spectacular Korean action drama	The Swordsman, a pacy, crisply choreographed South Korean action film set in the 17th century handicaps itself by opting for such a bland, generic title. It’s like naming a Hollywood action movie The Gunman or The Cop. Debutant writer-director Choi Jae-Hoon could have been a little more specific about the protagonist Tae-yul (played by boy-band-beautiful star and sometime rapper Jang Hyuk) by calling it The Blind Swordsman, given the character’s vision impairment. But then that title has already been used several times. Also, Tae-yul is not quite blind yet, although the threat to his vision and his need to access an expensive medicine hang over the plot throughout. As it happens, the intricate tapestry of action, family drama, political intrigue and period spectacle is anything but generic. Unfolding during a period when ruling dynasties in China and Korea were in major flux, the story springboards off the fall of the Joseon dynasty’s 15th king; a disgrace in combat sends Tae-yul, one of the finest swordsmen in the country, into exile with his baby daughter. Several years later, Tae-yul is living in rural isolation up a mountain; his daughter Tae-ok (Kim Hyun-soo) is now a young woman who longs for the finer things in life. The pair venture into society in search of a cure for his worsening eyesight, only to find that invaders from China’s Qing clan, led by Gurutai (Indonesian actor Joe Taslim, all the more menacing for never speaking above a whisper) are raiding the country, carrying away women to be sex slaves. That only covers a fraction of the plot, but the film never feels bogged down with explication and moves swiftly through its 100 minutes. Then again, if you want simply to absorb this as a balletic dumbshow, interspersed with ace fight scenes and populated by people wearing fantastic costumes, it’s just as satisfying an experience. • The Swordsman is released on 17 May on digital platforms.
The Secrets We Keep review – Noomi Rapace brings light and shade to pulpy drama	Set in the late 1950s in a geographically vague American suburban town where fin-tailed cars roll sedately through the streets and women wear dresses shaped like great silent bells, local doctor Lewis (Chris Messina) and his Romanian-born wife Maja (Noomi Rapace) and their grade-school son Patrick (Jackson Dean Vincent) look like everyone else pursuing the American dream. But as the title rather suggests, there are secrets afoot; quite a few in fact. They all start to come out when Maja spots a tall blond man (Joel Kinnaman, in fact, and, like Rapace, originally from Sweden) with just the faintest German accent. Maja is completely convinced this European, who says he’s a Swiss national named Thomas, is really a German named Carl who did unspeakable things towards the end of the war 15 years earlier. At first, she simply stalks him, wearing perfect little 50s sunglasses all the while. As she does so, the soundtrack plays a pastiche of the sort of suspenseful string music one might hear in an Alfred Hitchcock film from the period, like Vertigo or Rear Window or, as suggested by a cinema marquee Maja and the man happen to pass, North by Northwest. It’s heavy thematic nudges like this which rather tarnish some of the subtlety built up elsewhere in the film, where director Yuval Adler and the cast have performed a narrative fan dance, revealing and obscuring bits of backstory and adopting inscrutable expressions that cast doubt on everyone’s motives and veracity. Rapace is particularly good at seeming mysterious, neurotic, vulnerable and terrifyingly focused all at once when all she’s actually doing is smoking a cigarette and standing there. Messina and Kinnaman offer sturdy support and bring light and shade to their own roles just as well. All in all, it’s an engaging if pulpy drama. It’s the same kind conceit as the Costa-Gavras film Music Box – one that keeps the audience wondering if someone is or isn’t a Nazi throughout – and it is in essence a 50/50 coin flip with only two possible outcomes. But the film keeps the coin spinning through the air for a surprisingly long time. • The Secrets We Keep is available on 14 May on Sky Cinema and Now.
Great White review – hangry shark thriller gets stuck in the shallows	This Australian survival thriller gives us another global warming threat to worry about – hangry sharks. When a great white the size of a 4X4 starts chomping through holidaymakers, marine biologist Charlie (Aaron Jakubenko) is perplexed. Shark season is over – what’s it doing hanging about in Aussie waters? Might it have something to do with rising ocean temperatures, he wonders, or the shrinking fish population? Or maybe it’s the way that director Martin Wilson films human legs dangling so temptingly in the water? This is a killer shark movie with a semi-decent CGI great white, a predictable survival storyline, and all the familiar trappings: the pointed fin gliding menacingly towards dinner, the sea turning red, that creaky lurching sound of a boat bobbing on the ocean, signalling the calm before the attack. Charlie is actually a retired marine biologist, after being bitten by a shark. Now he works with his girlfriend Kat (Katrina Bowden), taking holidaymakers to beauty spots in their little seaplane. Business is sluggish but luckily a last-minute job comes their way, flying rich investment banker Joji (Tim Kano) and his wife Michelle (Kimie Tsukakoshi) to a remote bay. Clunkily, the script sets up tensions that will escalate later. Joji clashes with Benny (Te Kohe Tuhaka), the chef hired to cater the trip; Kat tells Charlie she’s pregnant. From these scenes you can predict the order of the shark’s menu. As soon as the seaplane lands on a beach, the five stumble over shark leftovers, the half-eaten remains of a young man. Foolhardily, they set off to look for his boat and survivors. Needless to say, they find the boat and with it the shark, who makes short shrift of their seaplane. Such is the ravenous appetite of this killing machine, it had me Googling the eating habits and metabolic rate of sharks. You may find yourself nail-biting – out of boredom rather than fear. • Great White is released on 17 May on digital platforms.
Oxygen review – air runs out for claustrophobic survival nightmare	Here is a single-location mystery thriller from first-time feature screenwriter Christie LeBlanc which is more than a bit on the preposterous side. It requires some hefty levels of disbelief suspension and plausibility buy-in. But the excellent Mélanie Laurent (from Quentin Tarantino’s Inglourious Basterds) sells it hard, and it’s a rather elegant contrivance, more restrained than usual from this director, the shlock-horror specialist Alexandre Aja. Laurent plays a woman who wakes up enclosed in a cryogenic hi-tech pod, slightly bigger than a coffin, surrounded by screens and readouts, hooked up to various life-support wires. She can’t remember who she is or why she is there, although she is almost immediately plagued with traumatised flashbacks of being rushed into hospital. Or is she rushing someone else into hospital? She can’t move. She can’t get out. And, increasingly, she can’t breathe. She realises that her oxygen levels will last only around a 100 minutes, the length of the film, in fact, which plays out in real time. And her only friend, the only one who can help her in this claustrophobic nightmare, is the velvety Hal-type voice of the controlling computer, drolly provided by Mathieu Amalric, which in time-honoured style is inscrutable, but with a hint that it knows more and could do more than it is letting on. It’s a high-concept script that reminded me a little of Rodrigo Cortés’s Buried from 2010, which the camera got up close and personal with Ryan Reynolds, who is buried alive – a metaphor for American involvement in Iraq. In some ways, this is a film for the Covid-lockdown era, although claiming its “oxygen” theme as contemporary commentary would not perhaps be in great taste. In some ways, this works better without the metaphorical reading – as just a far-fetched, but quite ingenious entertainment, with some bold climactic touches. • Oxygen is on Netflix.
Some Kind of Heaven review – trouble in retirement paradise	“After my wife passed, I started nightclubbing.” The speaker is a resident of The Villages in Florida, the US’s largest retirement community, home to 130,000 wealthy boomers. The town has more than 50 golf courses and offers endless leisure opportunities, from bellydancing to karate, synchronised swimming to rowing. However, if this documentary is anything to go by, the town’s number-one hobby is dating. Director Lance Oppenheim takes a gentle approach, capturing some hilarious moments, but there’s nothing patronising or mean-spirited about his film. You could make an entire reality TV series about The Villages. Oppenheim keeps it simple with a handful of profiles. Anne and Reggie have been married for 47 years, but since retiring Reggie has been behaving erratically, taking up t’ai chi and hardcore hallucinogenics. Footage of him in court on possession charges is priceless. “When we got married, he wasn’t so unique,” says Anne diplomatically. Barbara from Boston is newly widowed and lonely. Then there is Dennis, an 81-year-old lothario with a leathery tan and a gold necklace. Dennis is not technically a Villages resident – he’s broke and lives in a camper van while trying to hook “a nice looking lady with some money”. Sidling over to a group of women by the pool, he looks like a jaunty, suntanned lizard. Sensibly, most of them give him a wide berth. Dennis used to be a showbiz handyman. “I did some work for President Ford,” he says to a woman who rolls her eyes. Give George Clooney 20 years and you could imagine him playing Dennis. One resident says that the American dream is a happy retirement. Anne is more circumspect. “We live in a bubble. It’s not the real world.” But the documentary was filmed before the pandemic, and in the past year there have been news reports of coronavirus test and vaccine shortages in The Villages. Also in 2020, Donald Trump tweeted a video that went viral of a resident shouting “white power”. The real world has arrived in The Villages. A sequel please. • Some Kind of Heaven is released on 14 May on digital platforms.
Justice League, zombies and Rod Stewart: post your questions for director Zack Snyder	In next Friday’s Guardian, Zack Snyder – one of the most successful and sometimes most polarising directors of the modern age – will be answering questions from friends, peers and Guardian readers. That’s where you come in. What would you ask the man who directed Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga’Hoole and Sucker Punch as well as DC whoppers such as Watchmen, 300, Man of Steel, Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice (he also produced Suicide Squad, Aquaman and Wonder Woman)? Snyder was also the man who quit 2017’s Justice League after the death of his daughter, saw Joss Whedon take it over and deliver a flop that Snyder was advised by his wife and co-producer Christopher Nolan never to see, before a fan lobbying campaign prompted Warner to finish and release the so-called Snyder cut, a four-hour corker that became the unlikely hit of lockdown. This month, Snyder’s belated followup to his debut, Dawn of the Dead (2004), premieres on Netflix. Zombie thriller Army of the Dead stars Dave Bautista as the leader of a gang who aim to clean out a Las Vegas casino vault before the city is nuked on account of the zombie pandemic. An anime TV spin-off is already in the works as is a big-screen prequel. Other future projects may – or may not – include a 300-style actioner about George Washington and an adaptation of Ayn Rand’s The Fountainhead. On top of all that Synder has directed music videos for ZZ Top, Rod Stewart, My Chemical Romance and, er, Morrissey. He is also a substantial fundraiser for suicide prevention and mental health awareness. Earlier this year, he worked with Save the Children to build a huge temporary hospital in Delhi to help fight Covid. We need your questions by the end of the weekend – so get thinking, rewatching and typing! Comments close 11pm BST Sunday 16 May. Army of the Dead is on Netflix from 21 May.
Maya the Bee 3: The Golden Orb review – pants ants antics	As cinemas reopen in England, normal service resumes in the world of little kids’ films. First up for the under-fives is Maya the Bee 3, the latest instalment of the sappy, sentimental franchise from Australia. In the new movie plucky little bee Maya (voiced by Coco Jack Gillies) and her best friend Willi (Benson Jack Anthony) get lumbered with transporting a golden egg to the ant colony at Bonsai Peak. Of course, the egg cracks en route, leaving the pair holding the ant baby – an adorable squidge they nickname Schmoosh. Cue some ant nappy-changing and lessons about responsibility. Weirdly, there is next to nothing specific about bees; with a little tweak here and there in the script, you could substitute bees for chipmunks or dinosaurs. The baby ant, it turns out, is a princess who is destined to become ruler of the colony. But a knucklehead, turbo-charged beetle with a six pack called Bumbulus (Christian Charisiou) tries to kidnap her so that he can run the ants off the mountain. Like the Incredible Hulk of the insect world, he bounces through the undergrowth with his goons. The film is bright and sunny, and the sense of life at ground level is nicely done in places. Everyone in this world is food for another creature; even the beetles cower when a cute little birdie swoops in looking for breakfast. Still, it’s cheap-looking and dismally low on fun. The novelty of being in an actual cinema should sell it to the tinies. Parents will probably find themselves reaching for their phones. • Maya the Bee: The Golden Orb is released in cinemas on 17 May.
Servants review – stylish iron curtain noir	A car parks beneath an underpass; a body is dumped in the middle of the road. The opening scene of director Ivan Ostrochovský’s stylish political thriller, co-written with Rebecca Lenkiewicz and Marek Lescák, plays like a film noir, with its high-contrast monochrome cinematography and empty, rain-slicked streets. The Czech film-maker’s second feature is set in 1980, three decades into then-Czechoslovakia’s communist rule. Teenage students Juraj (Samuel Skyva) and Michal (Samuel Polakovic) swap their sweater vests for cassocks at a seminary, not yet realising that it has been infiltrated by the regime. The dean (Vladimír Strnisko) and his students are watched closely by Doctor Ivan (a menacing Vlad Ivanov), even though the dean is a member of Pacem in Terris, the real-life association of priests who collaborated with the state. Some of the young men quietly rebel, producing pamphlets and contacting the Vatican in secret. The chilling image of a heap of confiscated typewriters – 64 of them – piled in the back of a truck is a potent assertion that personal ethics and independent thought pose a genuine threat to authoritarian rule. Ostrochovský’s camera emphasises the constricting architecture of both church and state, with its black and white morality and a claustrophobic central courtyard, frequently portrayed via stiff, judgmental God’s-eye shots. • On Curzon Home Cinema
Those Who Wish Me Dead review – Jolie smoulders in predictable thriller	Angelina Jolie is almost believable as Hannah, a damaged, foul-mouthed firefighter stationed in a Montana forest, where she must protect 12-year-old Connor (Finn Little), whose father is being pursued by two very efficient hitmen (Aidan Gillen and Nicholas Hoult). Director Taylor Sheridan (Wind River) plays to Jolie’s streak of wildness, but even in smoke-smudged makeup and Carhartt trousers she looks a little too much like a movie star. That’s possibly part of the pleasure of this popcorn movie, which starts strongly as a tense action thriller. Unfortunately, the second half is over-reliant on flashy disaster set pieces, blazing towards a predictable, melodramatic conclusion. • In cinemas from 17 May
Some Kind of Heaven review – a deadpan eye on Florida’s retirees	“You don’t come here to die, you come here to live!” cheers one of the residents of the Villages, in Florida. The postcard-perfect community of some 120,000 old folks has been called Disneyland for retirees, and is the subject of Lance Oppenheim’s spry, occasionally surreal documentary. The film hones in on four idiosyncratic characters: grumpy widow Barbara, recreational drug enthusiast Reggie and his long-suffering wife Anne, and gold-digger Dennis, who lives in his van and works the Villages’ bars and swimming pools hoping to pick up a moneyed mistress. A scene in which Oppenheim gathers a room full of smiling women all called Elaine is straight out of a David Lynch movie. It’d be easy to mistake the director’s deadpan observation for mocking, but the space he holds for the darker aspects of his characters’ individual stories helps to puncture any cultivated cutesyness.

Homewrecker review – suburban hostage caper is a cheerier Misery	It’s a pity this Canadian comedy-horror is too crudely put together to comfortably straddle its two genres, because it contains some zesty bursts of invention and bright performances from its leads. Precious Chong, who co-writes with director Zach Gayne and co-star Alex Essoe, takes one for the team with her unlikable role: belligerently perky fortysomething singleton Linda, who imposes herself on interior designer Michelle (Essoe) while in a coffee shop. Somehow, Linda’s invasive questions about Michelle’s baby-making plans doesn’t stop the latter agreeing to remodel Linda’s house – and heading straight round for a look-see. What starts as a teeth-grating test in how Michelle can politely extricate herself (Linda insists on pre-midday cocktails), turns into a suburban hostage-taking. Chong – with her sociopathic chat, hairpin mood-swerves and neediness – is like a Lycra-clad version of Misery’s Annie Wilkes. But this suspense-free film is not deft enough to turn the dial back and forth, as Rob Reiner’s film did, between scary, absurd and blackly comic. Instead, it plays the abduction 100% bubbly, even during bouts of awkwardly staged violence. If this hobbles the film, Homewrecker is at least adept at devising new torments for Michelle, including one scene in which Linda forces her to play throwback 80s boardgame Party Hunks. This encapsulation of her time-capsuled emotional life leads to reflections on honesty in relationships and life, and there is something endearing about how doggedly Homewreckers pursues this theme. But fundamentally, it never finds a convincing pitch. A tone-deaf musical score that drenches everything – pained comedy, catty exchanges, brawling – in guitar reverb, really doesn’t help. Homewrecker is released online on 24 May.
Death Will Come and Shall Have Your Eyes review – a strangely comforting end	Chilean film-maker José Luis Torres Leiva’s new drama is a thoughtful treatment of terminal illness. It gets under the skin and into the thoughts of two women: a couple, and one of them is dying of cancer. Torres Leiva wrote the script after losing three friends to the illness. His film is anti-sentimental, a tough watch, as they say; the kind that can leave you feeling a little fragile. But it’s sensitive, too, and beautifully acted. Ana (Amparo Noguera) and María (Julieta Figueroa) are in their 40s. The film opens with the two of them in a car. María in the passenger seat gently instructs driver Ana to close her eyes, and for a tense moment Ana drives blind, scared. Afterwards, we discover that María has terminal cancer. What was she doing in that moment in the car? Giving Ana a glimmer of her own terror of the darkness? We watch as the women pack up their apartment in the city and move to a cabin in the forest, where María has chosen to die. Not much is said; the dialogue would probably fit on to a dozen or so typed pages. Torres Leiva is more interested in the emotional weather, the way the two women gaze at each other, or a hand resting on a shoulder. In the bath, María loses her temper with Ana for treating her like a child, and rages at her illness. Two sizable digressions in the middle spoil the film a little. One dramatises a strange fairytale María tells about a naked feral girl living alone in the forest; the other is a family story about her uncle. Both felt a bit generically arthouse, slightly awkward experiments. Overall, it’s a tough watch but in its way gently reassuring. As it can be in life, watching people living with death is strangely comforting – it makes it feel doable somehow. • Death Will Come and Shall Have Your Eyes is available on 19 May on Mubi.
Why Not You review – a hollow depiction of homophobic violence	Here’s yet another film that falls disappointingly flat when the film-makers are more preoccupied with delivering topical messages than outlining nuanced characters. Why Not You tries hard to comment on a mosaic of issues – homophobia, addiction, PTSD, religious extremism – yet ends up hollow and emotionally vapid. The debut feature from Evi Romen, a seasoned film editor, the film’s visual flair sometimes makes up for the jumbled plot, which follows Mario (Thomas Prenn), an aspiring queer dancer at odds with his conservative community in the primarily German-speaking South Tyrol, Italy. With a penchant for wigs and nail polish, he dreams of bigger cities and the personal freedom they promise. Tragedy strikes on a trip to a gay bar in Rome with Lenz (Noah Saavedra), a close friend with whom Mario shares an intense sexual tension. Islamic extremists open fire on the patrons; Lenz dies while Mario survives. Grief, coupled with intense guilt, sends Mario spiralling further into a cycle of addiction until he crosses path with a local Muslim community willing to rehabilitate the self-destructive man. Despite dealing with a host of hot-button subjects, the film has a cavalier approach that borders on distastefulness. In the aftermath of the terrorist attack, the camera glides leisurely around the gay bar, showing lifeless, bloody bodies artistically placed among the destruction. Regardless of how cinematic this looks, aestheticising violence against queer people is morally questionable. The Muslim characters also come off as deeply simplistic: they are either terrorists or benevolent agents, all mere plot points for the white protagonist’s character development. While the shortcomings are numerous, the film does feel authentic in how it captures the landscape and the spirit of the South Tyrol, an environment rarely inspected by cinema. Such attention and care, alas, does not extend to the film’s emotional and political issues. • Why Not You is released on 24 May on digital platforms.
The Dog Who Wouldn’t Be Quiet review – a mini masterwork	Give this movie 73 minutes, and it will give you the world … somebody’s world, anyway. Argentinian film-maker Ana Katz has created an intriguing and beguiling little black-and-white drama that’s punching way above its weight. It’s a series of scenes or vignettes, like a collection of short stories, each about the same person, a little older each time. This is Sebastián, or Sebas, a gentle, laid-back man in his 30s, played by the director’s brother Daniel Katz. Sebas is an intelligent guy, a graphic designer, trained in the use of Adobe Illustrator, but now trying to get temp jobs, made more difficult because he’s not allowed to take his dog into the office, and leaving him at home makes the poor thing howl with misery so much that the neighbours are upset. Sebas gets work as a carer, then with a co-operative group selling vegetables from a truck, then he appears to be podcasting about inequality. He meets a woman at his widowed mum’s second-time-around wedding, and things develop romantically. His life rolls on, or rather, it proceeds in little forward hops. In some scenes he’s got short hair, in some scenes it’s long; sometimes he’s got a beard and sometimes no beard. Each scene is hardly more than a dramatised glimpse, an extended closeup, a fragment of a life – but Katz makes the part stand for the whole with masterly, understated skill. And just when you think this is going to be an essentially parochial tale, Katz takes us into what might be sci-fi, or brilliant prophecy. The fall of a meteor creates a health emergency requiring people to wear astronaut-type respirator helmets if they want to walk upright (the air is not breathable unless you hunch down like Groucho Marx). This film is enigmatic and yet very digestible, deadpan in its comedy and so insouciant and casual in its form, you might almost think that Katz had written it in five minutes, filmed it in a week. There is real artistry here. • The Dog Who Wouldn’t Be Quiet is released on 21 May on Curzon Home Cinema.
Radhe review – Salman Khan blockbuster is a cheap dash through the fight tropes	What was originally scheduled as India’s big Eid blockbuster for May 2020 is opening a year later in cinemas everywhere but India itself, where it came out on streaming platforms last weekend. In his guise as producer-megastar, musclebound Salman Khan has dispatched his minions to hollow out the taut narrative chicanery of 2017’s Korean thriller The Outlaws and reconfigure its carcass into the kind of flattering vehicle only a powerful Bollywood leading man can command. Despite some early welcome flickers of the kind of self-awareness that’s crept into Khan’s projects over the past half-decade, the result is very much back-to-basics. The more knowing nonsense only serves to make the eventual slump into third-rate pummelling more dispiriting. Most of that nonsense, which prompts fitful back-row giggles, concerns Khan’s indomitable hero cop Radhe. “He has his own methods of working,” insists one of the Mumbai police chiefs recruiting him to protect the city’s youth from straggle-haired druglord Randeep Hooda. These include: never entering via the door when he can leap face-first through a glass window, manifesting in multiple locations simultaneously so as to better box his quarries’ ears, and – less amusingly – casually torturing suspects. A chance encounter with poster-girl Diya (Disha Patani) encourages our man to try male modelling; this love interest, naturally, turns out to be the sister of Radhe’s ever more exasperated CO (Jackie Shroff). Don’t ask about the 35-year age gap between these siblings; no one behind the camera clearly bothered. While a jocular, self-mocking Khan is still preferable to the puppy-eyed sentimentalist who made 2017’s Tubelight and 2019’s Bharat such ordeals, there’s an awful lot of self to mock here, and not nearly enough craft to counterbalance that ego. Hired to glam up an expensive-looking nightclub number, guest star Jacqueline Fernandez gets elbowed out of sight once Radhe storms the stage to prat around. Quality control gets shoved off soon after. One bathroom punch-up is shot on such cheap, smeary digital it resembles rehearsal footage. Even the fun stuff is low-grade and limited, because our guy’s heroism is forever meant to be taken as sacrosanct. Director Prabhu Deva’s cursory dash through the not-so-grand finale suggests he clearly wanted it over; you may do, too. • Radhe is released in the UK on 17 May in cinemas.
Redoubt review – Matthew Barney’s mysterious, mythical movie-ballet	Redoubt is a wordless outdoor movie-ballet inspired by the huntress myth of Diana, set in the forested wilderness of Idaho’s Sawtooth mountains and brought to us by artist and film-maker Matthew Barney, whose most famous work is probably his colossal five-film sequence, the Cremaster Cycle. Cremaster was a headspinningly gigantic folie de grandeur spanning six hours in total, inspired by the interrelation of biology and creativity. Redoubt is a more modest two-and-a-quarter hours, part of an art installation including sculptures and engravings, originally commissioned by Yale University. Barney plays a hardy outdoorsman, an engraver who hikes around the wilderness, making etchings on an engraving plate; his redoubt appears to be a modest trailer which he shares with a woman (KJ Holmes), perhaps his wife or partner, who electroplates the resulting work in a chemical bath. But the engraver is in a mysterious state of antagonism, or at least wary coexistence, with three women in the forest who are hunting wolves: Diana (played by real-life sharpshooter and NRA member Anette Wachter), and her “Calling Virgin” and “Tracking Virgin” (played by the dancers Eleanor Bauer and Laura Stokes) who are dressed in camo, carry serious rifles and hardware; the Virgins go into strange, showy dance moves in the snow (which, it has to be said, rather negates the importance of camouflage and not revealing yourself to the prey). Wolves and other animals get shot, though a final note on the credits assures us that this is just an effect. Could it be that the engraver himself is destined, like Actaeon in the myth, to be the prey? It is a handsome-looking film, with a strange and compelling soundtrack by Jonathan Bepler. Redoubt is about humanity’s relationship with nature and the business of hunting itself (and the presence of gun enthusiast Wachter implies that the film can’t be interpreted as straightforwardly opposed to hunting). I wondered how much really was being said, in the end, but Barney has a bold and distinctive style. • Redoubt is released on 20 May on Mubi, and is also screening on 19 May-25 July at Matthew Barney: Redoubt at the Hayward Gallery, London.
The Auschwitz Escape review – death camp’s secrets uncovered in powerful drama	In 1944, two Jewish Slovaks, Rudolf Vrba (Peter Ondrejička) and Alfred Wetzler (Noel Czuczor), both of them prisoners at Auschwitz-Birkenau, hide in some wooden pallets and wait for a moment to escape. Carrying documents that will prove what is really happening in the extermination camp, they manage to make it through the fence and into the forest, an escape that precious few managed. Meanwhile, those who stayed behind, some of whom risked their lives to help Vrba and Wetzler escape, are cruelly punished by the camp guards. This dramatised account of a true story plays like a grim high-stakes thriller as we root for the two men to make it over the border. Their names may be unfamiliar, but even for those who know about the Auschwitz Protocols – a report to which the pair contributed that has a weighty legacy in Holocaust history – the film is still intensely impactful. Inevitably, it is profoundly upsetting and disturbing. Nevertheless, Slovak director Peter Bebjack has managed to make a film that relates this chapter of history in a new way, employing inventive cinematic techniques to present the material. For instance, Bebjak and cinematographer Martin Ziaran often film the action with an upside-down camera, thus mimicking the point of view of the protagonists. The colours are all bleached out to a near monochrome palette, soggy and grey as the Polish mud. Elsewhere, flashbacks and dreams intermingle to keep you always a little off balance. Long takes track slowly through scenes of horror, and a few sequences take place in a darkened room where hundreds of naked corpses are stacked up like lumber. It is particularly upsetting that this last setting is barely noticed by the characters as they go about their business, as if they see this sort of thing every day. The acting is extraordinary throughout, especially from the two leads, and John Hannah offers a beautifully underplayed cameo as a Red Cross employee who almost can’t believe his ears towards the end of the film. • The Auschwitz Escape is released on 14 May on digital platforms.
The 8th review – the stirring story behind Ireland’s pro-choice triumph	Two years after the UK’s remainer liberals lost the EU referendum, Irish campaigners fighting to repeal the constitution’s eighth amendment forbidding abortion showed them how you win this kind of vote: with real passion, real vision and real determination not to take anything for granted. In 2018, Ireland’s pro-choice voters won the referendum handsomely – 66% on a 64% turnout – an inspiring story told in this spirited documentary by Aideen Kane, Lucy Kennedy and Maeve O’Boyle. So many of Ireland’s women, particularly its young women, were infuriated by the years of being told that their experiences, their health and their safety were quite irrelevant compared with those scruples declaimed by thin-lipped reactionaries of church and state. What galvanised the campaign was the horrific story of Savita Halappanavar, the Indian woman who in 2012 died in University Hospital Galway after a septic miscarriage because a termination was not permitted; the pure shame of that event energised the movement. The abortion issue is unique, in secular political terms, for the absolute impossibility of dialogue between the two sides, and in fact the pro-choice activists in this film conform to their side’s traditional unwillingness to spell out their baseline beliefs: the foetus does not become fully eligible for human rights until it is a separate entity and has left the mother’s body. Anti-abortionists believe, on the contrary, that this happens on conception, in the womb. It is a fundamentalist belief that in Ireland has traditionally won the day. But pro-choice women were sick of being lectured and sorrowingly told they were the useful idiots of evil – particularly as this political stance came as part and parcel of a general contempt for women’s rights, of which the Magdalene laundries scandal was another grisly part. Pro-choice activists won with a campaign that declined to go negative, and, indeed, may have benefited from the attraction of its exuberant “Yes” motif. Now they face decades of vigilance to defend their gains. The 8th is released on 25 May in cinemas and on digital platforms.
Peter Rabbit 2 tops box office as UK’s reopened cinemas take £2m in three days	A strong summer at the UK cinema looks like an increasingly realistic prospect following three impressive days at the box office. Cinemas were permitted to open their doors at 50% capacity on Monday, and film-lovers eager for a fix – or appalled by the weather – showed little hesitancy following seven months of smaller screens. Wednesday’s total was estimated to be around £760,000, up 41% from Tuesday, in part because of 120 Cineworld sites reopening that day, having remained closed on Monday and Tuesday. The three-day total is around £2.8m. Topping the chart is Peter Rabbit 2, the sequel to the 2018 hit, whose release has been long delayed because of the pandemic. Other healthy performers include Nomadland and Godzilla vs Kong, with audiences opting to see them on the big screen despite their availability on streaming platforms. Spiral: From the Book of Saw and The Unholy are also in the Top 5, with the bottom of the Top 10 entirely dominated by Warner Bros titles: Mortal Kombat, Judas and the Black Messiah, Those Who Wish Me Dead, Tom &amp; Jerry and The Little Things. This Friday’s releases include Billie Piper’s anti romcom Rare Beasts, with Disney hoping to woo the half term crowd the following Friday with Cruella, the 101 Dalmatians origins story starring Emma Stone. Cinemas had hoped to see their capacity restrictions lifted on 21 June in line with the wider measures, but questions are now being raised over the feasibility of such actions.
Pink: All I Know So Far review – parenting meets perilous pop stardom	The title of this fly-on-the-wall documentary following the pop star Pink and family on her 2018-19 world tour is taken from a recent song in which the Pennsylvanian lung-buster explains her life thus far to her daughter Willow. Traipsing round various European cities, we learn en route that the singer also wrote letters, to be read in the future, to her eldest child on the day she was born and on her first day at kindergarten. Her commitment to her two kids – which goes as far as taking them on tour – is touching, and Pink fans will doubtless be hopping at the prospect of being invited into the domestic circle. But this undemanding work, directed by The Greatest Showman’s Michael Gracey, comes across a bit like another family memento for their own mantelpiece. “Re-sil-ience,” is how Pink chops up a difficult word for her two-year-old, Jameson. Dealing in similarly manageable chunks with the biathlon of parenting and high-end stadium performance that is her life must be the only way of getting through it. The singer is admirably hands-on with both her children (with husband Carey Hart on daddy day care), as well as working out the details of a painstakingly choreographed stage show that at points is close to musical theatre. One interesting point is the physical strain on her: the film points out that the former gymnast often simultaneously sings and performs acrobatics, two activities that pull in different directions. Her wire stunts on show at Wembley stadium, dozens of feet above the arena floor, are truly hair-raising. (Perhaps that explains the coiffure.) But there is little narrative, beyond the Wembley gig approaching; and, more crucially, little conflict, outer or inner. Gracey lets Pink run with too much bland affirmational musing, ranging from the diverse family that is her crew, to the self-actualising lifestyle in which she is raising her children. This all serves to bolster her Streisandesque diva status, but it comes across as a bit self-congratulatory. The fanbase will cheer the fact she has outgrown the self-questioning and fractured home life – cursorily detailed here – from which she made her early career. But that happiness – notoriously difficult to make drama out of – is perhaps left to her songs. • Pink: All I Know So Far is released on Amazon Prime Video on 21 May.
PG: Psycho Goreman review – controlling a demon alien is child’s play	Siblings Mimi (Nita-Josee Hanna, outrageously talented), a ferocious force of nature, and her timid older brother Luke (Owen Myre, also terrific) find a strange, glowing gem while messing around in the dirt. Turns out it summons a blue-hued, bad-tempered alien (actor Matthew Ninaber under a ton of makeup and prosthetics) from the planet Gygax; considered a “demon” by his enemies, he describes himself as “the archduke of nightmares”. However, once Mimi works out they can control him with the gem, she renames him Psycho Goreman, or PG for short. Delighted with this new source of power, Mimi goes on to prove there is truly no force in the universe more capricious, cruel and catty than a 12-year-old who can have anything they want. Soon, she is forcing PG to turn her brother’s friend Alasdair (Scout Flint) into a squat monster that looks like a giant brain with craft-shop googly eyes, as well as compelling everyone to play a ridiculously otiose sport she made up, the rules of which take hours to explain. Writer-director Steven Kostanski is a wee bit over-reliant on bathos to generate humour; just about every laugh is generated by PG declaiming something menacing or committing an act of violence and then being treated like a naughty puppy by Mimi. Nevertheless, the gag is worked over from enough different angles to keep it funny, and it helps that Hanna, Ninaber and the rest of the cast have acute comic timing and know how to sell the material. Meanwhile, the makeup effects for PG, Alasdair and a whole menagerie of alien monsters are unnervingly moist and menacing. It’s no surprise to learn Kostanski has worked as a special makeup artist on bigger budget projects such as Suicide Squad and It, but this proves he has a way with actors as much as a knack for latex and fake blood. • PG: Psycho Goreman is available on Shudder from 20 May.
The Philosophers review – thought-experiment thriller is hilariously bad	John Huddles’s sci-fi thriller unintentionally succeeds in replicating the exact experience of playing “would you rather?” with a friend in a pub, as in it starts out with vague philosophical questions but ends up being utterly ridiculous. And just like the silly game, for the right viewers The Philosophers could be quite a fun watch, despite the sub-par film-making. The film opens with a sweet love scene between Petra (Sophie Lowe) and James (Rhys Wakefield), shot with an awful Vaseline-like sheen that plagues the entire film’s cinematography. Petra and James meet on a philosophy course, which, for some reason, takes place in Indonesia – and yet most of the students are white. For the final class, their professor Mr Zimit (James D’Arcy) proposes some light role play: he devises an extreme situation where the students face an apocalyptic event and must decide who earns a place in the safety bunker. The sci-fi elements kick in as the film sets these thought experiments into motion and showcases various scenic Indonesian locations. While the premise is interesting enough, and it is refreshing to see sci-fi elements used to visualise philosophical problems, The Philosophers, to be honest, is nonsense. Don’t expect to learn any actual philosophy here; these thought experiments favour randomised dramatic incidents over logical reasoning. The dialogue and the acting are also hilariously bad; at one point, a character says, with a straight face: “We need to get a pregnancy going as fast as we can.” However, it’s difficult to write this movie off completely: there is some pleasure to be had in watching these students attempt to solve the different iterations of the experiment over and over, like advancing through the stages of a video game. Ultimately, you might have a good time, in that proverbial so-bad-it’s-good fashion. • The Philosophers is released on 24 May on digital platforms.
My New York Year review – a leaden take on the literary life	There are Farrow &amp; Ball paint charts with more inherent drama than My New York Year, an enervating adaptation of Joanna Rakoff’s 2014 memoir, My Salinger Year. Philippe Falardeau (Monsieur Lazhar) directs and Margaret Qualley stars as aspiring writer Joanna, who finds work assisting grande dame literary agent Margaret (Sigourney Weaver). Margaret’s main client is JD Salinger; Joanna’s duties include shredding his fanmail and replying with a crisply dismissing pro forma response that hasn’t been updated since the late 60s. But just as Salinger’s literature touches the lives of his fans, their heartfelt words (spoken to camera in clunky vignettes) connect with Joanna, incrementally inching her towards dumping her overconfident talent vacuum of a boyfriend and following her dream. It’s all perfectly pleasant, with polite pacing and a smothering, over-solicitous score. But any film that can take an actor as sparky as Qualley and deliver a character with the personality of a damp dishcloth wrapped in a cardigan is seriously underusing its year in New York.
Initiation review – campus horror is more bore than gore	Here’s a trashy, slashy horror movie that takes the issue of sexual assault on campus, removes a few layers of complexity and adds a masked serial killer armed with a power drill. It begins at a frat house party where alpha-scumbag Beau (Gattlin Griffith) sets his aim with sniper precision at Kylie (Isabella Gomez), the drunkest, most-eager-to-fit-in of the new sorority intake. Beau offers to take her to the upstairs bathroom; instead he guides her into his bedroom with another guy, Wes (Froy Gutierrez), and locks the door. The next day Kylie tells sorority president Ellery (Lindsay LaVanchy) that she thinks she might have been assaulted. The frat boys tag her as a “slut” on social media. (Irritatingly, the characters’ messages and social feeds are constantly pinging up on the screen.) Ellery, a science major, takes the investigation into her own hands at the DNA lab where she works part-time. Meanwhile, a masked psychopath turns up on campus, stalking and killing the suspected perpetrators and anyone else who might be complicit. The kills get boring very quickly; I’ve seen cheese-grater injuries that were more grisly. And perhaps the biggest shocker here is that these kids are glued to their phones 24/7, but not one of them manages to dial 911 in time. The procedural side of things is pretty hopeless. The script throws out half a dozen creepy male characters, any one of whom could be the killer. There’s Ellery’s socially awkward incel-y boss at the lab (Maxwell Hamilton), and the college principal (Lochlyn Munro), who’s hushed up previous allegations. What about that nice cop (Jon Huertas) – doesn’t he maintain eye contact for a split second too long? The unmasking of the killer at the end is completely nonsensical in what is essentially a perpetrator-focused film; Kylie, the alleged victim, gets a couple of scenes, necessary for the plot, but otherwise, there’s practically zero interest in what she’s going through. • Initiation is released on 24 May on digital platforms.
The Human Factor review – gripping account of three decades of Middle East peace talks	It’s barely conceivable now, with the conflict between Israel and Palestine at its most destructive in years, but for a while at least, an accord in the Middle East was a tantalising possibility. This fascinating, balanced documentary from the Oscar-nominated Israeli film-maker Dror Moreh (The Gatekeepers) does for behind-the-scenes statecraft and diplomacy what Errol Morris’s 2003 film The Fog of War did for military strategy. Moreh’s gripping account of three decades of the Middle East peace process is simple in approach, sharing with The Gatekeepers an emphasis on insight, analysis and expertise. In this case, the fluctuating tensions between Israel and its neighbours Palestine and Syria are recounted by the US negotiators tasked with brokering something that one of them, senior diplomatic interpreter Gamal Helal, was reluctant to even label as “peace”, arguing that the word itself was loaded with unrealistic expectations. When the schisms between the two sides even extend to semantics – the Arab concept of “future” differed from that of the US and Israelis – it’s remarkable that they came as close as they did to an agreement. We learn that negotiation is a delicate structure that is all too easily toppled by the whims of powerful men. Something as inconsequential as Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat’s fondness for uniforms could come close to scuppering months of precision-tooled arbitration. And the “human factor” was crucial, encompassing everything from the mutual respect between Yitzhak Rabin and Arafat, to the all too human errors of judgment that, interviewees concede, may have cost them the chance of peace.
The 8th review – powerful account of the fight to repeal Ireland’s anti-abortion law	The grassroots campaign that led to one of the single most important moments in the history of women’s rights is documented in this solid, stirring and frequently very affecting film. A dedicated band of Irish women toiled away for over three decades with the aim of repealing the 8th amendment, a draconian piece of anti-abortion legislation that gave the unborn foetus equal rights to the mother. There are charismatic figures fronting the movement, but the real power comes from each of the many shared, sad stories from women whose lives were affected by the law.
Peter Rabbit 2: the Runaway review – amusingly self-aware sequel	The furry scourge of gardeners everywhere returns. But this instalment of Peter Rabbit is filtered through the kind of sly self-awareness that suggests the film-makers took on board the criticisms of the previous film and decided to run with them. Thus there’s a repeated joke about Peter’s annoying voice (James Corden returns as the lead bunny) and a meta gag about the commercial pressures that sever the screen adventures of Peter and chums from their chintzy Beatrix Potter origins. Yes, the shadow of Paddington looms large. But there are some genuinely funny moments, and the madcap action set pieces – particularly a farmers’ market heist – are giddily inventive. Fur rendering and CGI is first-rate, for the animals at least. The humans fare less well: as Mr McGregor, the CGI Domhnall Gleeson at times looks like a collection of overstretched slinky springs in a man suit.
Nasrin review – this is what a superhero looks like in the real world	This clandestinely shot documentary about Iranian human-rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh reveals what superheroism looks like in the real world. As significant as the tireless work in lawyer’s cabinets, drab constitutional courts and prison visiting rooms is her symbolic importance: her sinewy persistence and true courage in standing up to Iran’s dogmatic regime have the potential to ignite such qualities in others, and unlock the collective action needed to shift this sclerotic society. Narrated by Olivia Colman, the film details how this one-time journalist began practising law in 2003, specialising in representing minorities, opposition activists and minors on death row – all groups denied the human rights Iran’s clerics claim are incompatible with Islamic values. Sotoudeh was arrested for endangering state security in 2010, and served more than two years in Tehran’s Evin prison, where she undertook a 50-day hunger strike. The totalitarianism she is fighting against is on display in one scene where, advocating for an activist on trial at the Revolutionary Court, Sotoudeh asks for evidence to back the charge of colluding with foreign powers. There is none. An apparatchik demands to know why she is “defending true bandits, who are homosexuals, Baha’is, prostitutes, terrorists and street and wilderness thugs”. This Orwellian modus operandi, rewriting reality as the regime needs, is supposedly in the service of upholding traditional values. But on some level, the regime holds family in contempt too. As seen through Sotoudeh’s husband Reza’s weariness, this is evidently their first point of attack, the interminable prison sentences psychologically designed to break down this unit of solidarity. Sotoudeh’s legal work and street activism show the value of strategic resistance, and are timed when – for domestic or international reasons – they are most likely to extract concessions. In concert with other high-profile dissenters, such as director Jafar Panahi, in whose film Taxi she appears, she seems to be making headway – especially following reformist cleric Hassan Rouhani’s election as president in 2013. But there is no redemptive final act. The film finishes in 2018, when Sotoudeh was rearrested and sentenced to 38 years and 148 lashes. That was commuted, but she remains incarcerated. • Nasrin is available on 28 May on True Story.
Timothée Chalamet to play Willy Wonka in origins movie	Timothée Chalamet is set to take on the role of Willy Wonka in a new origins movie. According to Deadline, the Oscar-nominated star of Call Me by Your Name will follow in the footsteps of Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp in an all-singing and all-dancing performance in a prequel inspired by Roald Dahl’s book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The film will focus on the early years of Wonka before he opened his factory. Paul King, director of Paddington, will be at the helm with a screenplay from comedian Simon Farnaby. It will mark the third time Warner Brothers has brought the character to life, first in 1971 and then in 2005 with Tim Burton’s adaptation, which made $475m worldwide. The story was also turned into a successful musical. Last year it was announced that Taika Waititi, director of Thor: Ragnarok, would also be taking on two animated series for Netflix based on the world and characters of Dahl’s 1964 novel. The streamer has promised that the shows will “retain the quintessential spirit and tone of the original story while building out the world and characters far beyond the pages of the Dahl book for the very first time”. The 25-year-old actor was last seen in Greta Gerwig’s adaptation of Little Women and his upcoming films include Wes Anderson’s The French Dispatch, Denis Villeneuve’s take on Dune, marking his first major franchise role, and Adam McKay’s star-studded asteroid comedy Don’t Look Up alongside Jennifer Lawrence, Leonardo DiCaprio, Meryl Streep and Ariana Grande. The most recent adaptation of Dahl’s work was Robert Zemeckis’s version of The Witches starring Anne Hathaway and Octavia Spencer. Wonka is set to be released in 2023.
Hello, It’s Me! review – mysteries of love and science in wartime Armenia	This intriguing and mysterious romantic drama from 1966 is directed by Armenian film-maker Frunze Dovlatyan; it was entered into competition at Cannes that year and is now rereleased. Hello, It’s Me! often has that kind of freewheeling breeziness that you might associate with the 60s; at other times, I found myself thinking of Max Ophüls’s Letter from an Unknown Woman. The distinguished Armenian stage and screen actor Armen Dzhigarkhanyan plays a fictional young scientist called Artyom, based on the real-life figure of Artem Alikhanian, who during the second world war became one of the pioneers of Soviet nuclear physics. (He shares this distinction, incidentally, with the great Soviet scientist Lev Landau, whose life story was the unlikely inspiration for Ilya Khrzhanovsky’s epic movie installation project Dau.) Artyom has a deep friendship with his comrade and colleague Oleg (Rolan Bykov) and is deeply in love with Lyusya (Natalya Fateeva). But the war shatters everything in his personal life, even as it accelerates his scientific work. Lyusya – a sergeant in the Red Army – is suddenly ordered to the front, where she is to be killed in action, having had no time to say goodbye to Artyom. Her desperate attempt, as she is scrambling on board a troop train, to get a message to him via a child, is the nearest to a farewell they had. Artyom, meanwhile, is sent to Mount Aragats in the remote Armenian highlands to set up the Cosmic Ray Research Station, considered by the authorities of great wartime importance, and is separated from Oleg. After the war, there is regret and sadness in Artyom’s life, complicated by an enigmatic new relationship with a beautiful young woman called Tanya (Margarita Terekhova, later to play the lead in Tarkovsky’s Mirror), whose destiny was entwined with Artyom’s from the very beginning. It really is a very strange film: abstruse scientific work is juxtaposed with romanticism, yearning, loneliness, eroticism and a mystified acceptance of the workings of fate. • Hello, It’s Me! is available from 25 May on Klassiki. •This article was amended on 24 May 2021 to correct the film’s release date in the standfirst
Baby Jaws? Scar Face the Lion? The origin stories we’d like to see	Nobody is ever really evil any more. The entertainment world has been working overtime filling in villain backstories lately, providing excuses and rationales for everyone from Joker to Maleficent, Hannibal to Nurse Ratched. Next up we have Disney’s Cruella, explaining what turned the 101 Dalmatians vamp from promising fashion designer to puppy-skinning wrong-un. What’s left when even a mass pet-killer is worthy of rehabilitation? Well, if you’re listening, Hollywood, here are a few ideas … Scar Face Jeff, as he was known back then, is the handsomest, most popular lion on the savannah. He is a gifted wildlife artist, and a vegetarian. Jeff’s prayers are answered when a comely lioness asks him to paint her portrait, but his brother Mufasa gets jealous and sends round the baboon mafia to mess him up. The disfigured Jeff falls into a radioactive waterhole, which turns him evil. Jaws Junior: The Baby Shark Murders An innocent young shark pup growing up in Cape Cod is devastated when its mummy goes missing. Then daddy shark disappears. Then grandma shark. Then grandpa shark. A serial killer is hunting down Jaws’s family. Accompanied by a wisecracking halibut and a stoner squid, our hero sets off to find the culprit. They fail, so decide to eat everyone instead. Alien: Try to See Things from My Side A small-town xenomorph who dreams of bigger things elopes with a charming travelling salesmorph (or so he says). But after becoming pregnant, she catches him hugging the face of another. This resourceful single mother vows her several hundred children will never go hungry. The Curse of Bates We all know what turned Norman Bates into Psycho. And thanks to Bates Motel, we kind of know what turned Mother into Mother as well. But what about her mother? Turns out she was a nightmare, too. And her mother before that. In fact, as successive prequels reveal, the cursed Bates line extends all the way back to seventh-century Northumbria. Frozen Out Not a Disney movie (though if you buy a ticket thinking it is, that’s fine), but the tale of a happy little iceberg in the Arctic. On Christmas Eve, 1911, it is cruelly separated from the family ice shelf by a crashed conservation ship. As it drifts alone across the north Atlantic for four months, its innocence hardens into resolve. It plots revenge against all shipkind.
Drunk Bus review – endearing odd couple keep slacker comedy on track	Packed with a host of off-kilter characters and traversing some over-familiar indie terrain, this slacker comedy co-directed by John Carlucci and Brandon LaGanke could easily have seemed grating. Nevertheless, believable performances, along with a deep understanding of place, lend Drunk Bus a cheeriness that is entertaining and heartwarming. Just like the creaky campus bus that he has driven around the same route every night for the past four years, recent graduate Michael (Charlie Tahan) is stuck in a depressing loop. His Catholic girlfriend Amy (Sarah Mezzanotte) has left him for New York, while the still-virgin Michael remains in Kent, Ohio. His daily dealings with drunk students and aggressive, burrito-throwing frat boys bear the same approach: meek numbness and exasperated acceptance. His directionless apathy changes when, after a minor scuffle, Pineapple (Pineapple Tangaroa), an intimidating-looking Samoan security guard with a full facial tattoo, is assigned to protect the bus. The pair make for an endearing odd couple as Pineapple nudges Michael on to a more carefree path. While Pineapple could have easily fallen into something similar to the “Magical Negro” trope, where a non-white character functions as a life coach for the white protagonist – and admittedly the script does occasionally veer in this direction – Tangaroa is such a hugely charismatic performer that he rises above such constraints. The film also balances out the quirkiness – a character is nicknamed Night Tara because she has night terrors – with a real appreciation for Kent itself. It is a dead town, yes, but Drunk Bus captures the spirit of the community there: by showing the local diner or the snowy, sloping streets where the characters slide around. While the mix of drama and comedy is shaky, Drunk Bus is still a rewarding watch. • Drunk Bus is released on 24 May on digital platforms.
Lindsay Lohan is back – as Netflix signs her for Christmas romcom	Lindsay Lohan has been signed up by Netflix for Christmas movie as she aims to restart her stalled film acting career. Variety reports that Lohan has signed up to appear in a seasonally themed romantic comedy for the streaming giant, which has made a practice out of releasing such films in recent years, including The Christmas Chronicles, Home for Christmas and A Family Reunion Christmas. According to Variety, Lohan will play a “newly engaged, spoiled hotel heiress [who] finds herself in the care of a handsome, blue-collar lodge owner and his precocious daughter in the days leading up to Christmas” after a skiing accident renders her with memory loss. The film, as yet untitled, is to be directed and co-written by Janeen Damian, and is likely to be ready for Christmas 2022. Lohan’s acting jobs have been sporadic since appearing in the Paul Schrader-directed The Canyons in 2013, with a supporting role in the werewolf thriller Among the Shadows in 2019 her only film credit. She also appeared in an episode of 2 Broke Girls in 2014, and as a regular character in the second series of the Rupert Grint sitcom Sick Note in 2018. She also accrued largely positive reviews for the 2014 West End production of David Mamet’s play Speed-the-Plow. Lohan’s success as a child actor, in the 1998 remake of The Parent Trap and the 2003 version of Freaky Friday, as well as the cult hit Mean Girls in 2004, was followed by highly publicised personal and legal difficulties, including substance abuse, driving-offence convictions, probation violations, jail time and spells in rehab. Lohan subsequently featured in reality TV shows, including Lindsay, which followed her recovery attempts in 2014, and Lindsay Lohan’s Beach Club, broadcast in 2019, about her plan to manage a beach bar in Greece. She also acted as a judge on the Australian version of The Masked Singer.
No Man’s Land review – well-meaning drama about US-Mexico relations	Just north of the border between the United States and Mexico, the Greer family – patriarch Bill (Frank Grillo), mom Monica (Andie MacDowell), and grown sons Lucas (Alex MacNicoll) and Jackson (Jake Allyn) – work the land as ranchers. They raise cattle, ride horses and, being red-blooded Texan types, play sports – in Jackson’s case well enough that he’s got a chance to go pro as a baseball player. They also spend the odd evening riding the range with a vigilante militia group, rounding up immigrants who may have crossed the border illegally, to “help” the border patrols. On one such night, Jackson joins his dad and big brother, even though they try to keep him out of this sort of thing so he can get out of Dodge and become a sports hero – and what do you know, the dumb lug ends up shooting and killing a boy (Alessio Valentini) just a little younger than himself. In the back no less. Ashamed, distraught and worried that his father will try to take the rap for him, Jackson confesses to local Texas Ranger Ramirez (venerable character actor George Lopez), but then bolts across the border to Mexico on his trusty horse Sundance. Soon, the fugitive is learning some life lessons and about what Mexico is really like, and he becomes a hired hand for a nice middle-class family. A flirtatious friendship blooms between him and the family’s pretty daughter, Victoria (Esmeralda Pimentel), while he tries not to get caught by the dead kid’s dad Gustavo (Jorge A Jimenez) and a skeevy people-trafficking “coyote” (Andres Delgado), who are out to get him. This is clearly a well-intentioned film and not as entirely focused on the moral education of a gringo as the above would suggest; a lot of screen time is taken up with Gustavo’s own ethical crisis. However, the script – credited to the star Jake Allyn, his director brother Conor and a third Allyn named Rob, as well as Joel Shapiro – is as on the nose as a didactic punch to the face. But as contemporary westerns go, this one is at least nice to look at, with the endless shots of landscapes at magic hour. • No Man’s Land is released on 31 May on digital platforms.
Elyse review – Anthony Hopkins turns psychiatrist in portrait of a troubled woman	This peculiar, freakishly uneven but far from meritless psychological drama stars Lisa Pepper as the title character, a soigné but very intense woman in early middle age who seems both on the verge of nervous breakdown and under the influence of some kind of emotional malady. Elyse is married to Stephen Bridges (Aaron Tucker), a successful lawyer, and they have a young son (Griffin Thomas Hollander); the boy is largely looked after by the family’s housekeeper Julia (Julieta Ortiz) while Elyse drifts about through her day, browsing at bookshops, stroking donuts she doesn’t eat, all the while carrying a camera she barely uses even though she’s meant to be a photographer of some sort. But the placid surface of this Los Angeleno style-magazine existence is suddenly broken by violent eruptions of temper from Elyse, directed mostly at Julia’s daughter Carmen (Tara Arroyave), who also lives with the Bridges and works for Stephen as an intern, as well as Elyse’s own mother Goldie (Fran Tucker), who Elyse accuses of plotting against her. Eventually, they manage to persuade Elyse to see a psychiatrist, Dr Lewis (Anthony Hopkins), and some clues as to what’s really going on begin to emerge. Suffice it to say that in a strange way this film is something of a gender-flipped companion piece to The Father, for which Hopkins just won an Oscar – only this time he’s a supporting character instead of the protagonist. Unfortunately director Stella Hopkins, who also co-wrote the film with Audrey Arkins, doesn’t have comparable directorial skill to The Father’s Florian Zeller. The tonal shifts flicker like a strobe light, while the mannered use of black and white, with a later shift to full colour, comes across as pretentious and literal rather than evocative of the character’s inner state. And despite the fact that she’s married to Hopkins, Stella Hopkins seems to struggle with getting the best out of the other actors in her cast, whose performances range from the merely stiff to painfully hammy and embarrassing and back to just inept. Lead actor Pepper’s work runs the full gamut, even going so far as to be outright excellent in later scenes when her character is at her lowest ebb. The final reveal is so melodramatic and excessive it is faintly ridiculous, but there’s still a nugget of real emotional truth here in the film’s portrait of trauma and depression. • Elyse is released on 31 May on digital platforms.
Dinner in America review – quirky couple take a trip through suburbia 	“Is weird cool?” “In your case, no.” This pert exchange summarises the style of writer-director Adam Rehmeier’s indie dramedy, with two very good lead performers whose unexpected chemistry gradually makes this film likable. It’s about an angry punk singer with a pyromania fetish and a lonely and nerdy young woman with ADHD who is his biggest fan. Kyle Gallner plays John Q Public (real name: Simon), the lead singer of a band called Psy Ops who performs anonymously in a balaclava; off-stage, he has a vocal-fry badass voice, like Ray Liotta in GoodFellas. Simon is experiencing furious musical differences with the rest of the band and is making money through selling weed and taking part in big pharma medical experiments. Emily Skeggs is excellent as quirky, dreamy Patty, who takes indistinct Polaroids of herself masturbating to his music in her childhood bedroom and sends them to him via the mailbox address on the band’s flyers. But, when Simon gets into trouble after setting something on fire, Patty shields him from the police, never dreaming that he is the object of her self-pleasuring fan correspondence; meanwhile, he has no idea that this irritating dork has been sending him the (rather gratifying) photos. Soon the pair are getting into criminal scrapes together, like a low-rent Bonnie and Clyde who never actually travel anywhere. Simon’s most famous song, evidently, is something called Dinner in America, and this film proceeds in a series of three desperately uncomfortable middle-class family dinners with three different families, Simon being a smouldering guest at each. The “dinner table scene with sulky kids” scene is a staple of US indie movies satirising suburban ennui, and this could have been a cliche. But Rehmeier creates something amusing and offbeat in each one, and Pat Healy and Mary Lynn Rajskub are entertaining as Patty’s uptight parents. Twenty years ago, Sam Mendes’s American Beauty and Todd Solondz’s Happiness were at opposite ends of the spectrum of difficult weirdness for this kind of material, Solondz setting a gold standard for strangeness, dysfunction and discomfort. Rehmeier is at the American Beauty end of things. His film has its own truculent charm. • Dinner in America is released on digital platforms on 1 June.
Demon Slayer the Movie: Mugen Train review – an anime fever dream	If, like me, you have not watched the hit 2019 Japanese TV series Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, let alone read the manga series it was based on, then you may struggle somewhat to understand exactly what’s going on in this feature-length instalment in the saga. But even if you don’t dive into Google to work out the backstory, it’s not that hard get the hang of; or at least who are the slayers and who are the demons. The good guy slayers have huge eyes, albeit ones with weird polygonal shapes and strangely coloured irises, while the evil demons often have kanji characters where their pupils should be, as well as shapeshifting abilities. The latter also have hard-to-define but distinctly “villainous” voices, while the good guys tend to speak in a staccato, declamatory fashion, prone to awkward enunciations such as: “While this our first time meeting, I already dislike you.” Either way, the animation is fantastic, a superb blend of classic anime character design supplemented by CGI effects and swooping camera work. The action, like South Korean features Snowpiercer or Train to Busan, takes place mostly on a train where the demon slayers – brunette, magenta-eyed hero Tanjiro Kamado, his tame demon sister Nezuko, blond pretty boy Zenitsu Agatsuma and shouty half-man-half-boar Inosuke Hashibira – come to find a slaying master Kyojuro, who has unique fire-adjacent properties. But just as the ensemble are getting to know each other, they are sent into sleep comas by a powerful demon and his bewitched child demons. In his dreams, Tanjiro meets his family once again – the ones who were killed by demons in the TV series – and the others have similar reveries, compelling them to decide which reality they want to live in. Squint a bit, relax your mind and you might find in it a touching allegory that accidentally corresponds to our own, collective emergence from the oneiric, mesmeric lull of lockdown life, in which sleeping too much and dreaming about dead loved ones could have become the new going out. • Demon Slayer the Movie: Mugen Train is released on 26 May in cinemas.
Bank Job review – a classic ‘print money to cancel debt’ caper	Not to be confused with the Jason Statham heist caper, here’s a likable documentary with a big heart and some punch-the-air moments from husband and wife team Hilary Powell and Daniel Edelstyn. The film is the story of how they opened a “bank” on their high street in Walthamstow, north-east London, and printed money – a kind of art-installation-meets-community-activism project. On the banknotes they replaced the Queen’s head with portraits of local heroes: a food bank founder on the fiver; a soup kitchen volunteer on the tenner; a youth leader on the 20; a primary school headteacher on the 50. The project was inspired by the Rolling Jubilee Fund in America, which bought $3.8m worth of students’ loans in 2014 and cancelled the debt. So, with the £40,000 raised from selling their art banknotes, Powell and Edelstyn spent half buying back £1.2m of debt owed by ordinary people in Walthamstow. (It cost so little because debt is sold for significantly less on the secondary market because it’s unlikely all of it will be paid back). In a lovely scene they print letters to inform people that their debts have been paid off – posting them in nice expensive envelopes, not official-looking A4 ones with windows, which might put off the recipients from opening them. The other £20,000 was donated to the causes that feature on the banknotes. Sweetly, the pair have kept in their bickering, and financial experts chip in to explain the rise of toxic debt culture. The film ends with Powell and Edelstyn blowing up a gold Ford Transit van full of “money” across the river from Canary Wharf, notes fluttering in the breeze – a symbolic gesture and homage to The Italian Job; though sadly they don’t manage to blow the bloody doors off. • Bank Job is released on 28 May in cinemas.
British delegates to Cannes hit by new French quarantine rules	British participation in at the Cannes film festival is under threat after new quarantine regulations put into place by the French government as the country seeks to successfully exit lockdown. After delays caused by Covid, the festival confirmed it would take place in early July, but France has announced a seven-day isolation period for visitors from the UK in response to rising concerns over the Covid variant B.1.617.2, first detected in India. The move is likely to affect thousands, both among the press corps and industry delegates, and large numbers of unregistered attendees. A government spokesperson said: “There is a new situation with the progression of the so-called Indian variant in the United Kingdom. [France] will set up compulsory isolation for people coming from the United Kingdom.” The spokesperson added that more details would be made available “in the next few hours”. Delegates and press from the US, another significant section of Cannes attendees, also face obstacles, but at present appear less restrictive for July. Non-EU visitors will be permitted to visit for all types of travel after the second stage of reopening on 9 June, provided infection figures are acceptable, and it is likely that visitors will need a “pass sanitaire” or health passport. In a statement to the Guardian, a spokesperson for the festival said they were attempting to find a way to accommodate participants. “We are currently in a day-to-day conversation with the relevant government authorities to find the best option for the festival. At this time we cannot give any details about the measures that will be in place in July, but we are confident that we will be able to communicate about this early in June.”
School of Rock star Kevin Clark dies in collision aged 32	School of Rock star Jack Black was among those paying tribute to Kevin Clark, who as a 13-year-old had played drummer Freddy in the hit 2003 film, after Clark was killed in a collision on Wednesday 26 May. The Chicago Sun Times reported that Clark, 32, had been hit by a car while cycling in the Avondale area of the city late at night, and that the car driver had been issued with several citations. Black posted a photograph of himself with Clark in the movie on social media, alongside a more recent picture, writing: “Devastating news. Kevin is gone. Way too soon. Beautiful soul. So many great memories. Heartbroken. Sending love to his family and the whole School of Rock community.” Clark’s mother Allison Clark told the Chicago Sun Times that he had just formed a new band. “He loved music. He’s just a raw talent. He’s got a heart of gold.” She also said he had no plans to be an actor when he auditioned as a 12-year-old for the film, and won the role of drummer Freddy Jones. Directed by Richard Linklater, School of Rock proved to be a major commercial success, though Clark opted not to pursue acting but to become a professional musician. Miranda Cosgrove, who appeared as Summer alongside Clark in School of Rock, also posted a tribute on social media, writing: “Stunned and saddened by this news today. The world lost an amazing soul. I’ll always remember your spirit and how kind you were to me. I’ll never forget all the memories. You’ll always be missed Kevin.”
Skull: The Mask review – a masterclass in over-the-top butchery	Anyone who wanted more of the human-sacrifice scene in Mel Gibson’s Apocalypto will be overjoyed by this silly, uneven but strangely appealing slasher film that leaves no heart unripped from human thorax. A mystifying prologue sees Nazis unearth a grotesque pre-Colombian skull mask, which looks like Darth Maul’s Sunday best. The artefact resurfaces in modern-day São Paulo where, after chewing up the archaeologist who found it, it attaches itself to one of the crime-scene cleaners. He is transformed into a host for Anhangá, an indigenous demon who loves an old-school blood sacrifice. Here’s hoping the actor in the mask (Brazilian wrestler Rurik Jr) didn’t make any earnest thespian inquiries about Anhangá’s motivation, because this is a tough one to answer. It’s hinted he’s on a lumbering journey towards a church where a rival god’s femur is kept; Manco (Wilton Andrade) – a fruit-seller who is also part of some ancient order – is determined to intervene. Also following the entrails is detective Beatriz (Natallia Rodrigues), who is blackmailed into cooperating with a gaunt corporate CEO (Ivo Müller) planning to use the mask in a ritual involving abducted Bolivian children. By the time Anhangá is making carpaccio of a nightclub full of ravers, it’s clear his motivation is really to provide steady employment for Brazil’s practical-effects artists. This, in fact, is co-director Kapel Furman’s background – and, from scooped-out torsos to the vine-like appendages writhing around the killer’s body, he undeniably delivers. The profusion of plot strands is almost as messy as the omnipresent innards – and any intended social comment about the influence of Brazilian plutocrats gets lost down there. But, while it lacks focus, there’s a rude vigour about Skull: The Mask, which has as many passages of exciting film-making as amateurish ones. The exploitation film-style prologue suggests Machete on a South American holiday, and the directors use drones and digital shooting to skilfully scope out the concrete spaces of the climax. The butchery is interspersed with eerie inserts – blood welling up inside a chalice, for example – that grasp at a more mystical tone than elsewhere. A surprisingly vibrant addition to the charnel house. • Skull: The Mask is on Shudder.
Zebra Girl review – cartoon murder splices iffily with other serious issues	This low-budget indie set in the dark heart of the rural English suburbs begins with a woman plunging an eight-inch kitchen knife into her husband’s head. The tone that director Stephanie Zari is going for seems to be that blend of violence and black humour that Fargo and Killing Eve make look so easy. But Zebra Girl’s quirky comedy is not quite distinctive enough, and the script lurches iffily into serious issues of child abuse and mental illness in the second half. Sarah Roy plays the murderer, Catherine, who grabs a knife from the cutlery drawer after catching husband Dan (Tom Cullen) watching unpleasant porn at 3am in the study of their country pile. A shrieky horror movie score blares as she does the deed and afterwards she wraps a fluffy pink towel around his head. The next morning, she calls in childhood friend Anita (Jade Anouka), who is shocked – but not exactly surprised – to walk in on a murder scene. It turns out that Catherine’s plummily posh private school accent and Tory chic fashion taste (pink cashmere knits and pearl earrings) are an affectation. What’s also clear is that she’s a psychopath without a trace of conscience. “Help me bag this bastard up,” she snaps at Anita. Even with the deadpan one-liners she’s not an interesting or layered character. In flashback we see Catherine and university lecturer Dan meet and fall in love. On their first date she is manic and awkward, telling him about her dark past. He’s taken aback, but not put off. “You were a national story,” he marvels. That past emerges in flashback, too, in scenes showing Catherine as a little girl (played Daisy Mayer), then as precocious teenager (Isabelle Connolly) being questioned at a police station. For me, the cartoonish violence and flippancy of the adult bit belongs to a different film from some of the upsetting episodes elsewhere. • Zebra Girl is in cinemas from 28 May.
Granada Nights review – voyage of heartbreak and self-discovery in Spain’s deep south	The premise of Granada Nights, the directorial debut from Abid Khan, seems promising enough, in that it reimagines the tired subgenre of a sad white guy going to a foreign country and learning how to live, love and laugh. Unfortunately, while refreshingly centring a British Asian protagonist, Khan’s film is hopelessly bogged down by a thin plot and cliched dialogues. Square, Instagram-like framing opens this journey of self-discovery, capturing reserved 24-year-old Ben (Antonio Aakeel) en route from London to Granada, Spain, to surprise his long-distance girlfriend, Helen. The tight composition oozes anxiety, and Ben’s apprehensions are sadly proved right: Helen doesn’t even want to see his face. Heartbroken and sneering at hostels, Ben is persuaded by spunky backpacker Amelia (Quintessa Swindell) to stay and explore the city. One night turns into weeks and months as the formerly shy guy gets immersed in the buzzing international student scene. The aspect ratios gradually expand – reminiscent of Xavier Dolan’s Mommy – as the framing mirrors Ben’s newly acquired open-mindedness and inner peace. Despite these ambitious stylistic flourishes, Granada Nights remains a frustrating watch. The gap is too apparent between what the film wants to be – a Richard Linklater-esque European wandering – and what the film actually is. Some of the writing is glaringly weak, especially in the first half where every line sounds like a contrived inspirational quote. As a result, this is at its best when there is no dialogue, and the camera simply follows Ben through the beautiful, ancient streets. The city comes alive then, but the drunken indoor student parties overshadow outdoor sequences. Considering the script is based on Khan’s own experience during a sabbatical in Spain, it is a shame that such personal healing should transfer so blandly to screen. However, in a post-Brexit world, the film and its host of international characters will certainly make audience pine for the once robust Erasmus programme. • Granada Nights is released in cinemas on 28 May.
Cruella review – Emma Stone is a joy as the refashioned supervillain 	In 1996’s 101 Dalmatians, Glenn Close’s gleefully unhinged performance as a puppy-skinning fashion designer riffed on older audience members’ prior knowledge of the actor as a “bunny boiler” in Fatal Attraction. Emma Stone’s Cruella de Vil is much more grounded and thus not as camp, a supervillain with a believable backstory – born Estella, bullied by boys at school and established as a maverick who’s always refused to “follow the pattern” (as her single mother puts it) in both dressmaking and in life. Set in 1970s London against a backdrop of the emerging punk scene, this playful prequel by Craig Gillespie (I, Tonya) is a fine feat of world-building. Like Phantom Thread or Marie Antoinette, it’s also an excellent fashion film, playing on the myth of the egocentric, detail-oriented genius. One of its main narrative threads involves Estella’s apprenticeship at, and eventual sabotage of, a couture fashion house headed by an icy narcissist named The Baroness (Emma Thompson, exuding Meryl Streep’s energy in The Devil Wears Prada). Fashion enthusiasts may also draw connections between the House of Baroness’s sculptural, Dior-esque gowns and Estella’s Alexander McQueen-influenced lace and leather looks (McQueen, of course, succeeded John Galliano at Givenchy in the 90s when the latter moved to Dior). There is even a reference to McQueen’s 2011 monarch butterfly dress. The film is structured as a family-friendly heist movie that plays out against a series of costume balls. There’s probably one act too many and so the pacing suffers; younger children with shorter attention spans might, too. Still, Stone is a joy: vampy, sneering and as eager to please as a dalmatian.
I Used to Be Normal: A Boyband Fangirl Story review – tears, squeals and boundless devotion	Unless you’ve experienced boyband fandom, it can be difficult to square the contrivance of commercial PG pop acts with the overwhelming, boundless, alchemic devotion felt by their teenage fans. The cultural default is to deride, dismiss and pathologise teenage girls undone by fandom (see, a century before boybands, Lisztomania). In sharp contrast is I Used to Be Normal: A Boyband Fangirl Story, Australian film-maker Jessica Leski’s generous, observational documentary of boyband obsession across four pop generations. The film takes its title from a tearful lament by then 16-year-old Elif, a One Direction superfan in New York, in a viral YouTube video of her melting into tears/panic/excitement at the idea of meeting the band’s Niall Horan. At school and in the clip, Elif is chastised (by herself among others) for her deeply unchill display of feeling. But the 90-minute documentary subtly skewers that idea of normal. Leski smartly understands that fandom is not so much a condition as a portal for universal teenage emotions: a transformative experience of coming into your own, of feeling alive and seen. The film offers a breezy skim through this phenomenon; the bulk of the footage is just listening, in first-person testimonials, to four personal experiences. Dara, a 33-year-old Take That diehard in Australia, provides a succinct overview of the genre’s defining characteristics (three to five band members, categorisable personas, lovelorn lyrics, no mention of sex). Susan, 64, also Australian, recalls Beatledom in the early 60s as an evergreen, unmatchable catharsis. Elif and 25-year-old Sadia, a Backstreet Boys devotee, discuss how online fan communities both alienated them from immigrant parents and helped soothe feelings of unbelonging in the US. More uncomfortable images of gawking or obsession – no-longer-teenage fans, for example, following Nick Carter on a Backstreet Boys cruise like camera-laden hyenas to a gazelle – are unprocessed, as Leski never presses into discomfort or shame harder than the subjects themselves. The film also sidesteps fandom’s potential for toxicity, especially on social media. I Used to Be Normal feels like a balm to anyone who’s watched a music video and fallen into hours of yearning – an experience that is quite normal and even, years later, still formative and viscerally real. • I Used to Be Normal: A Boyband Fangirl Story is released on 31 May on digital platforms.
Earwig and the Witch review – Studio Ghibli’s CGI debut fails to enchant	Directed by Gorō Miyazaki, son of Hayao, Studio Ghibli’s first feature-length foray into computer-generated animation has a clunkiness to it. With her grumpy expression, mismatched socks and pigtails pricked up like antennae, enterprising orphan Earwig (dubbed by Taylor Henderson) is a cute enough creation, but there’s neither believable camaraderie between her and Dan Stevens’s rangy and taciturn black cat, nor sufficient antagonism between her and the blue-haired witch (Vanessa Marshall) who “adopts” and imprisons her. Everything moves a little too slowly, not least the shuffling animation. For a film about magic, there’s little sparkle to spare.
Frankie review – trouble in a Portuguese paradise with Isabelle Huppert	The famously stylish Isabelle Huppert spends a stretch of this handsome drama on her hands and knees. In the verdant foothills of Sintra, Portugal, ailing actor Frankie (Huppert) searches for the €40,000 bracelet her only son, Paul (Jérémie Renier), has tossed into the woods, rejecting her offer of a valuable family heirloom that could be cashed in after her death. It’s that kind of film – one in which depressed rich people go on holiday to argue about death, inheritance tax, diamond jewellery and their deteriorating marriages. The approach taken by director Ira Sachs (Love Is Strange) is utterly sincere and so utterly humourless, though the performances are quietly compelling; Marissa Tomei brings a liquid warmth as Frankie’s American friend Ilene. Sachs plays on Huppert’s queenly presence too. It’s fitting that she gathers her nearest and dearest in a town that was once a sanctuary for the Portuguese nobility.
Surge review – Ben Whishaw shines as a man unravelling	Ben Whishaw’s Joseph is an airport security worker at Stansted. His job involves giving humiliating pat-downs, his home life consists of lonely TV dinners in his Tottenham flat and now, visiting his parents, he can’t even drink a glass of water without being criticised. “You swallow so loudly, Joseph,” complains his mother (Ellie Haddington). No wonder his composure shatters (along with the glass), an incident that sets off a spree of increasingly chaotic behaviour. The frequently handheld camera keeps pace with Joseph’s frenetic energy as he robs a bank and later, in one astonishing scene, rips up a hotel mattress. Assisted by co-writer Rita Kalnejais (Babyteeth), British writer-director Aneil Karia’s debut feature draws from his 2013 short, Beat, which also starred Whishaw as a man propelled by unseen forces. Whishaw’s intensity is gripping to watch but the character remains opaque; whether we’re meant to read Joseph as experiencing psychosis or simply suffering the unforgiving conditions of city life under capitalism is ambiguous.
Dinner in America review – odd-couple romcom with punk flavour	Those who identified with the girl geeks of Ghost World and Welcome to the Dollhouse may also find something to love in Emily Skegg’s Patty, a wide-eyed suburban nerd whose life is turned upside down by the arrival of Simon (Kyle Gallner), a punk rock runaway. A throwback to the brightly coloured offbeat teen movies of the 90s and a rude riposte to that era’s more mainstream offerings (She’s All That’s sexist makeover scene is subverted), this sweet romcom is buoyed up by the chemistry between its leads. Tender moments, such as an original song penned by Patty, are tempered by the film’s abrasive and often scatological sense of humour.
Vanquish review – Ruby Rose slugs it out on a motorbike	With the superhero’s gentrification of the blockbuster business, there is little space any more for big-budget original action movies. So up-and-comers such as Ruby Rose – seen earlier this year opposite Jean Reno in The Doorman – are forced to slug it out in the B-movie arena, from where there’s no guarantee they’ll ever emerge into stardom. Rose looks great – her androgynous poise reminiscent of the young Angelina Jolie – and does a capable job carrying Vanquish. But you wonder if this noir-filtered, John Wick-apeing thriller is a little too stripped-back for its own good to advance her career. Rose plays Victoria, carer to Damon (Morgan Freeman), a wheelchair-bound retired cop whose ridiculously upscale mansion hints at off-the-books income. But she has a secret past, too: as a top drug courier in Berlin for the Russian mafia. So when Damon decides to call in money from his narcotics contacts, he forces Victoria to make the five stops necessary – and takes her daughter hostage as insurance. The alpha mama takes to her superbike for a whistlestop underworld tour, strapped up with a helmet and chestcam letting her blackmailer eyeball her rendezvous. Rose’s cartoonish assignations (some homeboys, a priest, a big-mouth mustachioed dealer in the mould of Alfred Molina in Boogie Nights), coupled with a scattering of plot morsels, give just enough narrative momentum to get Vanquish over the line. Director George Gallo is oddly relaxed about the finer details – such as how his heroine manages, held at gunpoint, to remove a hand grenade from her jacket, detonate it and escape unharmed – but he does have a talent for general ambience. Rose has an entrancingly tense entrance when she walks in on an African American gang as they watch an unlikely combination of curling and soft porn on giant screens. But the in-camera gimmick, with Freeman literally phoning it in on Rose’s headset, lends a strangely passive, vicarious overlay to much of the action – which is not particularly well-marshalled. There is no John Wick-style long-take high-wire act here – it’s simpler just to make Rose so deadly she never misses a headshot. Speaking of careers, this listless fodder is not where you’d have predicted Gallo, writer of 80s masterpiece Midnight Run, to end up. • Vanquish is available online on 28 May.
Flashback review – confusing but compelling multiverse thriller	If Slaughterhouse-Five and Donnie Darko had a baby, and that baby grew up in the 2000s, became a teenager and then developed a bit of a substance abuse problem, went partying with Denis Villeneuve’s Enemy and that Ashton Kutcher movie The Butterfly Effect, developed memory loss and depression, then it might look something like this interesting but rather muddled Canadian science fiction film. Dylan O’Brien, an actor in his late 20s who is fortuitously baby-faced enough to be cast as a high-school senior, stars as Fred, a guy who seems to have come a bit unstuck in time. At first, things seem normal as he goes about his life as an IT office drone, working under tough boss Evelyn (Amanda Brugel, looking more glam here than she usually does in The Handmaid’s Tale) and living with his nice but somewhat dull partner Karen (Hannah Gross). But the increasing dementia of his mother (Liisa Repo-Martell) and memories triggered by old photographs gets Fred thinking about his wild teenage years. Back then, Fred and his buddies did a faddish drug called Mercury, and Fred was crushing on an emo girl named Cindy (Maika Monroe from It Follows) who sat in front of him in maths class. But what seem at first like, per the film’s title, flashbacks turn out to be moments Fred is living in simultaneously. Or maybe they are another type of flashback: hallucinations induced by Mercury. Either way, these visual fragments start to piece together, quite literally, in a near-blur of superfast edits and the nature of Fred’s reality becomes a little clearer. Some viewers may need a second screening or more to work out what the hell is actually going on, especially with the EDM playing in the background in some scenes. Nevertheless, this pulpy multiverse brain-teaser is reasonably compelling to watch – at least in this reality. In another, it’s straight to video garbage, and in yet another, it’s won the Palme d’Or. • Flashback is released on 4 June on digital platforms.
Brighton review – Steven Berkoff’s dated seaside satire is a washout	The subject of this four-hander by the seaside is the changing face of Britishness. But Stephen Cookson’s film, adapted from Steven Berkoff’s 1994 play Brighton Beach Scumbags, is marooned in a weird cultural no man’s land. Maybe its four characters – Dinah and Derek, Dave and Doreen, a brace of ageing teddy boy/girl couples on a potty-mouthed nostalgia trip to the town where they met – qualified as bleeding-edge social satire in the 90s. But in an age of inquisitional identity politics, railing against “Pakis” and “poofters”, they stand out as cancellation candidates. Even for 2005, the year to which the film is updated, it seems archaic. It’s an awkward compromise, but setting it in the present day would have meant a heavy rewrite to make these throwbacks the Ukip voters they surely would be. Brighton takes place largely in a set of deckchairs on the seafront, like a Beryl Cook painting come to life. As the diehards chow down on burgers in closeup, Cookson lets us gorge on reams of heavily salted cockney dialogue. This grotesquerie is undeniably a great British tradition – but it’s hard to know who would revel in these caricatures today. Not fully updated in the light of 21st-century Britain, lacking the deadly irony with which Mike Leigh often shivs his characters, they feel like sour relics, even post-Brexit. The film tries to distance itself from their fag-toting antediluvianism with a couple of unconvincing plot twists. It comes over as too little too late, after indulging them for over an hour. Apart from the 60s flashbacks and the odd cutaway to a glittering English Channel, Cookson does little to disguise Brighton’s stage origins. At least, given this inertness, it is strongly performed by the four stalwarts. Larry Lamb – once of the EastEnders parish – plays Derek with an eroded remnant of his teddy quiff; a gammon-visaged Phil Davis is the butt of everyone’s jokes as Dave; Marion Bailey bustles terrifically through Dinah’s anxiety; and Lesley Sharp’s Doreen is the one character permitted real depth. The four Ds get their trailer moment with an impromptu waltz to I’m Forever Blowing Bubbles. It’s that kind of carry-on. • Brighton is released on digital platforms on 7 June.
I Am Samuel review – meditative, optimistic documentary on queer love in Kenya 	Filmed over five years, this documentary, directed by Peter Murimi, opens on a striking note that contrasts intimacy with cruelty. A date between Sam, the film’s subject, and his boyfriend Alex is juxtaposed with the brutal footage of a violent attack on one of Murimi’s own friends. Witnessing the tender connection between the couple in a society where people in such relationships can undergo physical harm as well as legal punishment affirms the courageous, moving joy of queer love and the bravery of the men who participate in the documentary. Having grown up in a small Kenyan village, Sam struggles with his sexuality until he moves to Nairobi, where he finds romance and acceptance. The bustling city might seem claustrophobic, with its rows of cramped apartments, yet introspective moments, captured by shots of laundry hung on balconies, gently rustling in the wind, offer breathing spaces. Back on the farm, Sam’s traditional, religious parents – his taciturn father is a Christian preacher – welcome Alex’s visits but still nudge their son to get married. The dynamic shifts when Sam finally comes out to his family. Sam is quiet on screen, so this film focuses on the rhythm of his private life: small gestures, such as when he kneads dough to make flatbreads or removes the kernels from his parents’ corn. This subdued approach poignantly conveys resilience; a harrowing attack aimed at Sam (and suffered by his roommate) is recalled by the victim in a matter-of-fact way. The fact that Murimi doesn’t sensationalise acts of discrimination only emphasises how painfully commonplace violence is in Kenya, but also suggests how queer solidarity and support are a crucial part of that same reality. The film is perhaps over compact, but its ending is heartwarmingly optimistic. • I Am Samuel is digital platforms from 3 June.
Caveat review – give that creepy mechanical bunny a Bafta!	This first feature from writer-director-editor Damian McCarthy sounds like it’s been assembled from off-the-shelf horror movie components: a protagonist with amnesia, missing people, a maybe-haunted house on an island (with a basement!), a creepy toy animal, and flashbacks that require the viewer to keep track of hairstyles and beard lengths to tell where we are in the timeline. But McCarthy plays a fancy cinematic game of hide the lady, swishing the narrative cards around adeptly and finding fresh ways to imbue the material with an incrementally increasing sense of unease. Props are particularly due to the props department, or whoever was responsible for the design of the mechanical drumming rabbit toy that plays a key role – a creature with human-looking glass eyes that glare out from a beetled brow with a calibrated expression of wariness, aggression and complicity. Give that bunny a Bafta! Its co-star is Jonathan French, who plays Isaac, an amnesiac young man with an impressive red beard, hired by a stranger named Barret (Ben Caplan) to “babysit” his niece. This is Olga (Leila Sykes), a young woman prone to fits of catatonia and running off to stay in the house where her father, Barret’s brother, killed himself some time ago, not long after his wife went missing. Most people would be wary of any job offer, no matter how remunerative, under just those conditions, but the weirdest part is that Isaac has to wear a leather harness, attached by lock and key to a long chain anchored in the basement, because Olga, when not in a catatonic state, is terrified of men. Nevertheless, Isaac takes the job, and soon finds himself clanking about the building, peeping through roughly sawn holes in the wall, his face lit like Anthony Perkins in Psycho, and being freaked out by a painting that keeps falling down and changing its image when he’s not looking. The painting could be a metonym for the film itself, which seems to shapeshift under the viewer’s gaze. The effect is both modern in its oblique surrealism but also reminiscent of silent cinema. The final endgame is a little unsatisfying, but this is a very interesting debut for McCarthy. • Caveat is released on 3 June on Shudder.
Safe Inside review – a flawed thriller with a doozy of a twist	Ana (Andrea Tivadar) and her boyfriend Tom (Tom Ainsley) are Americans travelling around Europe, who take a coach to a rural part of France where they expect to do farm work for a landowner, Richard (Steven Brand). The coach is involved in an accident, and when the two wake up everyone is gone, so they walk the rest of the way to Richard’s mansion. But Tom doesn’t get on so well with the landlord, and there’s something weird about the books in the house and records on the shelves. Everything is just a tiny bit skewwhiff in this intriguing but flawed thriller, starting with the fact that although it’s supposed to be set somewhere near Provence’s lavender fields and about two Yanks, director Renata Gabryjelska is Polish, Tivadar is British-Romanian, and the rest of the actors are mostly either Brits or Poles trying to sound French. Apart, that is, from the magnificent Joanna Kulig, star of Paweł Pawlikowski’s Cold War, who is largely wasted in a small role here. It was actually shot in Poland, which is why the architecture doesn’t look much like France at all. But it turns out everything makes sense in a way when the big twist kicks in, a real doozy that would be unfair to spoil. Unfortunately, that makes it very tricky to explain why the film doesn’t quite work. Basically, let’s say that the science part, on which the twist depends, is very tenuous indeed. And the script, by Błażej Dzikowski, based on an idea by Gabryjelska, isn’t nimble enough to dance around these core implausibilities. At least the cast is toothsome and pleasant to watch, especially Tivadar. • Safe Inside is released on 7 June on digital platforms.
Knots: A Forced Marriage Story review – bleak overview of marital coercion in America	There’s no rosy nostalgia to the wedding photos featured in Knots: A Forced Marriage Story, a 75-minute documentary written and directed by Kate Ryan Brewer that calls attention to the disturbingly few barriers against coerced marriage in the US. In succinct and gnawing first-person interviews, three women detail how intense parental pressure, teenage gullibility and isolation forced them into marriage with people they barely knew. There’s Nina van Harn, raised in the fundamentalist Christian patriarchy movement in rural western Michigan and married at 19 to a man selected by her father; Sara Tasneem, married at 15 to a 28-year-old stranger by her father; and Fraidy Reiss, paired by an Orthodox Jewish matchmaker in Brooklyn at 19. Along with the three women’s personal testimonies of coercion, confusion, shattered breaking points and eventual escape (all through arduous divorce proceedings), Knots weaves in bits of legal and historical context for a deeply troubling portrait of archaic marriage laws in the US. As the film points out, 48 states allow marriage for those under 18 through various exceptions, while 13 states have no age minimums for marriage at all. It’s a bleak picture, enhanced by Miriam Mayer’s spare, ominous score and recurring shots of a stirring dance performance by Bella Waru. Both gesture to the desperation, fear and anguish felt by the narrators, especially in regards to sexual trauma, which is referred to openly but not discussed in great detail. The spectre of coerced consummation is harrowing enough; Sara, at 15, was so unaware of what marriage entailed that she remembers asking her adult escorts to the wedding where she’d be sleeping that night. Knots is a straightforward advocacy film, and that’s fine: you don’t need cinematic bells and whistles to marvel at the women’s astounding resilience, or writhe at the gaslighting lines about honour, duty, and respect they were fed for years. There’s little faith to be found in the US political system, which has been slow to enact child marriage protections, but Knots offers three testaments to the human spirit, and the ability to start anew. • Knots: A Forced Marriage Story is released on 4 June on digital platforms.
Felix and the Hidden Treasure – family animation flounders as satire	This is a semi-entertaining, reasonably decent family animation that begins promisingly with a swell of adventure as a young boy sets sail in a boat in search of his missing dad. But after a couple of hastily resolved peril-at-sea moments (“We’re done for! We’re saved!”) the script lurches into a bizarrely un-childfriendly storyline about a secretive cult. The boy is 12-year-old Felix (nicely voiced by Daniel Brochu), who lives in Quebec’s Magdalen Islands with his mum and little sister. Two years earlier, his fisherman dad was lost at sea. Any hope that he might be alive is long gone, but Felix is determined to search the island where he was last spotted. He ropes in grumpy lighthouse-keeper Tom to help – a real old Captain Birdseye with a bushy beard and eyebrows like furry white caterpillars. There are some gracefully animated scenes as the pair sail off, all glowing sunsets and churning waves. But when they get shipwrecked, it all goes headspinningly wrong. They discover that an evil cult has built an underground city on the island where Felix’s dad went missing. The group’s leader Morgäa (Karine Vanasse), a woman with flicky, over-the-top Real Housewives hair and bling sunglasses, rejects the label “cult”. “The residents come here entirely of their own accord,” she trills. “They’ve adopted a peaceful, sincere lifestyle based on principles of harmony.” This satire of lifestyle gurus here is pretty low on gags, and it’s hard to see how it will connect with younger viewers. The rest of the movie plays out in standard kids’ entertainment frantic mode, the group’s security beefcakes chasing Felix and Tom around, everyone bopping each other on the head. Spoiler alert: Morgäa’s power is linked to immortality; adults get turned into babies, kids are threatened with premature ageing. It’s a neat idea, but the script doesn’t take it anywhere interesting. • Felix and the Hidden Treasure is released on 4 June in cinemas.
Lupin III: The First review – spectacular return for the legendary gentleman thief	Lupin, the legendary gentleman thief who jumped from the pages of the original Monkey Punch manga to numerous animated features and TV series, not to mention music CDs and video games, returns to the screen in the first iteration of the character in CG animation. This is a family-friendly interpretation from writer/director Takashi Yamazaki, sidestepping the raunchiness of some other adaptations, though retaining a heroic, cheeky and charming flair. This time around, the adventure of the daredevil thief is a little thin in terms of plot, yet dazzling in its execution. A decade after the end of the second world war, Lupin attempts to steal a diary containing secret inventions that caused its owner, the famous archeologist Bresson, to be shot dead by Nazis. During his quest, Lupin crosses path with Laetitia, an archeology student who is after the treasured item on behalf of her adopted grandfather; she is unaware that the latter is a Nazi sympathiser. When her eyes are opened to the old man’s nefarious intentions, she joins forces with Lupin and his sidekicks Jigen and Goemon, to stop the evil Nazis from securing Bresson’s all-powerful machine. As the film leaps across numerous continents, the gorgeous animation is on full display, capturing the striking hues of dusk hitting the Parisian rooftops as brilliantly as the sandy highlands in Mexico. Lupin III: The First stays true to the spirit of earlier anime renditions while showcasing the distinctive 3D look of CG animation; the spectacular sequence where Lupin zips through deadly laser rays while Yuji Ohno’s classic theme jazzily swells will impress even the most ardent of fans. Forgettable story aside, the film is a visual treat, full of joy and zaniness. • Lupin III: The First is released on 2 June in cinemas.
Jodie Foster gets honorary Palme d’Or from Cannes film festival	Jodie Foster is to be awarded an honorary Palme d’Or by the Cannes film festival. Foster, who has won two Oscars for best actress (for The Accused and The Silence of the Lambs), will also be the festival’s guest of honour at its opening ceremony on 6 July. She first attended Cannes as a 13-year-old in 1976 as a cast member of Taxi Driver, which went on to win the Palme d’Or. Her third film as director, The Beaver, was screened out of competition at the festival in 2011, as was her 2016 thriller Money Monster. Foster said: “Cannes is a festival to which I owe so much, it has completely changed my life. Although I had directed before, my first time on the Croisette was a defining moment for me. Showcasing one of my films here has always been a dream … Cannes is a festival by auteur film-makers who honour artists.” Festival president Pierre Lescure said: “Jodie Foster has provided us with an amazing gift by coming to celebrate the return of the festival on the Croisette.” Cannes general delegate Thierry Frémaux added: “Jodie never ceases to reinvent herself. She questions with her piercing gaze, learns from others, and is willing to step back from her beliefs in order to forge new morals.” Lescure and Frémaux are due to announce the festival’s lineup on 3 June after a series of delays to the event caused by the Covid pandemic. It is scheduled to go ahead in July, but new travel regulations brought in by the French government may prevent delegates from the UK from attending.
Life in a Year review – Cara Delevingne and Jaden Smith in vacuous cancer weepie	“I don’t believe in happy endings,” Cara Delevingne shouts at Jaden Smith in this gushing, sobfest cancer romance. She plays Izzy, a Pittsburgh teenager diagnosed with stage three ovarian cancer and given less than a year to live. Izzy is a character you might recognise from other movies: the pretty cancer-patient girlfriend. Her job here is to be life-affirmingly brave and then die (tastefully), thus enriching her boyfriend Daryn (Smith) with a tragic yet alluring backstory. Which is a shame, because Delevingne gives an impressive performance; not convincing exactly, but likable and charismatic. And to be fair, Izzy is a paper-thin character – on paper, she must have looked like a collection of cliches. Izzy grows up on the wrong side of town, raised from the age of six by the babysitter after her drug-addict mum walked out. She’s tattooed and tough on the outside, with blue hair, and a sweet-natured and courageous soul. Smith, on the other hand, is a tad bland as rich kid Daryn, an outstanding student being groomed for greatness by his dad (Cuba Gooding Jr). Secretly, Daryn dreams of becoming a rapper; and here’s where Izzy comes in useful with her grab-life-while-you-can dying-girl wisdom. The pair meet when they both gatecrash a rap gig. Izzy nicknames Daryn “Square”. The blue hair turns out to be a wig: she lost her hair during chemo. When he finds out she’s dying, Daryn decides to cram a lifetime of milestones into their short year together. The upbeat montages of the two seizing the day and the slo-mo panic dashes to A&amp;E feel like scenes shuffled from a dozen terminal-illness weepies. Depressingly, Izzy seems to have absolutely no friends or dreams of her own. Nothing here is real-world or complicated – though there are a couple of conspicuous attempts: in one scene, Smith dons a pair of rubber gloves to wash a bedpan. It’s a fairytale high on teenage narcissism: parents are either absent or eventually humbled by their wise-hearted offspring. Still, as these films always do, it gets you in the end with a left hook to the tear ducts. I was genuinely seething at being manipulated by such mawkish baloney. • Life in a Year is released on 7 June on digital platforms.
The Killing of Two Lovers review – a riveting portrait of male rage	Pain and rage pulse through this superbly made drama about marital breakdown and male humiliation. The tension is cranked up in its shocking first scene, which works cleverly in tandem with the title, but writer-director Robert Machoian is asking us: which two lovers does that mean, exactly? And what should we make of the very last scene? Does it show us acceptance, despair, or both? David, played by Clayne Crawford, is a married guy in small-town Utah who had dreams of being a singer-songwriter but now does odd jobs; he is separated from his wife Nikki (Sepideh Moafi), a high-flying lawyer, and their four young children. The couple have apparently agreed that she should have the large family house because the children are happier there with her, so David gets to live like a superannuated kid with his ailing widower dad in his ramshackle childhood home nearby. With elaborate formalised courtesy, David and Nikki have agreed that they are “working things out” and “can see other people”, but David is very much aware that it is only Nikki who is seeing someone else: fellow lawyer Derek (Chris Coy), who gets to stay over with the kids in the house. David only wants to get back together, and his rebellious eldest daughter Jess (Avery Pizzuto) hates Derek, hates Nikki, and most of all hates David for being a “loser dad” and accepting it all so meekly. It is having to explain himself to Jess, having to say out loud that he is a pathetic beta male who won’t fight for his family – a mortification he is willing to accept for the sake of children who may actually grow up to despise him – which plants the seed of violence. For all that we might sympathise with the woeful David, who knows how much he was originally at fault? And how much has Derek been told about it? Machoian, who is also the editor, composes each scene with studied care and Oscar Ignacio Jiménez’s clear, crisp cinematography and framing is beautifully achieved. This is a compelling portrait of a toxic marriage. • The Killing of Two Lovers is released on 4 June in cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema.
John Boyega exits Netflix movie mid-shoot for ‘family reasons’	Actor John Boyega has left the Netflix thriller Rebel Ridge mid-shoot because of “family reasons”. According to Deadline, the Small Axe star, who recently won a Golden Globe for his performance in the acclaimed series, has exited the project and will not be returning. Filming started at the beginning of May. “Rebel Ridge is pausing temporarily as we look to re-cast John Boyega who needed to leave the project for family reasons,” a spokesperson told Deadline. “We remain committed to Jeremy Saulnier’s extraordinary film and look forward to resuming production. We look forward to continuing our partnership with John Boyega’s UpperRoom Productions, in addition to our upcoming film They Cloned Tyrone in which he also stars.” Boyega was set to lead the film, from the Green Room director Jeremy Saulnier, which was originally set to shoot in April 2020 until the Covid-19 pandemic. It’s described as “a high-velocity thriller that explores systemic American injustices through intense action sequences, suspense and dark humor”. The remaining cast includes Don Johnson, AnnaSophia Robb, James Cromwell and Emory Cohen. Saulnier broke out with revenge thriller Blue Ruin in 2013. Boyega recently completed the sci-fi comedy They Cloned Tyrone for Netflix, starring alongside Jamie Foxx, Teyonah Parris and Brian Tyree Henry and will next be seen in legal thriller Naked Singularity. It was also recently announced that he will return for a sequel to Attack the Block, the hit adventure that first made him a star. “Yes Attack the Block 2 is happening!” he wrote on Instagram. “Yes I’ll be starring and producing! Yes I’m bloody excited ! London VS them tings.” Further details on Boyega’s departure are as yet unknown.
Gunda review – snuffling about in the secret life of pigs	The secret life of farm animals remains a secret, but a fascinating and even poignant one, in this strange and unexpectedly subtle film from the Russian documentary-maker Viktor Kossakovsky, whose last movie, Aquarela, was a disturbing meditation on the climate crisis. It’s an extended, black-and-white study of a farmyard sow whose name is presumably Gunda, although the humans who would have given her this name are never shown. There are no people. No dialogue. Just animals. The camera follows this sow around the farm, just after farrowing, and we see the tiny piglets suckling; and later these same piglets, much bigger, still suckling and jostling. We also see the sow’s fellow beasts, including a one-legged chicken and some cows who are shown running in slo-mo – the film’s one bit of over-aestheticisation, which is a misjudgment. Are they all living on the farm together? Maybe not. A closing note on the credits reveals that this was filmed on farms and sanctuaries in Norway, Spain and the UK. Kossakovsky has crafted a fiction, to some extent. (And who knows, maybe the ambient farmyard sounds have also been cheated.) But the film shows something interesting: simply by closing in on the pig’s eyes, it insists on something uncanny. Gunda’s eyes look haunted and sad. The cow’s eyes, on the other hand, seem cold and haughty. Anthropomorphism? Yes, of course. But there is a painful and even tragic meaning that is hidden everywhere on the farm: all these animals are bred to be used and killed and Kossakovsky enigmatically keeps his camera on Gunda after her piglets are finally taken away from her. Gunda seems confused, disoriented, perhaps even stunned. But there is no emotional history here, no emotional affect. The animal just keeps on existing. Gunda has something in common with brutally revelatory documentaries such as Georges Franju’s Blood of the Beasts or Nikolaus Geyrhalter’s Our Daily Bread, which showed the reality of animal slaughter. This shows the weird, blank emptiness that surrounds animals when the fact of slaughter is just out of shot, the empty waiting that precedes the main event. • Gunda is released in cinemas on 4 June.
Dream Horse review – true story of a Welsh village that bought a racehorse is a winner	Six years ago I found myself gripped by the overwhelmingly likable documentary Dark Horse, which told the amazing true story of Janet Vokes, a former whippet breeder and pigeon fancier from the depressed Welsh village of Cefn Fforest who organised a community syndicate to buy a racehorse. The drinkers at Jan’s local chipped in a weekly £10 sub and their horse, symbolically called Dream Alliance, wound up winning the Welsh Grand National, basically making it the Seabiscuit of the valleys. I predicted at the time that this would be remade as a fiction feature with Imelda Staunton as Jan and Jim Broadbent as her hangdog husband Brian. Well, actually it’s Toni Collette and Owen Teale, with Damian Lewis playing Howard Davies, the local tax accountant and breezy man-of-the-world whose dangerously addictive love of horseracing inspires Jan. The resulting movie may be a bit schmaltzy – actually, a lot schmaltzy – but I couldn’t help enjoying it: like Chariots of Fire, only with horses. That comparison, however, may be down to Chariots cast member Nicholas Farrell here playing the shrewd professional trainer Philip Hobbs. This movie gets a real gallop on, due to the sheer warmth of its performances. Collette, that perennially excellent actor who utterly inhabits every part, gives us a wonderfully approachable Jan: shy, yet tough and determined. Lewis is robust and yet very sympathetic as the rakish Howard who has come very close in the past to losing his shirt to the sport of kings. And it is a treat to see Joanna Page as Howard’s wife Angela and a cameo for Siân Phillips as Maureen, a local woman with a passion for Tunnock’s Tea Cakes. My only slight quibble is that the film’s title, Dream Horse, sounds like something chosen by an algorithm. Why not stick with Dark Horse? Well, no matter. It’s a winner. • Dream Horse is released on 4 June in cinemas.
Anthony Bourdain: trailer released for Oscar-tipped documentary Roadrunner	Roadrunner, a new documentary examining the life, death and legacy of Anthony Bourdain, has released a first trailer. The film, which is directed by Oscar-winner Morgan Neville, splices unseen and archive footage of the much-loved chef, author and TV star with new talking-head interviews from those close to him. Bourdain’s own voiceover is used, so he appears to narrate his own story. Bourdain killed himself aged 61 in June 2018 while in France shooting a TV show, and the film suggests he may have found it difficult to speak to people about his mental health. Neville’s previous work includes 2018’s Won’t You Be My Neighbour?, an affecting look at the life of children’s TV icon Fred Rogers, which became the top-grossing biographical documentary ever produced. He also won an Oscar for his 2013 study of backing singers, 20 Feet from Stardom. In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

Tom Cruise’s Mission: Impossible 7 production temporarily shut down due to coronavirus case	Paramount Pictures has temporarily shut down production on the British set of Tom Cruise’s seventh Mission: Impossible film after someone tested positive for coronavirus. “We have temporarily halted production on Mission: Impossible 7 until June 14th, due to positive coronavirus test results during routine testing,” a Paramount spokesperson said on Thursday. “We are following all safety protocols and will continue to monitor the situation.” The company provided no further details. In December, Cruise launched an expletive-laden rant at colleagues on the Mission: Impossible set, after apparent breaches of on-set social distancing guidelines. In an audio recording released by The Sun, Cruise can be heard shouting and swearing at film crew on the project, of which is he one of the producers, warning that anyone caught not following the rules to stay at least 2m (more than 6.5 feet) away from others will be instantly dismissed. On the recording Cruise can be heard shouting: “I don’t ever want to see it again, ever! And if you don’t do it, you’re fired, if I see you do it again, you’re fucking gone. And if anyone in this crew does it – that’s it, and you too and you too … don’t you ever fucking do it again.” “That’s it! No apologies. You can tell it to the people that are losing their fucking homes because our industry is shut down. It’s not going to put food on their table or pay for their college education.” The film, which paused production for months early last year along with the rest of the film industry when the coronavirus pandemic took hold, is scheduled to be released in 2022. • Associated Press contributed to this report
A Quiet Place Part II review – slick horror sequel	John Krasinski’s slick, skilful follow-up to his 2018 post-apocalyptic thriller works well as a genre exercise; with patriarch Lee (Krasinski) sacrificed to the first film, Evelyn (Emily Blunt, Krasinski’s real-life partner) and her three children must once again outwit an army of aliens with exceptional hearing. The brains behind the operation is the hearing-impaired Regan (Millicent Simmonds), who is teamed up with reluctant protector Emmett (Cillian Murphy) while Noah Jupe’s nervy little brother tends to the family’s newborn. To suggest Krasinski is only interested in surface thrills feels at odds with the seriousness of his craft. Judicious pacing, clever cross-cutting and visceral sound design build tension, but there’s an absence of soul, and no satisfying sense of what the monsters might be a metaphor for.
Ahead of the Curve review – in praise of the pioneering lesbian magazine	This fervently supportive documentary about the iconic lesbian magazine Curve and its founder-publisher Frances “Franco” Stevens is directed by Stevens’s wife, Jen Rainin, and it’s both energised and hindered by her preaching-to-the-choir approach. Stevens was a San Francisco woman who in the 1980s got married young, came out as lesbian, was shunned by her family and briefly became homeless. In 1990, she launched what was then called Deneuve magazine by maxing out a handful of brand new credit cards, betting everything at the horse races – and winning big. It’s a staggering story, virtually the American dream in action, especially as Deneuve went from strength to strength, with celebrity interviews, national ads and rocketing circulation. Stevens had the courage and vision to put the word “lesbian” on the cover, and gay women responded passionately to her mission to bring them visibility. In 1995, French movie star Catherine Deneuve sued the magazine for trademark infringement, after which it changed its name to Curve. Actually, Stevens has always denied that that it was named after Catherine Deneuve, and a brisker-minded documentary with more objective journalistic nous might have pressed her harder on this and other points, and tried interviewing Deneuve herself. Stevens became disabled after an accident two years later, and the stress led her to sell the magazine to another publisher; she was forced to look on aghast from the sidelines as her creation (like all print publications) struggled in the digital age. But even more seriously, the new Curve removed the word “lesbian” from the front cover because it was perceived as exclusionary by younger generations of queer women. Stevens had campaigned so fiercely against the erasure of lesbianism. So how does she feel about that? This film never really tackles such difficult questions, but it’s a valuable portrait of a great risk-taker. • Ahead of the Curve is released on 4 June in cinemas and on digital platforms.
Gunda review – immersive pig’s-eye view	A sow and her litter of adorable piglets are the subject of this memorable documentary from Russian director Viktor Kosakovskiy (Aquarela), executive produced by Joaquin Phoenix. Kosakovskiy doesn’t attempt to assume the point of view of the pigs, but for 90 minutes he lives among them, his camera taking up residence inside their barn and roaming their pasture at eye level. He also visits and observes their neighbours, including a tentative flock of chickens and a herd of stoic dairy cows. There is no narration, no subtitles and no musical score but, instead, an immersive soundscape of farmyard grunts and squelches. To call the film meditative would be to undersell Kosakovskiy’s instinct for drama and tension. The director gravitates towards runts and stragglers, such as a piglet buried beneath a pile of hay and unceremoniously crushed by its mother. A one-legged chicken is treated with similar reverence. The crisp black and white digital cinematography emphasises the piglets’ downy fur, sleepy eyes and softly rising bellies. It’s an encouragement to acknowledge the beauty, texture and aliveness of the animals. Less successful is the invitation to project interiority on to the creatures’ inscrutable faces – the way the camera fixes on a cow’s intense stare, for example, feels like a call to imbue its gaze with emotional significance.
The Killing of Two Lovers review – heartbreaking separation drama	A striking opening scene sees David (Clayne Crawford) pointing a gun at his sleeping wife. Whether or not he’ll snap hangs over the remainder of this lean, stylish and frequently heartbreaking drama set in rural Utah, against a backdrop of Parma Violet skies. Crawford is brilliant and bitter as a soon-to-be divorced dad unable to accept his fate. The recurring sound of a car door slamming haunts the film, the ghost of a car-bound confrontation between David and Nikki (Sepideh Moafi). Though they are oceans apart emotionally, the scene plays out entirely in closeup. • In cinemas and exclusively on Curzon Home Cinema
Dream Horse review – hope and hwyl in a one-horse town	“£300? Could’ve gone to Benidorm for that,” scoffs Brian (Owen Teale). His overworked and underappreciated wife, Jan (Toni Collette, luminous and easy to root for), has spent 300 quid on a mare with a syndicate of locals, hoping to breed a racehorse to compete with the best. It’s a wise investment, as Dream Alliance turns out to be a winner and a symbol of hope in Cefn Fforest, an economically depressed former mining village in Wales. But they’re not doing it for the money – it’s for the “hwyl”, a Welsh word meaning “emotional motivation and energy”. With its hero’s journey structure, punchily edited racing scenes and warmly drawn oddball community (a widow, Maureen, is obsessed with Tunnock’s Tea Cakes), the film is shamelessly predictable and thoroughly feelgood.
Land review – Robin Wright goes mild in the country	Edee (Robin Wright, who also directs) ditches her phone, abandons her car, and isolates herself in a remote cabin in Wyoming, attempting to bury her grief in the mountains. Except she’s woefully unprepared, unable to chop wood or read a compass, never mind catch and kill her own food. “This isn’t working,” she screams in frustration, and so the film wisely changes tack halfway through, shifting from survivalist drama into melodrama. Edee is rescued by Miguel (Demián Bichir), a handsome man in a cowboy hat who gently brings her back to life with quiet companionship, hunting lessons, and Tears for Fears karaoke. “Only a person who has never been hungry would think starving is a way to die,” says Miguel, gently prodding at Edee’s privilege (and putting the film in conversation with others in which educated, unhappy white people pursue minimalist living – think Nomadland, Wild, Into the Wild). Wright is sympathetic and believable, but we never truly get a sense of Edee or her desires outside the bounds of her loss.
Carey Mulligan and Zoe Kazan to star as reporters who exposed Weinstein	Carey Mulligan and Zoe Kazan are set to take on the roles of the reporters who exposed Harvey Weinstein. In She Said, the pair will play Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor, the New York Times journalists whose landmark expose helped to bring down the movie mogul accused and ultimately convicted of sexual assault. The film is an adaptation of the pair’s bestselling book She Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story That Helped Ignite a Movement, which details their Pulitzer prize-winning work that exposed Weinstein as a predator. He was sentenced to 23 years in prison. The Guardian’s Helen Lewis praised the book as “a hymn to old-fashioned investigative reporting” comparing parts of it to All the President’s Men. The spirit of the adaptation is being likened both to the Watergate drama and the Oscar-winning Spotlight about a team of journalists investigating allegations of sexual abuse within the Catholic church. The Universal Pictures project will be directed by Maria Schrader, who recently won an Emmy for her work on the hit Netflix drama Unorthodox. The script will come from British playwright and screenwriter Rebecca Lenkiewicz whose big screen work includes Ida and Disobedience. The news comes after Mulligan received rave reviews and awards attention for her role in the revenge thriller Promising Young Woman. She is currently filming fact-based sci-fi drama Spaceman alongside Adam Sandler. Kazan, best known for her performance in The Big Sick, was most recently seen in HBO’s miniseries The Plot Against America. She is also set to star in social media-based drama series Clickbait with Adrian Grenier. Mulligan and Kazan have previously co-starred on stage in a Broadway production of The Seagull.
Parallel review – alternate reality thriller turns out deeply conventional	Arthur C Clarke once said that there are two possibilities. Either we are alone in the universe or we are not: both are terrifying. But the funny thing in this sci-fi thriller – about parallel universes rather than alien lifeforms – is quite how unterrified, or even awestruck, these four Seattle housemates are when a mirror in their attic turns out to be a portal to a “multiverse” of alternate realities. They barely pause to register the uncanny weirdness of bumping into versions of themselves. Nope, they move straight on to the important matter of making money. What they discover is that the parallel universes (or “alts” as they call them) tick along much like our world: same major events but with slight divergences, particularly in industries like art and tech. “Look, Mona Lisa’s hair is short!” exclaims Leena (Georgia King) flicking through an art book in an alt. (It’s perhaps best not to dwell on the logical impossibilities.) So, this mediocre bunch start stealing ideas from the alts and passing them off as their own – a shortcut to greatness. Ruthlessly ambitious Noel (Martin Wallström), fancying some Elon Musk-style world tech domination, pops behind the mirror to stock up on innovations by actual geniuses. Leena, a struggling artist, appropriates work by a leading painter in an alt and becomes an art world sensation, only to experience a wave of self-loathing. The ideas here present an interesting variation of traditional sci-fi themes from movies such as Groundhog Day, Primer and Flatliners. So it’s a shame that the script goes down the conventional thriller route: success tests the group’s friendships, and there are a couple of showdowns involving guns (neatly solved by the ease of disposing of bodies in other universes). It’s watchable, but don’t expect your mind to be blown – more gently prodded. • Parallel is released on 14 June on digital platforms.
Sunflowers review – an intricate portrait of Van Gogh’s iconic series	Not surprisingly, Vincent van Gogh has proved a rich seam for the Exhibition on Screen gallery series, with one of the most commercially potent of modern painters providing material for previous films including Van Gogh in Japan and Van Gogh: A New Way of Seeing. Here, the attention is even more micro, though hardly niche: the series of sunflower studies Van Gogh painted in 1888 and 1889, one of which went on to command a record auction price in the mid 1980s and practically on its own send the art market into the financial stratosphere. Super-familiar though the sunflower paintings may be, this film does a pretty good job of drilling down through the intricacies of the series, from Van Gogh’s earlier “Paris” set, and then the seven pictures he painted in Arles, which provide varying versions of the famous flower-vase arrangement. The film takes us carefully through each of the pictures, showing them in situ and giving the curators the chance to chat, rather like the epic Leonardo tour the same producers released in 2019. This film, though, has the chance to dwell a little longer, sketching in biographical information and offering readings from Van Gogh’s own letters to fill out the artist’s thinking. There’s also an interesting insight into the “competitive gardening” of the era, and the sunflower’s place in it: Oxford University’s Stephen Harris offers a more enthusiastic explainer than you normally get in films like this. Director-producer team David Bickerstaff and Phil Grabsky are past masters at putting this kind of film together, and Sunflowers has the usual mix of smoothly impressive visuals and authoritatively informed comment. The analysis focuses mostly on Van Gogh’s artistic and creative decisions; given that this was such a tumultuous period for his mental health (including the notorious ear-cutting incident after rowing with his houseguest Paul Gauguin), I would have liked to hear more on how it may or may not have fed into the work. Be that as it may, this is a good option for those who are not quite ready to brave the museum, and prefer to try a little cinema-based social distancing instead. • Sunflowers is released on 8 June in cinemas.
Me, Myself and Di review – miserably unfunny romcom about Bolton’s Bridget Jones	There’s nothing quite so naff and depressing as a British comedy misfire, and Me, Myself and Di is the real deal: a miserably unfunny romcom about Bolton’s answer to Bridget Jones. Her name is Janet Brown (Katy Clayton), and she is a chirpy 30-year-old virgin who works in a supermarket stacking shelves. Janet is devastated when an internet date stands her up: “He took one look at me and ran off because I’m fat and ugly,” she sobs. “You’re not ugly,” quips her glam best friend Diana (Lucy Pinder), always ready to knock Janet’s self-confidence. The world lays indignities upon Janet and then film throws on some more. The character is so thinly written that there’s little for Clayton to do other than perform her with a kind of mouth-open gormlessness. Most of the film is set at an annoyingly anachronistic holiday camp in Rhyl where the two friends go on holiday for a week. Diana gives Janet a makeover for the trip; transforming her into Jeanette De Brun (“It’s French, dead classy,” she reasons). The comedy here is meant to be affectionate social satire, I think. But it feels snidey: a mickey-take of working-class characters hilariously mispronouncing “Tenerife” and “Les Misérables”. Saying that, it’s pretty crass about the upper crust, too. You know as soon as inefficient toff John (Tyger Drew-Honey) stammers a “hello” that he’s Janet’s love interest. He’s on holiday with his cartoonishly snobbish mother (Jenny Funnell) and sister. The silly, kids’-TV-ish plotline here is that Janet maintains the fiction to John that she is wealthy, well-spoken Jeanette from “higher Bolton”. He sees through the act, of course, and loves her for who she really is. The whole thing is pretty hopeless but I did laugh at one gag, when Janet uses the loo in John’s static caravan. His mum calls after her: “No solids, mind deary.” • Me, Myself and Di is released on 11 June in cinemas.
Cannes: Joanna Hogg and Clio Barnard to premiere new films in Directors’ Fortnight	The Cannes film festival has announced more of its lineup with the selections for the Directors’ Fortnight, the separate strand that runs alongside the official festival and the Critics’ Week. Highlights of the Directors’ Fortnight include new films from British directors Joanna Hogg and Clio Barnard, an Italian documentary which includes Happy as Lazzaro’s Alice Rohrwacher among its three directors, and a new musical co-directed by musician-actor Saul Williams and Rwandan film-maker Anisia Uzeyman. Hogg will be premiering The Souvenir Part II, the follow-up to her loosely autobiographical 2019 drama The Souvenir, which like the first film will feature Honor Swinton Byrne in the lead role. Barnard, whose last film was the 2017 drama Dark River, and who is currently working on the Apple TV mini-series The Essex Serpent, is due to bring Ali &amp; Ava to Cannes; starring Adeel Akhtar and Claire Rushbrook, it is described as “a contemporary British love story that explores the intricacies of age, class and race”. Meanwhile Rohwacher, who won the best screenplay award at the 2018 Cannes film festival for Happy as Lazzaro, joins Pietro Marcello and Francesco Munzi for a documentary, Futura, billed as an examination of “the different expectations and prospects for the future” of Italian teenagers. Williams and Uzeyman have joined forces on Neptune’s Frost, which Williams described as “the love story between an inter-sex runaway, a coltan miner and the virtual marvel born as a result of their union”. Hogg and Barnard’s participation will provide some comfort for the British film industry, after no UK directors were selected for the official competition or the Critics’ Week lineup, the only British director already involved being Andrea Arnold, whose documentary Cow is showing in a new sidebar called Cannes Premieres. However, the Directors’ Fortnight selection has shown up the official selection’s continuing reluctance to select female film-makers. Twelve out of the Directors’ Fortnight’s 30 directors are women, while only four of out of the 24 directors competing for the Palme d’Or are female. The festival also recently announced it will screen the new Fast and Furious film, F9, in its French premiere, though it will have opened across most of the world by the end of June. The Cannes film festival is due to run from 6-17 July, after being delayed from its traditional mid-May calendar slot.
The Amusement Park review – George Romero’s absurdist nightmare on growing old	George Romero’s deeply odd, brief feature – an absurdist nightmare featuring silent-movie style melodrama acting – was made in 1973, long considered lost and now restored and rereleased. It was commissioned by the Lutheran Service Society, who were hoping for a film about the problems of growing old and the necessity of helping and respecting older people, and were reportedly upset by how Romero interpreted the brief. What he gave them was a very disquieting and upsetting fantasy about a distinguished, kindly old gentleman in a dapper white suit wandering around a crowded funfair, only to discover that the fair (like life itself) is for the young; the old people are there to be patronised, infantilised, bullied, ignored, robbed and terrorised. A mishap at a bumper car ride ends with a bizarre appearance by a traffic cop and an insurance agent who are all sure that the old person must be in the wrong. A sinister “see your future” sideshow tent astonishes a pair of young lovers by revealing to them their destiny as a poor, sick old married couple and the man is so enraged he assaults our white-clad hero – because he is old. A “freaks” display turns out to be a simple parade of old people. And so it goes on. The lead actor is Lincoln Maazel, who went on to star in Romero’s 1978 horror Martin (and was, incidentally, the father of the conductor Lorin Maazel); he gives a dignified and stately introduction to the film in the weirdly deserted fairground, and also a thoughtful coda just before the credits. These bookending sections show how this peculiar work was intended to function as something like British public information films on TV with their deeply disturbing little vignettes. Maazel earnestly tells the audience to get involved with volunteering organisations. But the important thing is to be disturbed. • The Amusement Park is released on 8 June on Shudder. • This article was amended on 9 June 2021 to remove text that stated incorrectly that The Amusement Park gives no information about getting involved with volunteering organisations.

Agony review – Asia Argento stars in atmospheric horror where house is the star	It might be something of a surprise to see a new movie starring Asia Argento, a leading figure in the #MeToo movement; Agony, directed by Argento’s ex-husband Michele Civetta, was actually completed in 2017. This atmospheric film hovers somewhere between a gothic horror and a giallo. Isidora (Argento) is a tightly wound Italian artist living in New York with her husband and young daughter. Plagued by strange visions of an occult ceremony, Isidora continues to unravel when she discovers that her mother, whom she believes is long dead, only passed away recently and has left her a vast estate in Tuscany. Isidora confronts her father, who confesses that he shielded her from the truth because of her mother’s debilitating mental illness. Isidora, along with her family, heads to the estate to oversee her mother’s funeral, and she is haunted by the image of a lady in red and begins to lose her grip on reality. It’s the old, mysterious mansion that emerges as the real star. Baroque fading wallpapers, ornate painted ceiling, the winding corridors and halls; they all carry whispers of secrets and generate a palpable sense of unease. The first half of the film is an especially impressive mood piece, contrasting the foggy, unknowable landscape with Isidora’s worsening psyche. Stellar support performances from Monica Guerritore, who plays the forbidding housekeeper Angelica, and veteran actor Franco Nero further enhance the conspiratorial atmosphere. Unfortunately, when Agony veers into the more explicitly horror territories, the garish colour effects cheapen the overall ambience. Poorly written dialogue also renders Isidora’s breakdown uninspired rather than moving. It’s a shame that, for all of its unnerving tonal registers, not to mention a gorgeous score, Agony winds up with a painfully predictable ending. • Agony is released on 14 June on digital platforms.
Brabham review – bumpy portrait of old-school F1 legend	This is a documentary about Australian motor sports legend Jack Brabham that aims to finesse the usual greatest-hits highlights by including some darker material: family strife, on-track bad behaviour, behind-the-scenes fallouts. Brabham remains best known for being the only Formula One driver to win the world title in a car of their own construction, and this profile makes much of his engineering skills and constant tinkering in the workshop. He also raced throughout the sport’s most dangerous era – see the jaw-dropping BBC documentary Grand Prix: The Killer Years – with apparently barely a scratch, though there are some amusing shots of Brabham being forced to push his car over the line after running out of fuel on a number of occasions. Things get more complicated in the second half of the film: Brabham’s racing style comes in for some veiled criticism for its “elbow’s out” quality, and he was apparently known for deliberately running over trackside gravel so stones would kick up into rival drivers’ faces. His relationship with longtime car designer Ron Tauranac, a key figure in Brabham’s racing success, was also fractious, with the pair falling out; despite this, Tauranac took over the Brabham racing marque until selling it on to Bernie Ecclestone. And two of Brabham’s sons, David and Geoff, both racers themselves, talk of their father as a distant, emotionally unavailable individual. (His third son, convicted child rapist Gary Brabham, appears to have been edited out of the story.) All this is accomplished via the customary stream of talking heads from the sport’s glory years, though the film-makers – perhaps attempting to bolster their take-no-prisoners credentials – have an odd tic of including unflattering interview outtakes, such as former McLaren CEO Ron Dennis moaning at someone behind him ruining the shot: it’s a device that belongs in less conventional films. • Brabham is released on 14 June on digital platforms.
Nobody review – bone-crunchingly enjoyable geri-action from Bob Odenkirk 	Geriatric action stars, like geriatric millennials, might be having a bit of a moment. Bob Odenkirk, better known as slippery lawyer Saul Goodman in TV’s Breaking Bad and its spin-off Better Call Saul, unexpectedly gets to bust out some serious fight moves at the age of 58. That’s two years older than Liam Neeson was when he made Taken, and eight years older than Keanu Reeves at the time of the first John Wick film, though Reeves admittedly already had the action chops. Nobody, from screenwriter Derek Kolstad (creator of John Wick) and the Russian action director Ilya Naishuller, gives us Odenkirk as a nobody: a boring guy called Hutch with two kids, who works at some dull machine tools plant, while his more glamorous wife Becca (Connie Nielsen) brings home more bacon as an estate agent. When a couple of armed punks break into his house one night, Hutch is humiliated by his failure to protect his family. But like Kenny Rogers’ Coward of the County, Hutch has a surprise in store for us. Something inside him snaps when he realises that the robbers took his daughter’s kitty bracelet, and it seems that there is something in his professional past that has not been made plain to us. Hutch goes on an undisciplined emotional rampage, and winds up fortuitously beating the living jeepers out of half a dozen Russian gangsters on a bus: an entertainingly gonzo sequence. But a serious Russian mobster wants revenge on Hutch and this is the granite-faced Yulian, played by Aleksey Serebryakov (whom devotees of a higher-brow sort of film might remember as the desolate car mechanic in Andrey Zvyagintsev’s Leviathan.) It has to be said that Nobody rattles enjoyably and bone-crunchingly along and as for Odenkirk, this career turn more or less pays off. He never tries to be macho exactly, and spends a lot of his time flinching and scowling at all the cuts and bruises on his face. But his fisticuffs and over-the-top weapons mayhem look plausible enough. As far as action stardom goes, Odenkirk might yet be somebody. • Nobody is released on 9 June in cinemas.
Shiva Baby review – black comedy is a festival of excruciating embarrassment	This debut feature from 25-year-old writer-director Emma Seligman is an amusing, self-aware, indulgent and transparently personal chamber piece, developed from an earlier short she submitted as her NYU thesis film. It could have been partly inspired by the party scene at the beginning of The Graduate, the one where smug oldsters tell Dustin Hoffman’s character he should be getting into plastics. Actor and online comic Rachel Sennott plays Danielle, aimlessly out of college and picking up cash with what she tells her parents is a regular “babysitting” gig; one day she shows up with them at a shiva (that is, the Jewish observance not dissimilar to a wake) expecting to endure only the usual questioning from relatives about why she is so thin, why she doesn’t have a boyfriend and what she’s going to do with her life. But to her horror she sees Max (Danny Deferrari), the wealthy married man with whom she has been having sex for money. Max, though venal and smugly exploitative, had also been becoming increasingly tender towards Danielle, believing her story that she needs cash for grad school. He too is aghast at their unexpected meeting in this unsexy setting: she is a very different, subdued, schoolgirlish and slightly brattish figure, from whose tutting relatives he indirectly learns that the grad school story is nonsense, and she has no plans, nor any pressing need for money, because her adoring parents (Fred Melamed and Polly Draper) are picking up every tab. To add to this festival of excruciating embarrassment, Danielle sees Maya (Molly Gordon), a young woman she once semi-officially dated, and with whom she may still be in love. This is a very intense, claustrophobic black comedy whose inner anxiety is underlined by Ariel Marx’s nerve-jangling score, which seems always to be leading us to some eruption of emotional hurt. And, in fact, there are two or three moments where the buzz of conversation is suddenly stilled by the raising of voices. The film is maybe a little callow, but it’s an undoubtedly impressive and accomplished debut. • Shiva Baby is released on 9 June in cinemas and on 11 June on Mubi.
Lin-Manuel Miranda’s In the Heights could boost movie theaters’ recovery	The eagerly awaited Lin-Manuel Miranda movie In the Heights has arrived with enthusiastic fans headed to theaters and HBO Max on Thursday and through the weekend. The film, which centers on a group of Latino characters in the Washington Heights neighborhood of New York City, has received largely positive reviews, and signs are that it is set to reel in big audiences, following a slew of other popular releases such as A Quiet Place Part 2 and Godzilla vs Kong hoping to draw people back to theaters this summer. In a poll of 1,300 moviegoers by the ticketing company Fandango, 96% of responders said In the Heights, which follows Miranda’s successful Broadway musical, would be the first film they go to post-pandemic, while the Jon M Chu-directed film is the top-selling show for this Friday and Saturday. If the film can turn out viewers, it will be a boost for an industry hit hard by the pandemic. Movie theaters were among the last places to reopen from lockdown in most states, and in New York, to take one example, most are still limited to about one-third capacity. In an interview with NBC, Miranda, who co-wrote the film with Quiara Alegría Hudes, the pair wanted to highlight Latino characters and culture, which are both frequently overlooked in Hollywood output. “We’re making up for lost time,” Miranda said. The film is based on Miranda’s 2008 musical of the same name, which preceded his global hit, Hamilton. He told NBC he and Hudes wanted to create non-stereotypical Latino characters: “Quiara and I stuck to our guns and stuck to what we felt was important in the storytelling of the show.” The first quarter of 2021 saw a decline of 90% in movie theater ticket sales, CNBC reported, but with 75% of North American theaters now open, the last two weekends have set pandemic-era records for tickets sold. Over the four-day Memorial Day weekend North America theaters brought in $100m in ticket sales – less than half the $232m over the same period in 2019, but an encouraging sign for studio executives. The Guardian critic Peter Bradshaw gave In the Heights three stars, describing it as “a sweet-natured film with Sunny-D optimism and a no-place-like-home ethic”, with “a pretty quaint image of street life, whose unrealities probably worked better on stage”.
69: The Saga of Danny Hernandez review – Tekashi69, fame-hungry narcissist, unwrapped	Independent film-maker Vikram Gandhi tells a truly all-American rags-to-riches-to-documentary-fodder story, one intensely grounded in the terroir of New York City, about his Bushwick neighbour Tekashi69, AKA 6ix9ine, AKA Danny Hernandez. Those over the age of 30 who are not au fait with what the kids are into these days may be less familiar with Hernandez’s story, and thus why he might be deserving of a documentary, so here are the key facts. Raised in poverty in Brooklyn’s not-yet-gentrified Bushwick, he went from working in a bodega to becoming a rap superstar notorious for his facial tattoos, rainbow-coloured hair, sexually explicit videos and gangster attitude. After several earlier brushes with the law, including pleading guilty to using a child in a sexual performance, he was arrested in 2018 on a number of charges including racketeering, conspiracy to commit murder and armed robbery, so he flipped on his own crew, the Nine Trey gang, got a reduced sentence and was later released from prison into home confinement because of the Covid outbreak. Editorialising throughout via voiceover, Gandhi adroitly navigates the problematic morality of his subject, a fame-hungry narcissist with a traumatic childhood, some talent and an ability to charm. But that doesn’t mean Gandhi, or more importantly the people in Hernandez’s life such as Sara Molina, his childhood sweetheart andthe mother of his child, or the friends he betrayed, have to forgive him. The film throws a wide net and features many in Hernandez’s circle, from his tattooist and the lovely woman who dyed his hair, to his producer, who remains loyal to the crazy kid he first met. Having been a cinematographer on several other films, Gandhi serves up great street footage of Bushwick and beyond. He also has a Werner Herzogian knack for hilariously weird moments, like the one in the opening scene where he’s trying to get someone to open up about Hernandez, only to have the interview sabotaged by a woman shouting from a window above (very New York) that he shouldn’t say shit about 6ix9ine, that he didn’t know the guy, that he has nothing to say. Even viewers who might find 6ix9ine and his gangbanger nonsense repugnant can still find much to admire in this well-made film essay. • 69: The Saga of Danny Hernandez is available on Altitude.film
The Hitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard review – Ryan Reynolds back in a tiresome sequel	Here’s the tiresome follow-up to the tiresome action comedy with the tiresomely (and unfunnily) muddled premise: bodyguards generally protect people against hitmen and hitmen generally don’t need bodyguards as they’re not publicly visible … but that wasn’t the point. Anyway, here’s the sequel with the extra-clumsy double-possessive in the title. Ryan Reynolds is back as Michael Bryce, the former triple-A rated bodyguard, now haunted and traumatised by his professional failures, and by his association with the notorious assassin Darius Kincaid, played by Samuel L Jackson. Michael is stripped of his “licence” to practise bodyguarding and is now in therapy; but just as he decides to take a restorative European break by the pool, Michael gets sucked right back into the melee by Kincaid’s badass wife Sonia, in which role Salma Hayek is once again phoning in her hellcat routine. So the wacky trio are back together again, Reynolds getting whatever laugh lines there are going, as he is bemused and depressed by the situation that this couple have put him in, though not as bemused and depressed as all of us in the audience. They find themselves up against Greek supervillain Aristotle Papadopoulous, played by Antonio Banderas with such an uncompromising refusal to do a Greek accent that at first I thought it had to be some kind of gag. The idea is that he will use a super-strong drill to damage the underwater junction box that holds the data for the European Union’s computer systems, as a revenge for the EU beating up on his home country. (This would have been topical around the time of the “Grexit” row of 2012.) So we have loads of Euro-locations and loads of car chase scenes through picturesque tourist cities, with cars lumbering down crumbling stone steps and at one stage even smashing through the traditional fruit-stall. There are also some weirdly pedantic references to the Goldie Hawn comedy Overboard, perhaps to pre-empt objections to possible plot-borrowings. To add to all his anxieties, Michael is also afflicted by feelings of inferiority in comparison with his stepfather, a legendary veteran bodyguard: a great big comedy cameo for a big name who is entirely wasted in the part. There are some almost-laughs here and there, but please tell me that we aren’t in for The Hitman’s Mother-In-Law’s Agent’s Bodyguard in 2023. • The Hitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard is released on 18 June in cinemas.
Running Against the Wind review – brothers fight for their future in Ethiopian sports drama	Opening with the impressionistic image of a young man sprinting across the desert, his figure blurred by the sandy blast of a dust devil, Jan Philipp Weyl’s film ruminates on life’s unexpected whirlwinds that can either uplift one’s hopes or blow them to pieces. Abdi (Ashenafi Nigusu) and Solomon (Mikias Wolde) are childhood friends who grow up in rural Ethiopia. Their paths diverge dramatically when Solomon runs away to the big city with dreams of becoming a photographer, only to end up on the streets, scraping for food and mixing with bad company. Ten years later, Abdi, who idolises the Olympic runner Haile Gebrselassie, also moves to the capital, where he continues training and even wins a national championship. After an emotional reunion, Abdi tries to pull Solomon out of his precarious situation, but fate has other plans. The film deftly explores the complexities of brotherhood, be it the bond between Solomon and his fellow outcasts, or the camaraderie among Abdi’s athletic team. Though perhaps not always assured in their performances, Nigusu and Wolde capture their characters’ first hug after years apart in a beautifully bittersweet moment. Shyly smiling at each other, the two young men suddenly and movingly revert to their childhood selves. Such intimacy, however, is overshadowed by dramatic contrivances: instead of focusing on the changing tides of the pair’s rapport, the film jumps from sports film empowerment cliches to full-on action sequence, making for an inconsistent tone. Quibbles aside, this is still an engaging watch that even gets a cameo from Gebrselassie. The deft camerawork showcases a dynamic Ethiopia – from tiny villages to the gritty underbelly of bustling Addis Ababa – and, let’s face it, everyone loves a good training montage. • Running Against the Wind is released on 11 June on digital platforms.
Ellie & Abbie (& Ellie’s Dead Aunt) review – lesbian romcom could do better	It could have been a sweet, gay coming-of-age story about a girl whose sexual awakening is complicated by unwelcome gay mentorship from the ghost of her lesbian aunt. But there’s a disconnect between the naive but well-intentioned storytelling and the explosive swearing that ensures a 15 certificate and places the film out of reach of the younger teen audience who might, otherwise, have been its most receptive. Still, as Ellie and Abbie respectively, Sophie Hawkshaw and Zoe Terakes make light work of a somewhat heavy-handed screenplay.
Nobody review – Bob Odenkirk is a blast in action man mode	Bob Odenkirk, best known for playing a gutter lawyer in Better Call Saul, is not the first name that springs to mind to claim the aggrieved everyman action slot recently vacated by Liam Neeson. But from the opening shot – battered face cross-hatched with scratches, shackled hands effortlessly snapping open a Zippo lighter – the question is not the casting, but what took Hollywood so long to weaponise the ineffable coolness of Odenkirk. He plays Hutch Mansell, a sad sack number-cruncher at his father-in-law’s factory and husband adrift from his distant wife (Connie Nielsen). Snappy editing gives a flick-book summary of the daily disappointments of Hutch’s life and Russian director Ilya Naishuller combines a showily kinetic verve with a crackle of wry humour. When thieves break into his home, Hutch chooses de-escalation rather than baseball bat retaliation - the right thing to do - but he feels himself diminished in the eyes of his family. The event awakens something within him, but it’s the realisation that the thieves stole his daughter’s kitty-cat bracelet that unleashes a long dormant lust for justice (deployed with knives, guns, grenades, fire extinguishers and his pensioner dad, sprung from the retirement home and armed to the dentures). Hutch finds a worthy adversary in “connected, funded sociopath” Yulian (Aleksey Serebryakov), a Russian in a shiny suit that looks like it was flayed from a live shark. And if this all sounds a little John Wick-a-like, that’s perhaps to be expected – the films share a writer in Derek Kolstad, Hollywood’s go-to guy for crazy-violent, hyper-adrenalised popcorn thrills. It’s a blast.
Don’t Look Back review – smartphone morality shocker fails to connect	There was something almost camp about death in the Final Destination series, the invisible hand that toyed with us as it liquidated its characters. Franchise originator Jeffrey Reddick tries to recapture that high-concept magic in his directorial debut Don’t Look Back, also about a lethal force stalking a group bound by calamity. But here he bleaches it of humour and adds a nagging moralistic component – possibly with an eye on the faith-movie market. This time, karma is the invisible antagonist stalking six “bad Samaritans”, who fail to intervene – one committing the cardinal sin and whipping out his smartphone instead – when a local philanthropist gets beaten up at the park. But for Caitlin (Kourtney Bell) her paralysis has personal reasons: it triggers flashbacks to the recent home invasion in which her father was killed. Not that that excuse placates the victim’s brother, Lucas (Will Stout), and hostile public opinion. When one of the group makes a sudden upper-storey window exit, there seems to be some supernatural Jeremy Kyle coming to pass judgment on them all – or so Caitlin believes. With Don’t Look Back very much feeling like a ropey first draft of Final Destination, Reddick’s gimmick here is fuzzy compared to the franchise’s ruthless focus on the feasibility of outsmarting death. In Don’t Look Back, Reddick tries to set Caitlin a similar fiendish brainteaser, rooted in serial appearances of the number 27, but it is thin gruel plot-wise. The least we can ask for are some virtuoso demises – but with the film only half-heartedly invested in the inter-group dynamics and the individual stakes involved, they are disappointingly vanilla and unimpactful when they come. Karma, it seems, operates mostly by unlucky falls. It’s simpler for Don’t Look Back to preach fire and brimstone on the smartphone dilemma – which, when virtually everyone in the digital age is guilty of voyeurism to some degree, feels rather early-2000s and un-nuanced. The directing is serviceable, but some rote imagery – especially the ominous crow of death – also likes to hit us over the head. Reddick should have concentrated on giving the characters that kind of treatment. • Don’t Look Back is release on digital platforms on 14 June.
Shock Wave: Hong Kong Destruction review – one long tick-tick-boom symphony	The “2” in the original title of this film would suggest this Hong Kong-action thriller is a sequel – or more likely a prequel given its ending – to the 2017 film Shock Wave, which like this starred megastar Andy Lau and was directed by one of his regular collaborators, Herman Yau. In fact, there’s no connective narrative tissue at all between the films, apart from the fact that the hero in both works for the Hong Kong police department’s Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) bureau, or bomb disposal unit. Still, the end result offers a regular drumbeat of suspense-followed-by-explosion throughout – one long tick-tick-boom symphony, in fact – which makes for fitfully stimulating entertainment. Lau plays Poon Sing-fung, the EOD’s most reckless yet heroic debomber, who is best friends with his superior, Tung (Ching Wan Lau), and in a happy romantic relationship with pretty police officer Pong Ling (Ni Ni). The couple’s happiness is mostly represented in the early scenes by her looking simperingly at him while he laughs in a reckless yet heroic fashion. But one call-out goes wrong, and just when Poon thinks he’s saved everyone in a squalid flat, a cat in a booby-trapped microwave blows up and Poon loses half of his left leg. Nevertheless, he puts everything into building up strength in his remaining limbs in order to return to his old job, which not so coincidentally dovetails with Lau’s real-world support for the Paralympics and disabled athletes. Then the movie rapidly gets much more tricksy in its storytelling: a group of terrorists called Vendetta are sifted into the mix; they are led by a white-haired Julian Assange-like leader (Tse Kwan-Ho) and are hellbent on blowing stuff up and getting revenge for past slights. Has Poon, like Lau’s character in Infernal Affairs (the model for The Departed), been a mole all this time in the terrorist organisation? Or is he a mole posing as a mole? A bad case of post-traumatic amnesia Poon suffers after yet another explosion means even he doesn’t know which side he used to be on, or which one he wants to be on now. It’s all a bit otiose and a little stale, especially all the ersatz medical talk about brain injuries. Despite a few modish touches, this feels fundamentally very old-school, and not necessarily in a good way, right down to the repeated shots of people running away from fireballs in the background. • Shock Wave: Hong Kong Destruction is released on 14 June on digital platforms.
Parallel review – nonsense in the multiverse	Four friends find a portal to a multitude of parallel, nearly identical universes but get lodged in numerous plotholes that lead precisely nowhere, in this sporadically entertaining but illogical Canadian sci-fi. Leena (Georgia King) uses the opportunity to further her artistic career; Devin (Aml Ameen) seeks a reality in which his father is still alive; Noel (Martin Wallström) favours a punishing double-pronged approach that combines corporate espionage and petty revenge on alternate versions of his enemies. And Josh (Mark O’Brien) just wants to get laid. Montages, seesawing Dutch tilts and profligate overuse of lighting gels fail to conceal the fact that the film’s writing doesn’t match the lure of the central idea.
69: The Saga of Danny Hernandez review – fact or act?	Danny Hernandez, AKA rapper and internet troll Tekashi69 AKA 6ix9ine, started life as a damaged and fatherless Hispanic kid from Brooklyn, driven by a hunger for wealth, fame and, most of all, a need to be seen at any cost. Everything – from the facial tattoos, to the rainbow hair, to the sexually explicit videos, to the embrace of gang culture – was ultimately about provoking a response that could be immediately quantified in clicks and follows: “clout”. But was the persona 6ix9ine an act or a kind of addiction? Was he a professional troll – the Katie Hopkins of hardcore hip-hop – or a genius marketeer? This intriguing documentary fails to fully answer these questions, but it does shine a light on a particularly uneasy aspect of internet celebrity.
The Viewing Booth review – seeing is believing in the Israel-Palestine conflict	Even though he tries to maintain a cool, scientific demeanour, Israeli director Ra’anan Alexandrowicz finally lets slip a twinge of despair at the end of this interesting geopolitical Rorschach test. Alexandrowicz sits studiously behind a monitor as he invites a succession of volunteers to enter an adjacent booth. There, they have a choice of 40 clips to watch, snippets of life in Israel, while he asks them to share their thoughts on what they see. Half of the clips are from rightwing Israeli sources; the other half are from B’Tselem, an Israeli human-rights organisation that aims to document abuses of power in Palestinian territories. Alexandrowicz quickly zeroes in on the pensive Maia, a Jewish American who supports Israel, but brings an insistent scepticism to everything she watches. He is the director of pro-Palestine documentaries such as The Inner Tour (2001) and The Law in These Parts (2011) – and believes her to be his ideal audience: a possible convert. From the sympathy she displays on watching flagrant abuses such as a soldier kicking a street kid, that seems like a realistic hope. But it’s quickly apparent that Maia filters everything through confirmation bias. When one child seems to misremember his own name in a B’Tselem video of a home search by Israeli soldiers, she wonders whether it has been staged. At the same time as interrogating the film-makers’ agenda, Maia is also aware of her own possible distortions, which stem from a desire to believe that Israeli actions are justified. Above and beyond the Middle Eastern context, this is the kind of due diligence – a state of permanent alertness about film-maker and viewer, their intentions and baggage – that our information-saturated age demands of all of us. Alexandrowicz brings Maia, with a sleek new haircut, back for a second session, to review the footage and her own initial reactions. But she doubles down, saying: “Sometimes when you question your beliefs and you come up with better answers, they reinforce your beliefs even more.” The director, on the back foot, just about clings to his sang-froid. Not just a valuable crash course in digital-age hermeneutics, this is a gauntlet thrown down to film-makers with an old-fashioned belief in the truth. • The Viewing Booth is in cinemas from 18 June.
Edge of the World review – swashbuckling white saviour biopic feels out of date	While the name James Brooke might seem obscure to many viewers, his exploits in south-east Asia, retold here in Michael Haussman’s adventure biopic, are not so foreign. After all, they inspired Joseph Conrad’s Lord Jim and Rudyard Kipling’s The Man Who Would Be King. Brooke’s stranger-than-fiction journey from ex-soldier in the Bengal army to becoming the White Rajah of Sarawak, which once attracted the attention of Errol Flynn, is especially ripe for the silver screen. Alas, Edge of the World fails to do justice to this fascinating and deeply complex chapter in British colonial history. The film begins with Brooke (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) arriving in picturesque Sarawak via boat, along with his cousin Arthur (Dominic Monaghan) and nephew Charley (Otto Farrant), both army men. Their presence is immediately met with suspicion and hostility from the local aristocrats, especially Prince Mahkota (Bront Palarae). Brooke’s courageous efforts during a pirates’ siege, however, lead to his being crowned Rajah, much to the dismay of Mahkota. As Brooke strives to establish the domain as a sovereign nation, his reign faces Mahkota’s bloody attacks, not to mention criminal charges from the British empire. Edge of the World cannot, unfortunately, resist over mythologising Brooke’s legacy; such an approach only strips the first White Rajah of his complexities and ambiguities. Sidestepping the hard question of whether Brooke is a white saviour, the narrative’s superficial view appears to suggest that he is a “benevolent” imperialist merely because, unlike his peers, he does not say racist things out loud. Meanwhile, Brooke’s actual policies and style of governance remain largely unexplored, overshadowed by a romance plot and endless depictions of gory native customs. As Edge of the World gradually veers into Apocalypse Now territory, the ties between Sarawak and Brooke turn woefully simplistic. Edge of the World might work as an ode to bygone swashbuckling classics, but Brooke deserves a much more nuanced biopic. • Edge of the World is on digital platforms from 18 June.
John Boorman: how a belligerent Ned Beatty won me over | Letter	I saw Ned Beatty (Obituary, 14 June) in regional theatre. He had no experience in radio or television and rather looked down on them, but in many ways he fitted my idea of the character of Bobby in Deliverance. Ned was very late for his audition. He had worked himself up into a frenzy of aggression. “Are you really going to make this crap?” he said. He had already convinced himself he had lost the part. He continued to abuse me and the project. I loved his passion. I said: “Stop shouting, Ned, you got the part.” He was a wonderful actor, and his anger was very useful. It often made the other three actors and myself fall about laughing. I loved him dearly. John Boorman Director, Deliverance • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Superdeep review – spore-squirting Soviet horror ends up fusty	Like Chernobyl with mould, this Soviet-era-set Russian horror-sci-fi follows experts racing against the clock to put the lid on a disaster inside a government facility: here it’s a top secret research station seven miles underground, the source of an apocalyptic outbreak of fungus. As with Chernobyl, the movie features strong 80s moustaches, lab coats, and characters frequently prefixing “comrade” to each other’s names. Exasperatingly, the missing ingredient is a well-developed storyline; nothing in the muddled script hangs together. I had the feeling I’d walked into the cinema five minutes late and missed some critical all-explaining first scene. What Superdeep does have going for it is a cracking hero: a brilliant young epidemiologist sent in by military top brass to gather samples of whatever is happening underground. She is Anna (Milena Radulović), a character who shares DNA with Jodie Foster in The Silence of the Lambs with a little of Ripley from the Alien movies. Rather than snap into bad-ass butt-kicker at the first sign of trouble, Anna takes on the forces of fungus with her brains. In fact, during the scary bits she looks terrified, deathly pale, breathing shallowly. In a film of laughably bad dialogue – I kept my eye firmly on her face (oh, and her Soviet-chic yellow roll-neck). Worryingly, on the way down to the research unit, one of the grizzled miners being evacuated growls: “It’s hell down there.” What Anna finds – without getting spoilery – is a spore-squirting Alien-inspired parasitical nightmare. To begin, there are a couple of genuinely repulsive horror moments, but things get silly very quickly. The film finishes in retro disaster-movie mode: emergency red lights flashing, alarms blaring – anyone who’s still alive crawling about in the dark and dust. Irritatingly the script engineers a way for Anna to do this in her vest and knickers. What a let-down. • Superdeep is released on 17 June on Shudder.
Gone Girl and Cocktail actor Lisa Banes, 65, dies after scooter collision in New York	Actor Lisa Banes, 65, star of stage and screen, has died after a hit-and-run collision last week in New York. “We are heartsick of Lisa’s tragic and senseless passing,” a representative for Banes said. “She was a woman of great spirit, kindness and generosity and dedicated to her work, whether on stage or in front of a camera and even more so to her wife, family and friends... We were blessed to have had her in our lives.” Banes was taken to hospital after she was struck by a scooter or motorcycle in Manhattan while crossing the road outside the Lincoln Center to visit her former drama school Julliard. Banes’ wife, Kathryn Kranhold, urged people to pray for Banes and to contact the police if they had any information about the scooter driver, who has not yet been found. Banes played the mother of Rosamund Pike’s character in the 2014 David Fincher film Gone Girl. Other big screen roles included an older woman romanced by Tom Cruise in Cocktail, as well as a boardroom executive in A Cure for Wellness. She was a regular on and off Broadway after her 1984 breakthrough in Isn’t It Romantic?, with key parts in Neil Simon’s Rumors opposite Christine Baranski; Tom Stoppard’s Arcadia with Paul Giamatti and Billy Crudup, and a 1998 revival of Cole Porter’s High Society with Anna Kendrick. On television, Banes had recurring roles on Nashville, Royal Pains, and Six Feet Under and guested on multiple sitcoms including Frasier, Roseanne and The King of Queens as well as cop and sci-fi shows. Seth MacFarlane, who worked with Banes recently on The Orville, tweeted that “her stage presence, magnetism, skill and talent were matched only by her unwavering kindness and graciousness towards all of us. A tremendous loss.” Singer-songwriter Jill Sobule, a friend of Banes, said she was “just busted” over the news. “Lisa Banes was magnificent, hilarious, and big-hearted – always helped me through the hard times. She was so beloved by so many.”
Treasure City review – bizarre, oppressive and horribly brutal	A one-night-in-the-city movie from Hungary with an ensemble cast interconnecting and interrelating in bizarrely unexpected ways; the city in question is perhaps Budapest, though it was filmed in Cluj, in Romania. The keynotes are anger, confusion and despair, and to some degree the film could have been opaque or contrived but its malaise ultimately finds expression in a truly horrible #MeToo moment, one of the most brutally plausible and unsettling I have seen in any film recently. The cast are various: the organisers of a protest against the reactionary government have a row over competency, and an associate of theirs has a romantic moment with a Mohawk-haired teen son of a sourly depressed pastor and his angry wife. A woman has a furious row with a rude and supercilious sales assistant in a flower shop. Her husband is enraged to hear of a sad romantic escapade in the past and their 10-year-old daughter turns out to have magic powers. They have a link with an intimate and experimental “living room theatre” troupe whose deeply unpleasant director is a predatory rapist, furnishing this movie with the climactically horrendous scene near the end. And so it goes on, with the various lives playing out more or less simultaneously. This is an odd film, opaque and withdrawn, and with a muted and discreet kind of surrealism, particularly in its cafe scenes, that reminded me a little of directors such as Roy Andersson or Aki Kaurismäki, only without the emollient touch of comedy. Quite a lot of the movie is oppressively sexualised, in ways that create a charged and dangerous atmosphere, but also somehow unrewarding. Where is it all leading? That isn’t clear, though the abuse scene seems to grow like a dark flower from the estrangement and unhappiness that has gone before. • Treasure City is in cinemas and on digital platforms from 18 June.
The Reason I Jump review – an empathic study of nonverbal autism	Here is a documentary with something to tell us and something to teach us. It’s inspired by the 2007 book of the same name by the Japanese teenager Naoki Higashida, who has nonverbal autism: explaining why he behaves as he does, when and why he feels joy and fear and why he sometimes jumps, why he responds with great and uncontrolled physical activity. It was translated into English in 2013 by Keiko Yoshida and her husband, the British novelist David Mitchell. The original book was transcribed by Higashida’s mother by getting him to use an alphabet-grid prompt system, leading some sceptics to claim that the book was basically authored by her: a rendering of what she thinks her son is thinking, or even just a YA fantasy. But this film is actually a vigorous rebuttal to this, and makes an overwhelmingly plausible case that young neurodivergent people really can communicate through the alphabet-grid. The film shows young people with autism from all over the world, from the US to the UK to India and Africa, and brings us into their world, letting us appreciate how they are sometimes drowned by sensory perception and emotion, by memories that they cannot structure and contextualise the way others can. But the film also shows that though speech is effectively a fine motor activity that eludes them, pointing out letters on a grid is a gross motor skill that can be mastered – simply, they can point at letters – and so self-expression is possible. It is an intriguing and empathic study, which could help all of us to understand. My only quibble is that the voiceover representing Higashida’s narration is a little mannered and I would have liked to hear more specifically about the way some neurodivergent people appear to have a brilliant artistic sense (there is one such here) and their artistry does not consist of abstract emotional splodges but meticulously rendered drawings with just that sense of proportion and scale that seems to be the problem in other aspects of autistic people’s lives. Well, it is an excellent and educational work. • This article was amended on 21 June 2021 to correct references to neurodiverse people to neurodivergent people. • The Reason I Jump is released on 18 June in cinemas.
Friendship’s Death review – Tilda Swinton goes alien in a radical-chic Beckettian fable	In 1987, the late English critic, theorist and film-maker Peter Wollen directed his only solo feature film: an insouciantly baffling two-hander called Friendship’s Death, now rereleased. It was a cinema of ideas, rare then, rarer now, high-mindedly produced by the British Film Institute and Channel 4. Bill Paterson plays Sullivan: a hardbitten, boozy journalist holed up in a shabby hotel in Amman in Jordan in 1970, during the civil war and the “Black September” era of PLO hijackings. He is astonished – though, amusingly, never quite as astonished you think he ought to be – to be confronted by a hyperintelligent and ethereally beautiful young woman named Friendship, who hangs out in his room and reveals herself to be a creature sent from a distant planet to study humankind. She is played by Tilda Swinton, like a cross between ET and David Bowie in The Man Who Fell to Earth. There’s a fair bit of posturing and radical chic happening in this movie and it’s sometimes a little glib. But the droll double-act chemistry between Paterson and Swinton is unexpectedly great, especially considering the enigmatically childlike and lovably humourless demeanour that Swinton often projects. It’s not at all clear to me if Wollen or Swinton realised that this film is a comedy, but I think that this is what Friendship’s Death is: Beckettian in its way, but with something more emollient. Having crossly objected to the way Sullivan deafeningly hammers out his stories by banging away at the typewriter keys, Friendship taps out something of her own, taking up the machine when Sullivan probably needs it to file a story. “What are you typing?” asks the exasperated Sullivan. “My dream,” Friendship pertly replies. “… I dream of succulents, the flow of carbon in acid metabolism, hunters and gatherers …” Later we see Friendship alertly watching a football match on television, Arsenal v Spurs. (Could you watch first division fixtures in Amman hotel rooms in 1970? Live or just highlights?) “It’s hard for me to see the attraction of it …” she says. As a semiotician, Wollen couldn’t resist closing the film with a wordless five-minute sequence, a recorded message from Friendship, which the audience had to decode as best they could. I wonder if Paterson and Swinton could be persuaded to reunite for a sequel: Friendship’s Survival? • Friendship’s Death is released on 21 June on digital platforms.
Battle of the Bulge: Winter War review – a fight until the bitter end	This stilted, herky-jerky tale of Yankee heroism – written and directed by, as well as starring, Steven Luke – seems to be a sequel to Luke’s earlier second world war saga, Wunderland, a work not well-reviewed nor widely seen. In this instalment, Luke’s wholesome, square-jawed protagonist Lt Cappa and his ethnically diverse yet strangely interchangeable-looking men are defending a field hospital just behind the frontline near Lanzerath, Belgium, as the titular Battle of the Bulge rages in December 1944. The larger goal for the allies, represented here mostly by Tom Berenger and Billy Zane talking in a tent as they play Maj McCulley and Gen Omar Bradley, is to take control of fuel supplies to the Germans who might be on the verge of winning the war. Plus, there’s a squad of American MPs knocking around with almost comically exaggerated accents who turn out to be German spies. Luckily, Cappa and his comrades sense there’s something off about this crew, especially when they try to commandeer their jeeps and suggest leaving the wounded behind to die. Apparently, Winter War was shot in Minnesota, Illinois and South Dakota, which would account for why nearly everything seems to take place in temporary buildings, and we see so little of the local Belgians that the Americans are ostensibly trying to save. The dialogue is risibly cliche-ridden and, although chock full of explication, utterly confusing in terms of explaining what’s going on. It all feels very dated and artless, like someone’s grandpa wrote the script 50 years ago and it was found in a drawer, then financed and made with a not inconsiderable budget for extras, vintage tanks and lots of old uniforms. The widescreen cinematography is actually rather lush, but more might have been better spent on editing and a musical score that actually syncs up with the action. • Battle of the Bulge: Winter War is released on 21 June on digital platforms.
Sherni review – Vidya Balan joins the hunt for a man-eating tiger	After the success of his 2017 political black comedy Newton, director Amit V Masurkar once again aims to shed light on India’s contemporary social issues. Ostensibly a thriller, Sherni tackles sexism and the absurdities of bureaucracy, all in relation to the age-old conflict between man and nature. The title, which means “tigress” in Hindi, refers not only to the wandering animal at the centre of the film’s clashes but also the protagonist, forest officer Vidya Vincent (Vidya Balan). A taciturn government worker, Vidya’s fierceness shows itself in her astonishing resilience: determined to capture the man-eating tiger alive, she rails against her uncaring, opportunistic superiors and the local politicians who use the animal to incite villagers to violence. In the end, Vidya’s compassion bucks against an incendiary, bloodthirsty hunter who only wants the poor beast dead. Balan excels here with a subtle performance that avoids platitudinous girl-power poses. Underneath Vidya’s quiet exterior is a resolute refusal to cower to authority, and thus, when she hits a roadblock in her quest, the slightest crack in her composure feels shattering. Masurkar’s signature dark humour is in evidence in visual details: Vidya’s boss, for instance, has a gigantic photo of a tiger in his office, but is completely oblivious to the specificities of conservation work. But unlike with Newton, Masurkar is credited for co-writing the dialogue but not the full screenplay, and perhaps this is why Sherni lacks the mathematical exactness of Newton’s satire. In fact, the film operates much like the roaming tiger, meandering from political commentary to a study of women in a male-dominated field. These are important issues, but Sherni reiterates near-identical scenes of confrontation without delving into their causes, thus wasting the excellent cast of veteran character actors. Still, this is an engaging excursion into the trials and tribulations of environmental conservation, which rarely get fictionalised on screen. • Sherni is released on 18 June on Amazon Prime Video.
Scarlett Johansson criticises ‘hypersexualisation’ of Black Widow in Iron Man 2	Scarlett Johansson has spoken out against the sexualisation of Black Widow in Iron Man 2, the 2010 blockbuster in which her character first appeared in the Marvel Cinematic Universe series. Speaking in a pool interview in the run-up to the release of the standalone Black Widow film, Johansson said: “While [Iron Man 2] was really fun and had a lot of great moments in it, the character is so sexualised, you know? [She is] really talked about like she’s a piece of something, like a possession or a thing or whatever – like a piece of ass, really. And Tony even refers to her as something like that at one point … ‘I want some.’” Johansson appears to be referring to the scene in Iron Man 2 when, as Natalie Rushman, Black Widow meets Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) for the first time. After flicking through a series of pictures of Rushman, including one of the character in lingerie, Stark tells Gwyneth Paltrow’s Pepper Potts: “I want one.” (Potts earlier refers to Rushman as “a very expensive sexual harassment lawsuit if you keep ogling her”.) Johansson added: “Maybe at that time that actually felt like a compliment. You know what I mean? Because my thinking was different … My own self-worth was probably measured against that type of comment [but], like a lot of young women, you come into your own and you understand your own self-worth.” Johansson went on to say that “young girls are getting a much more positive message” and that “it’s been incredible to be a part of that shift and be able to come out the other side”. Johansson praised the “move away from the kind of hypersexualization of this character” in the new Black Widow film, which co-stars Florence Pugh and is directed by Cate Shortland. She said: “I’m a mom and my life is different. Obviously, 10 years have passed and things have happened and I have a much different, more evolved understanding of myself. As a woman, I’m in a different place in my life, you know?”
One in a Thousand review – Argentinian teen’s hoop dreams, hanging out and hoping	This is an LGBT urban pastoral from film-maker Clarisa Navas, set in a tough barrio in Corrientes province, north-eastern Argentina. Sofia Cabrera plays Iris, a teenage girl who appears to have been excluded from school – although that doesn’t make her lifestyle any more obviously aimless than all the people she’s hanging out with. Iris is obsessed with basketball and spends most of her days loafing around, shooting hoops, talking with her brother and cousins, and chatting with the neighbourhood kids, gay and straight. Then she chances across a charismatic older woman called Renata (Ana Carolina García), who has an elegantly wasted image; Renata has mysteriously been abroad for a while and apparently dances at a local club called Traumatic, where she appears to be on the fringe of sex work. Some are saying that she has HIV – although this may simply be spite. Iris and Renata are drawn to each other and soon they are in love. Navas conjures up a whole world in which there is apparently little or nothing to do but participate in an endless round of hanging out, hooking up, breaking up, gossiping and lying dreamily on a bed thinking about it all. She contrives many open-ended walk-and-walk travelling shots, in which Iris and Renata just lope around the neighbourhood, chatting and scouting locations in which they might kiss without being interrupted. Navas is clearly in command of a very distinctive, confident film-making language. This is clearly a story that means a lot to her personally, but I felt that the movie was spinning its wheels a little after a while; it is disconcerting that she relied on an act of violence to close the narrative. But this is engaging, intelligent film-making and Navas’s performers relax into the space that she creates for them. • One in a Thousand is released on 18 June on Mubi.
Golden Globes: two members resign from ‘toxic’ Hollywood Foreign Press Association	Two members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), the body that organises the Golden Globes, have resigned, denouncing the organisation as “toxic” in a letter obtained by the LA Times. In their letter, Wenting Xu and Diederik van Hoogstraten said that “staying inside the association is no longer tenable for us”. They list a number of reasons, including that “the majority of the membership resists deep change”, new rules to improved diversity have been “watered down”, and that “fear of retribution, self-dealing, corruption and verbal abuse” are still central to the HFPA’s culture. They added: “The HFPA continues to accommodate a toxic environment that undermines professional journalism. The bullying of members by fellow members is left unquestioned and unpunished. The badgering of talent and publicists: ditto … many members continue to believe we are victims, an attitude that guarantees no self-reflection or change will occur.” Xu is a reporter for New York-based trade publication World Screen, while Van Hoogstraten is a producer and freelance contributor to a number of Dutch outlets including NRC Handelsblad and Het Financieele Dagblad, and is a former HFPA board member. The HPFA has been under fire since the LA Times ran an exposé on the eve of the 2021 Golden Globes, citing allegations of corruption and impropriety as well as the absence of any black members. The organisation was subsequently hit by an industry boycott and the cancellation of the TV broadcast of the 2022 Globes. High-profile figures, including Tom Cruise and Scarlett Johansson, have been outspoken in their criticism. The HFPA has struggled to form a coherent response, with its plans for reform receiving further criticism from influential industry groups such as Time’s Up. The LA Times reports that Xu and Van Hoogstraten have repeatedly complained to the HFPA, with one board member responding that Xu’s comments were a “hate campaign” and that she was “working … against us”. In their letter, Xu and Van Hoogstraten say they plan to set up “a transparent, professional and inclusive organisation for the current and next generations of reporters”.
Dr Bird’s Advice for Sad Poets review – quirky teenage hero gets life lessons from a pigeon	Unhappy teenagers are each unhappy in their own way. But there is a movie template for the unhappiness of a certain kind of male of the species: that hypersensitive socially awkward outsider who sees right through the phoniness of the adult world and expresses himself with freakish maturity. Not wandering too far from the standard is 16-year-old James Whitman (Lucas Jade Zumann) the poet hero of this coming-of-age comedy with sad-serious bits. James has anxiety and depression, and he’s obsessed in a big way with his namesake, the poet Walt Whitman. The Dr Bird of the title is his imaginary psychiatrist, who he quirkily visualises as a pigeon (nicely voiced by Tom Wilkinson). The movie follows James as he searches for his older sister, who mysteriously disappeared after a blazing row with their dad Carl (Jason Isaacs), an angry navy veteran. The family dysfunction stuff is sensitively handled with some originality; Carl is nicknamed “the brute” by his wife, a frustrated artist, and the kids, who hold him responsible as the fount of all unhappiness in the family. The truth turns out to be a little more nuanced. Less interesting is the offbeat hunt for James’s sister, who he discovers has links with a cult. Cue a deeply unfunny Wes Anderson-ish sequence featuring David Arquette as a sleazy hippy cult leader surrounded by chanting acolytes. Director Yaniv Raz loads up on irritating stylistic touches: there’s a cowboy movie-style showdown James has with a kid who used to date his girlfriend Sophie (Taylor Russell); and the poster of Walt Whitman on his bedroom wall that comes alive. We don’t get to see so much as a scintilla of Sophie’s inner life. “I’m not some quirky character who exists to give you an epiphany,” she tells him. It’s a smart line but I’m not sure it’s true. Nor does the movie quite know how to handle James’s mental health: eccentric idiosyncrasy or Serious Issue? • Dr Bird’s Advice for Sad Poets is released on 21 June on digital platforms.
In the Heights review – a blast of sunshine, hope and hotpants	This adaptation of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s 2005 stage musical bursts on to the screen like a confetti cannon. Director Jon M Chu (Crazy Rich Asians) delivers a blast of sunshine, hope and hotpants. But unpeel the song-and-dance romance and escapism and there’s a socially engaged, issue-led drama under the sparkle and pizzazz. Of course it’s not unprecedented for superficially frivolous musicals to tackle serious issues: Cabaret explored the rise of fascism in Germany. Numerous Bollywood spectaculars have delved into the caste system, and West Side Story deals with the immigrant experience and gang-based tensions. It’s with the latter that In the Heights bears some similarities: both feature Latinx communities; both unfold on the streets of New York City. But while West Side Story is driven by conflict, at the core of In the Heights is a sentimental hug of neighbourhood unity – Washington Heights against the world, and the double-pronged assault of gentrification and discrimination. It’s from this, and from the engaging cast (Anthony Ramos is a particular delight; Olga Merediz single-handedly shifts the whole film up an emotional notch or 10), that the film derives its inviting warmth. Ramos plays Usnavi, the central character and the film’s narrator, a bodega worker who dreams of returning to his parents’ Dominican Republic homeland, but whose ties to Washington Heights – and in particular the lovely Vanessa (Melissa Barrera) – are hard to break. The messaging can be a little on-the-nose at times – a climactic electrical outtage gives the film the opportunity to assert that its characters are not, in fact, powerless. But perhaps a more potent political statement is the way that Christopher Scott’s choreography claims and owns every square inch of the block. Reclaim the streets (with fabulous shoes and glorious Latin dance routines)!
Luca review – gentle Pixar tale packed to the gills with charm	The latest from Pixar, and the feature directing debut of Enrico Casarosa, Luca is a gentle pleasure about friendship and not quite fitting in. Luca, voiced by Room’s Jacob Tremblay, is a sea monster who longs to explore the world beyond the reef. He knows that once on land he will assume human form, but good kids like Luca don’t break the rules. Then he meets Alberto (Jack Dylan Grazer), an adolescent sea monster-turned-boy who has made a life on land. There’s kinship here with Finding Nemo and with Studio Ghibli’s Ponyo, both in the marine setting and in the fact that it plays to the younger end of the audience spectrum. But while Luca might lack some of the dizzying inventiveness that marks out top-tier Pixar, it’s packed to the gills with charm.
It Must Be Heaven review – Elia Suleiman’s comedy creeps up on you	The Palestinian director Elia Suleiman, known for his deadpan observational comedies and the most expressively quizzical eyebrows in the business, returns after a decade’s absence. In common with his other films (Divine Intervention, The Time That Remains, among others), Suleiman appears in It Must Be Heaven as a droll, near-silent presence, bearing witness to the absurdities of the world around him. That world expands beyond Palestine; the film’s journey takes him to Paris and New York in search of funding for a movie that is deemed to be “not Palestinian enough”. Wry rather than uproarious, it’s a little uneven at times. But Suleiman is a master of slow-burning, cumulative humour; this is the kind of comedy that creeps up on you.
The Hitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard review – a nausea whack	The thuddingly stupid 2017 action comedy The Hitman’s Bodyguard gets the sequel it deserves. If anything, The Hitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard is even more obnoxious and lazy, with a screenplay that imposes a thankless “Mexican hellcat” cliche of a role on Salma Hayek, and which eschews jokes in favour of lots of shouty swearing. The dismal dialogue wouldn’t matter quite so much if at least the action sequences delivered a few thrills, but the whole thing is so shoddily put together it looks as though it was edited with a strimmer. Ryan Reynolds does himself very few favours in a role that trades on his least likable characteristics (the smirk and the fake tan).
The Reason I Jump review – a sensitive autistic eye on the world	A straight adaptation of The Reason I Jump, by the 13-year-old non-verbal autistic boy Naoki Higashida, would never have done his groundbreaking 2007 book justice. Higashida used his writing to answer the questions that the neurotypical world might have about the autistic experience. Jerry Rothwell’s approach to bringing the book to the screen is sensitive and creative, a sometimes expressionistic, sensually eloquent riff on the source material that draws in the voices of other autistic young people and their carers, and which continues the conversation that Higashida’s work initiated. The voices of neurodivergent people, the film explains, might not be articulated in spoken language: in India, Amrit finds her means of expression through drawing; in Arlington, Virginia, best friends Emma Budway and Ben McGann communicate through alphabet boards. Meanwhile, Rothwell uses the language of cinema – macro lens closeups, distortion, off-kilter framing and an evocative blend of sound design and score – to convey the autistic experience of the world.
Tyger Tyger review – spaced-out apocalypse chic in pandemic thriller	Sometimes a film comes along that reminds you why you shouldn’t go to Coachella, Burning Man or any kind of rave-adjacent event filled with Gen Z kids or millennials. Not that this dystopian, near-future road movie is actually set during a music festival. It’s more like the sort of fare that might be projected in a movie tent at such an event, where people coming down off a bad dose of Molly lie about hoping the throbbing will stop soon. Unfortunately, this movie is the throbbing. The ostensible plot concerns some kind of pandemic knocking about (get ready for scads of movies with this theme coming out over the next few years) and rangy protagonist Blake (Sam Quartin) is worried she may have been infected by her greasy boyfriend Cole (Max Madsen). Nevertheless, her plan is to rob a drugstore to liberate a life-saving drug and pass it on to some kind of underground health maintenance organisation to save other people’s lives – as if Occupy ran Obamacare, maybe. But Cole ditches her and she’s left with a young friend named Bobby (Nekhebet Kum Juch) who lost her voice. Blake and Bobby eventually meet up with a junkie named Luke (Dylan Sprouse), who happened to be in the store when they were robbing it; for no very comprehensible reason, they kidnap Luke and drag him with them to a desert commune where more spaced-out young folk are loafing around and avoiding the apocalypse. Although several characters are meant to be either smackheads or sick, they all look picturesquely skeevy, like a heroin-chic fashion spread back in the 90s. This all might have been entertaining in an on-trend retro way if the acting weren’t so dismally poor, the dialogue so banal, and the whole thing so listlessly dull as it sputters towards an outrageously dumb Usual Suspects-style twist ending. Also, the film-makers are lucky poor old William Blake’s work is out of copyright, otherwise his heirs (were any to be found) would have a good reason to sue. • Tyger Tyger is released on 28 June on digital platforms.
Unearth review – fracking horror finds something nasty under the cornfield	If HP Lovecraft had joined Extinction Rebellion, this is the kind of idea he might have come up with: a cautionary horror story about fracking, which disguises itself as a 70s ensemble drama before erupting into something altogether ickier. While Terrence Malick loved filming American cornfields at the hallowed “magic hour”, this awkward hybrid prefers loitering at what you might call “morbid hour”, with Korean cinematographer Eun-ah Lee bathing everything in sallow, deathly light. The blight beneath everyone’s feet is creeping into their hearts. Set in rural Pennsylvania, Unearth is a tale of two houses: the Lomacks and the Dolans. Beer-chugging divorcee dad George Lomack (Marc Blucas) is struggling to provide for his two daughters with a failing auto-mechanic business; dollar signs light up in his eyes when a gas-extraction outfit called Patriot Exploration comes calling with an offer for his land. This is much to the horror of Kathryn Dolan (Adrienne Barbeau, on fearsome form), matriarch of the neighbouring clan, who is fighting to keep her land productive, and whose photographer daughter Christina (Allison McAtee) likes blowing off some steam amid the corncobs with pent-up George. The film takes considerable care delving into these dynastic undercurrents, complete with a doomy biblical undertow. “If you make a tree good, its fruit will be good. You make a tree bad, its fruit’s gonna be bad,” augurs Kathryn. So makes it all the more jarring when Unearth explodes with little warning into full-on suppurating-wound, tendril-spouting eco horror for the final 20 minutes. No real explanation is apparently deemed necessary of the infection vector at hand: evil fracking. Directors John C Lyons and Dorota Swies go at the transition with gusto, including a highly disturbing episode featuring a toddler, and a nauseating demise for Barbeau worthy of her former husband, John Carpenter. But completely dropping the diligent previous character work, it becomes a directionless mess, flapping rampages through arable fields. Like the drilling operation, this was a script in sore need of a clean-up operation. • Unearth is available on digital platforms on 28 June.
Circumstantial Pleasures review – watchable weirdness and Covid prophecy	Lewis Klahr is an American artist, collagist and animator who here presents a watchably weird curation of six short pieces made between 2013 and 2019. He’s cutting and pasting images from magazines and comic-books that float, bounce and pinball around the screen. The faces of Xi, Trump and Kim Jong-un will shuffle in and out of the frame like something by Terry Gilliam, and all to an accompaniment of experimental music by Daniel Rosenboom, Tom Recchion and Scott Walker; the latter’s 2012 album Bish Bosch is used, with its strident lyrics such as: “I’ve severed my reeking gonads and fed them to your shrunken face!” Klahr’s images are often about capitalism and alienation and it’s notable how they appear to prophesy the Covid lockdown, especially the first film, Capitalist Roaders, with its images of stymied travel, scrunched and folded banknotes and people in medical masks. Perhaps the point of capitalism was that it was supposed to be internationally unfettered. In more than one film, Klahr uses the disturbing picture of the jihadi gunman who shot dead the Russian ambassador to Turkey at an Ankara art exhibition in 2016. Perhaps he couldn’t resist this image of the ultimate situationist art nightmare. Not all the films are animations. In one, High Rise, Klahr uses a single digital video shot from a train approaching Beijing showing the eerie sci-fi megacity landscape of tall buildings. It is truly desolate. Repeatedly, Klahr appears to be creating a microcircuitry of repeating patterns. And their meaning? Perhaps there is none, or none that springs easily to mind. This could just be the endlessly ramifying texture of modern life, or perhaps the texture of our media consumption of this modern life. It is opaque, sometimes eccentrically comic, but intriguing. • Circumstantial Pleasures is on Mubi from 23 June.
Fatima review – holy mother miracle retold with unbreakable faith	Picking fault with faith films on dramatic grounds is like objecting to explicit sex scenes for being “boring”. Believers may well be swept away by this glossy account of the 1917 Miracle of the Sun in Fátima, Portugal – witnessed by 30,000 people and already the subject of feature films in 1952 and 2009. But given the inherent lack of drama in the kind of unbreakable faith on display here, anyone wishing to tell the story needs to work much harder than this laboured treatment to wring any nuance, conflict or indeed true sublimity from it. To be fair, director Marco Pontecorvo – son of The Battle of Algiers’ Gillo – doesn’t disgrace himself on the latter front. There’s an undeniable sacred frisson as Mediterreanean winds caress the olive trees and invisible feet flatten the saltgrass, as the Virgin Mary first visits three young shepherds Lúcia, Jacinta and Francisco, and anoints them as her messengers. The trio quickly attract followers among a war-weary populace eager for deliverance. But others think Lucia (Stephanie Gil) is just seeking attention, including the rational-minded mayor, eager to get a public order nightmare under control, and her own devout mother Maria Rosa (Lúcia Moniz), worried her daughter’s presumptuousness will anger Him upstairs. The gathering Catholic freight train is recounted in flashback, as Harvey Keitel’s author puts up some token scepticism years later to the now Sister Lúcia – played with transfixing steadiness by Sônia Braga and who, in real life, died aged 97 in 2005. One question he poses her is why Mary would ask three young children to suffer. Indeed, insisting she knows what’s best for them, and that they keep the most challenging of her prophecies to themselves – including that two of them will die young – the Holy Mother comes across here a bit like the ultimate gaslighting parent. “Faith begins on the edges of understanding,” is the sister’s response. In truth. Fatima is too secure in its faith to subtly probe such mysteries. Pontecorvo shoots the film radiantly – including a quick CGI excursion to hell – but there is something spiritually complacent about his slickness. As the shrouded Holy Mother strolls in across the plains once again, it’s like a heavenly Scottish Widows advert offering a discount on salvation. • Fatima is released on 25 June, in cinemas and on digital platforms.
Endangered Species review – bizarrely perky safari thriller deserves a mauling	The days of Africa-set films featuring white protagonists using glowing savannas as set dressing for first-world problems seemed to be numbered, but hold on: here is a fist-bitingly self-regarding family drama with Philip Winchester and X-Men’s Rebecca Romijn as Jack and Lauren Halsey, a seemingly dream couple off on a dream safari with son Noah and daughter Zoe, and her pothead boyfriend Billy. “Penny for them,” Lauren actually says to Jack, as they are Cessna-ing in. What is on this buff oilman’s mind, though, is that he has just been put on extended leave following an industrial accident. His secret soon spills too, and Jack is so desperate to please his wife that he ignores safari-park protocol and lets them get too close to the fauna: a female rhinoceros and calf. “Wait, we shouldn’t be getting between them, right?” says Billy, a brief lapse into sensible ideas. One upended van later, with Jack’s leg gored, no mobile phone reception or water, and diabetic Lauren’s insulin levels running on empty, the Halseys find themselves in a world of hurt. If you can accept the western-centric point of view, all the ingredients are here for a dusty, merciless thriller tussling with nature in tooth and claw. But despite the horrific circumstances, Endangered Species remains inexplicably stuck in the perky comic register of a US sitcom. When it’s not attending to their trite family issues – Jack’s unease with his son’s homosexuality, plus Jack’s uptight control freakery in general – there is the Miss World-level lip service to Global Problems. “We did a project about cobalt mining in the Congo for cellphone batteries. Do you know how much violence there is, corruption, child labour?” says Noah to Billy, his musings floating out over the splendour of the veldt. A murderous CGI leopard, speaking for all of us, thankfully interrupts this conversation. A third act swerve in which man proves to be the most dangerous animal of all finally adds some real stakes and makes the realpolitik lectures finally click, thanks largely to a devilish turn from Jerry O’Connell. But there is something fundamentally naive and pious about this film. Even the final takeaway declaration on poaching oddly quotes the director MJ Bassett herself (though she did start her career as a wildlife photographer). Maybe the all-female anti-poaching squad briefly featured – based on real-life teams at work now – would have been a better prism through which to view the film’s ideas. • Endangered Species is available on digital platforms on 28 June.
Sing, Freetown review – astonishing study of creative pain and pride in Sierra Leone	Cinema is often connected to dreams and triumphs, and yet failure can make for a far more arresting subject. This astonishing documentary both demythologises the creative process and captures a tortuous artistic collaboration full of human messiness and complexity. With an evocative opening image of a man paddling a small boat towards the shore, Sing, Freetown is about returning, both physically and metaphorically. The image recalls the history of Sierra Leone as a territory where liberated Africans resettled after the slave trade was outlawed. Bafta- and Emmy-winning journalist Sorious Samura is also on his own odyssey. Weary of reporting on the poverty and civil unrest in Africa, Samura has come back to Sierra Leone, his homeland, to create a theatre piece that is positive about the nation’s pride and its rich history. Joining him is Charlie Haffner, Samura’s friend, mentor and founding figure of modern Sierra Leonean theatre. The pair encounter funding difficulties and resistance from the government. These are to be expected; what they do not predict is how the project would irretrievably puncture their relationship. Making art on the postcolonial margins is complicated. Logistical issues aside, Samura and Haffner feel not just their own insecurities heavily on their shoulders but also centuries of collective angst, guilt and hurt. The film acutely captures this intellectual and emotional turmoil: a particularly searing moment is when Samura speaks to the camera, as if in confession, about how his journalism is perhaps complicit in serving up Africa’s traumas to the consumption of the white gaze. Haffner bluntly says that his former student only makes documentaries for white people, even as he himself suffers from the spectre of a personal tragedy. All of this might sound like heavy stuff, but Sing, Freetown is a dynamic film with a deep understanding of the country’s rhythm, as well as the ebb and flow of the two men’s rapport. This is a hugely special, rewarding documentary whose ending manages to encompass both victory and loss. • Sing, Freetown is released on 25 June in cinemas.
Senior Moment review – William Shatner has still got it at 90	The basic terribleness of this film is beside the point. Everything in this film, in fact, is beside the point, save for the fact that it stars the genetic miracle of the modern age, the all-time winner of the Dorian Gray award for looking younger than your age, more impressive even than Paul Rudd … the legendary William Shatner. Shatner plays Victor Martin, a roguish old Viagra-popping womaniser who loses his driving licence after a prang. He winds up having to take the bus, where he meets-cute with a lovely lady close to his age range, cafe owner Caroline Summers, played by Jean Smart (last seen as Kate Winslet’s mum in TV’s Mare of Easttown). We actually hear what age Shatner’s character is supposed to be: 72. Fair enough. Shatner could pass for younger. But the staggering fact is he is 90. And you can easily spend the entire film hissing to yourself as you gaze awestruck at his beaming, slightly waxy but very clear face: “Ninety! He is 90! Is it special effects? Work done? A pact with Satan?” There is a fair bit of cringey stuff here, especially the gruesome opening scene in which Victor washes his beloved sports car and murmurs: “You’re a dirty girl … ” But it has to be said that sentimental regard for the great Starfleet captain turned admiral compels a certain amount of loyalty to this ridiculous nonsense. And, in fact, Shatner plays all the absurd comedy gamely enough, as indeed does Smart. The great Portuguese auteur Manoel de Oliveira continued making films until his late 90s. It could well be that Shatner will do the same. Why not a new Star Trek? • Senior Moment is released on 28 June on digital platforms
Edgar Wright and Kenneth Branagh to premiere latest at Toronto film festival	New films from Kenneth Branagh and Edgar Wright have been announced as part of this year’s Toronto film festival. The festival, which is typically seen as a major launchpad for films aiming for Oscars, will return to an in-person iteration this year after last year’s was mostly online as a result of the pandemic. Branagh’s new film Belfast, which he directed and wrote, is a semi-autobiographical tale about a working-class family in the late 60s starring Jamie Dornan and Judi Dench. “It’s about coming home – a dramatic journey of excitement, emotion and humour,” Branagh said. Wright’s eagerly anticipated thriller Last Night in Soho is the story of a young woman who encounters a portal that takes her to 1960s London. It stars Anya Taylor-Joy, Thomasin McKenzie and the late Diana Rigg. “I always like to gravitate towards making a film in genres I miss, and there’s a certain type of psychological horror film that you got more in the 60s and 70s that have something of an operatic nature,” Wright said to Empire. “I’m using that kind of visual grammar.” The two films were announced as part of a limited initial lineup consisting of just nine titles. Other premieres include The Starling, a drama starring Melissa McCarthy, and Lakewood, a thriller starring Naomi Watts. There will also be documentaries about the singers Dionne Warwick and Alanis Morissette. While in-person screenings and events will return, a digital component will remain for those unable to physically attend. “We are confident in our planning for a return to in-person screenings as part of Tiff as both the province and country accelerate vaccination rollout,” said Peter Nord, the festival’s consultative partner on health and safety for the pandemic. “Canada’s first-dose immunization rate has surpassed the US, and recently reached the best rates in the world.” Next month sees a return for the Cannes film festival with major premieres including Wes Anderson’s The French Dispatch and Sean Penn’s Flag Day while this year’s Venice film festival is set to see the first screening of Denis Villeneuve’s Dune.
Sweat review – the loneliness of the social media influencer	In theory, it should be possible to create a drama about a social media influencer and motivational fitness celebrity that isn’t all about the hidden loneliness and shame of her shallow existence. It should be possible to show such a person being a huge hit in public and perfectly content in private. But this movie from Poland-based Swedish director Magnus von Horn pretty much goes for route one, and despite some interesting touches, it promises much more in terms of shock and character insight than it ever really delivers, with some contrived and unconvincing plot transitions. Sylwia (Magdalena Koleśnik) has 600,000 followers for the Instagram account on which she obsessively posts, detailing every aspect of her day as a successful single woman, running colossally popular fitness events with her beefcake male assistant Klaudiusz (Julian Świeżewski). He clearly has a major thing for her, though at one crucial moment he shows a very implausible kind of restraint. She is living in a sleek apartment with her adorable dog, Jackson; there’s a new fitness DVD out and everything seems to be going well. But she’s recently gone viral with a video in which she tearfully confessed to wretchedness at not having a boyfriend and, far from praising her emotional honesty or caring for her mental health, Sylwia’s sponsors are hinting this is a downer and they may cancel her contract. To make things worse, Sylwia has a creepy stalker hanging out outside the apartment block and it is the birthday of her widowed mum Basia (Aleksandra Konieczna), who is hosting a party at which all the family are invited, including Sylwia’s beamingly pregnant cousin. There are some good scenes in the mix here: particularly when an old schoolfriend of Sylwia bumps into her at the mall and starts miserably confessing the grim things that are happening in her life, so different, of course, from Sylwia’s ostensible glamorous success. But this film isn’t really sure where it’s taking us and how, or if, it wants to surprise us, and the key scene with Klaudiusz doesn’t work. • Sweat is released on 25 June in cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema
The Man Standing Next review – a thrilling scramble for political power in 70s South Korea	This is a suspenseful but fiendishly complex political thriller from South Korea, which was the country’s submission for best international film for the most recent Oscars, though it didn’t make the final five shortlist. That doesn’t necessarily mean it’s not a solid film, but viewers whose introduction to Korean cinema was director Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite, which rightly won all the big prizes the year before, should be warned not to expect anything quite as audacious or accessible here. In fact, director Woo Min-ho’s drama feels aimed more at a domestic audience, covering as it does the tense days in 1979 when a military coup and an assassination determined who would ultimately come to power. Although based on actual events, a disclaimer at the beginning warns that some dramatic licence has been taken to tell the story, which was in turn based on a novel. At the centre of the story is President Park (played by Lee Sung-min), who has been the top dog for 18 years. His de facto second in command is the head of the Korean CIA, Kim Gyu-pyeong (Lee Byung-hun, excellent), a narrow-faced civil servant who shuttles diplomatically between Seoul and Washington DC, where another compatriot, Park Yong-gak (Kwak Do-won), is testifying before a US congressional committee and threatening to publish a memoir that will spill the beans about corruption in the highest ranks of the government. That’s just the start of a complex quadrille of alliances and betrayals, performed mostly in darkened, panelled rooms, as the soundtrack provides a constant percussive beat spelling doom for several figures. There’s a long wait until something really meaty happens, in every sense, but the climactic killing in a restaurant, complete with spluttering arteries and swooping camerawork, is just about worth the wait. • The Man Standing Next is released on 25 June in virtual cinemas.
Michael B Jordan renames rum after accusations of cultural appropriation	Michael B Jordan has issued an apology, in the fallout from his announcement over the weekend that he was launching a line of rums called J’Ouvert. The term signals the start of carnival in the Caribbean and is a cornerstone of tradition in Trinidad and Tobago; Jordan’s use of the word was felt by many to be cultural appropriation. Critics were particularly angered by the line in Jordan’s trademark filing that claimed the term has “no meaning in a foreign language”. An online petition to stop the trademark had already topped 12,000 signatures and the government of the islands also expressed deep concern over the plan. Singer Nicki Minaj, who comes from Trinidad, urged Jordan to change the “offensive” name on Tuesday; later that day Jordan posted an apology on Instagram Stories. “I just wanna say on behalf of myself &amp; my partners, our intention was never to offend or hurt a culture (we love &amp; respect) &amp; hoped to celebrate &amp; shine a positive light on,” he wrote. “Last few days has been a lot of listening. A lot of learning &amp; engaging in countless community conversations ...” “We hear you. I hear you &amp; want to be clear that we are in the process of renaming. We sincerely apologize &amp; look forward to introducing a brand we can all be proud of.” The term “J’Ouvert” originates from the French for daybreak; its relationship with the start of carnival in the Caribbean dates back to the 1800s. At the start of the week, the minister of trade and industry, Paula Gopee-Scoon, told Trinidad and Tobago Newsday the intellectual property implications of the filing were “of extreme concern”.
Thelma & Louise stage musical in the works	A musical based on Thelma &amp; Louise, the Oscar-winning 1991 film starring Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis, is in preparation, it has emerged. The film’s writer, Callie Khouri, told the Hollywood Reporter at a 30th anniversary screening that the project was in its “very early stages”. “We’ve got a book and we’ve got music but because of the pandemic, we haven’t all been together in a very, very long time. So, it’s still in its nascent stages, but it’s very promising.” Khouri, who won an Oscar for best original screenplay for the film, added that the musical will be “a completely different animal” from the film, which was directed by Ridley Scott, and that she had previously been reluctant to rework the movie. “There have been queries over the years, but I didn’t really want to see it. I just felt like [the film-makers] nailed it.” The film tells the story of two women who ditch their frustrating lives to go on a road trip which then turns desperate after Louise (Sarandon) kills a man who attempts to rape Thelma (Davis). It was a commercial success on its release and was nominated for six Oscars (with Khouri the only winner). In the years since, its feminist credentials have ensured it remains a cultural touchstone. According to the Hollywood Reporter, performer-playwright Halley Feiffer is writing the script for the musical, and singer-songwriter Neko Case will provide original songs, with Trip Cullman (a regular collaborator with Feiffer) due to direct.
The Filmmaker’s House review – a microcosm of British society pops round for tea	“I’m not bloody interested in serial killers, Rachel; I’m interested in ordinary human beings,” sighs veteran documentary-maker Marc Isaacs on a Skype call to his producer, who tells him programmers are only interested in sensationalist themes nowadays. Isaacs sticks to his guns. As the title implies, this inventive but flawed effort barely leaves his London terrace home. What’s less obvious, at least initially, is whether it is documentary or fiction. The eventual answer is a bit of both. Having chronicled so many aspects of Britishness in his documentary career, Isaacs contrives a sort of microcosmic state of our multicultural nation here: a gentle clash of cultural attitudes and boundaries. The dramatis personae are craftily assembled. There is a Slovakian homeless man, Mikel, whose request for a drink becomes an extended stay. Isaacs’ Colombian cleaner, Nery, who has recently lost her mother, happens to be in that day. As does his builder Keith, a textbook old, white, overweight Englishman with a passion for football and a dodgy heart. By “coincidence”, just as Nery is dealing with the cat bringing a pigeon into the house, Isaacs’ niqab-wearing Pakistani neighbour, Zara, pops round with a gift of food during Ramadan. The conversations and interactions between these people are revealing and entertaining. Their contrasting attitudes towards home, hospitality and family are thought-provoking. But there is a “structured reality” feel to proceedings which leaves us doubting their authenticity. (No serial killers turn up, but there is a brush with mortality.) These people appear to be non-actors playing themselves, but not always convincingly. This is especially true of Zara, whose readiness to explain and criticise her own culture feels implausible. Isaacs himself is a playful, self-deprecating presence, but just as the story falls between stools of fact and fiction, so his own positions as generous host, privileged employer and dispassionate observer make for a certain awkwardness. It doesn’t quite come off, but it’s a laudable attempt. • The Filmmaker’s House is released on 25 June in cinemas and on digital platforms.
Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds review – delightfully retro canine capers	This animated feature, executed mainly with 3D CGI rendering, offers a new, feature-length version of the novel The Three Musketeers but, as the title suggests, with dogs playing the leads. Yet the film is only partly based on the narrative DNA of Alexandre Dumas’ original book. The rest derives from the vintage 80s cartoon series Dogtanian, created by a Spanish production company, which told pretty much the same story but with shonkier, though immensely charming, traditional cel animation. That series was so endearing partly because the characters were pleasingly expressive in design terms, and largely faithful to the book’s iconic original characters. The Snoopy-like Dogtanian (voiced here by Tomás Ayuso), for example, a character design that persists from the series through to this film, is the talking beagle character at the story’s heart, and is recognisably similar in personality to the ingenuous, chivalrous hero in Dumas’ book. And the dog-breed characteristics of the three other Muskehounds map satisfyingly on to the original characters: effete, couplet-rapping Aramis is depicted as a foppish spaniel. Dogtanian’s love interest, Juliette (Karina Piper) is a lithe, golden coloured Afghan, the king a King Charles spaniel, and so on. This breed/species stereotyping extends throughout the Dogtanian universe with supporting villain Milady being incarnated as a slinky Siamese cat, transformed here into an ace sword fighter in a slinky cat’s catsuit, as it were, just to make her a little more empowered than the simpering, begowned schemer of the 1980s version. And here, Dogtanian’s duplicitous rodent sidekick, Pip, however, is somehow more grating and repellent, maybe because of the voice casting or the fact that he anachronistically moonwalks when excited. As with so much anthropomorphic animation, nothing explains why some species can walk upright, talk and rule the world while others, particularly horses, are still roughly the same as our real-world horses. The designs for the backgrounds in the current film perhaps lack some of the finesse of the character work, but are serviceable. All in all, there’s something delightfully retro about the whole package, particularly as it sticks doggedly, in every sense, to the raw fundamentals of Dumas’ story. • Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds is in cinemas from 25 June.
Bare review – naked dance film conceals more than it reveals	While the sight of naked flesh has always been a sensitive area in cinema history, male frontal nudity elicits especially visceral responses. In a still male-dominated industry, it is woefully normal for female bodies to be seen as mere objects of desire. In contrast, a penis on screen still triggers shock, discomfort and even a vulnerability that some viewers, along with censors, find hard to confront. Through chronicling the months-long rehearsals of a modern dance piece called Anima Ardens, for which every male dancer performs in the nude, Aleksandr M Vinogradov’s documentary aims to remove the taboos attached to the male form. Bare could have been radical, or at least intriguing, but it really is dull. This is partly due to the abstract nature of dance director Thierry Smits’ work. With an elusive ideal of masculinity in mind, he asks the dancers to perform like beasts and emphasises unsophisticated movements. At times, the troupe clearly feel frustrated, as if the piece exists in chunks rather than an emotional whole. The film’s structure is similarly unfocused. Beautiful shots of the dancers’ naked bodies contorting into abstract shapes are punctuated with millisecond-long inserts of words such as “MASCULINITY”, “WEAKNESS” and “666”, flashing on a blank screen, and snippets of classical paintings that depict male nudity. Such hollow flourishes undermine the arresting physicality of the dancers’ movements. The film’s most uncomfortable moment, however, has nothing to do with nudity. In an early audition, a dancer questions the presence of the camera and shows concerns about being filmed naked. Only then does Smits explain that a documentary is being made. That this fact was not disclosed beforehand is particularly questionable. Ironically enough, a filmed performance of Smits’ piece, also directed by Vinogradov, is available for free on Vimeo; if anything, it’s a more illuminating and poetic work on the male form. • Bare is released on 28 June on digital platforms.
Ultraviolence review – still no justice in follow-up doc on deaths in UK police custody	Twenty years in the making, Ken Fero’s Ultraviolence is the follow-up to Injustice from 2001, a documentary that is the most important British nonfiction film of my professional lifetime: a radical, passionate work about the ongoing scandal and tragedy of deaths in UK police custody, largely of black men. That film challenged the consensus and earned Fero and his co-director Tariq Mehmood nothing but obstruction from the authorities. The police federation threatened him with writs and the terrestrial broadcasters nervously shied away. Nowadays, it is precisely these establishment figures who have learned to make blandly respectful noises at the mention of Black Lives Matter and George Floyd. But for decades, Fero has been telling them that it’s been happening right here, in the UK, under their noses. Between 1969 and 1999, a thousand people died in police custody without prosecution, and the situation has carried on in the 21st century. Injustice talked about the heartwrenching cases of Paul Coker, Christopher Alder and many more: black men whose initial arrest on some minor matter of disorder spiralled into ugly violence, brutal subjection techniques, death and cover-up within the walls of the police station. Fero has here given us an update: grimly, it is a case of more of the same: more deaths, more protests, more waffle from the Independent Office for Police Conduct, more press conferences, more stonewalling that leads the angry grieving families up endless flights of the Escher staircase. Now, the film itself is undoubtedly a bit raw and rough round the edges: it does not have the smooth gloss of a bigger budget film on a safer subject. In its way, Ultraviolence is protest cinema, underground cinema, with big rhetorical gestures and Godardian intertitles that come straight from the 1960s. And on a personal level, I can’t sign up to George Galloway as an expert witness in the way this film does. But the new video footage Fero now has, taken from police station CCTV, is horrifying. This makes every other documentary look obtuse and irrelevant. • Ultraviolence is released on 25 June in cinemas, and on 5 July on BFI Player. • Join a Guardian Live discussion looking at the global impact one year on from the murder of George Floyd. With Oliver Laughland and a panel of global activists including Rokhaya Diallo, Gacheke Gachihi and Rina Odula. On Wednesday 30 June, 7pm BST | 8pm CEST | 11am PDT | 2pm EDT. Book tickets here
Sweat review – behind the scenes of the Insta influencer	We’re used to seeing social media stars from a particular vantage point: the ring-lit, face-on front camera of their mobile phones. Swedish writer-director Magnus von Horn’s shrewd second feature, about a fictional Polish fitness influencer, Sylwia (Magdalena Koleśnik), constantly readjusts its angle. Michal Dymek’s frenetic, often handheld camera examines Sylwia in extreme closeup, looking at her sideways and tracking her from behind. She is beautiful, adored and alone. She doesn’t have friends or sex or “eat cake”. Yet the film is not a straightforward send-up; it shows compassion for Sylwia and her search for self-definition – for her loneliness and her labour, its drudgery and its physical strain. Von Horn understands the gap between Sylwia’s authenticity online – mediated through the safety of a screen – and the intimacy her followers feel entitled to in real life. After a video post in which she cries about being single goes viral, an old classmate opens up to her about a miscarriage, while a middle-aged man, Rysiek (Tomasz Orpinski), stalks her outside her apartment. Sylwia isn’t emotionally equipped for either. In cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema
Triumph review – RJ Mitte grapples with sporting ambition in the wrestling ring	With actors with disabilities often confined to supporting roles, Triumph could have been a breath of fresh air. Centring on the rarely seen athletic journey of a character with a motor disorder, this underdog, coming-of-age sports movie has a big heart but lacks the competency to execute its aspirational premise. Mike (RJ Mitte) is a handsome high school freshman with a particularly disarming smile. He dreams of joining the wrestling team; however, because he has cerebral palsy, the obstacles are numerous. Not only does Mike endure jeers and bullying from other students, his caring but overly protective father also attempts to dissuade him from participating in organised sports. In the face of such hurdles, Mike fortunately has the unwavering support of the tough-but-fair Coach Cutting (Terrence Howard) and his new best friend/star athlete Jeff (Colton Haynes). With each arduous session of training, Mike not only grows as an athlete but also acquires timeless life lessons. Inspired by the teenage years of screenwriter Michael D Coffey, who grew up with cerebral palsy, the film does strive for authenticity, especially in terms of casting. Best known for playing Walter White Jr in Breaking Bad, Mitte has the condition himself, and infuses a rather thinly written character with a lot of tenacity and charisma. In fact, though based on truth, the story feels more like a sports film checklist, restlessly jumping from one cliche to another with little emotional weight. In contrast to Mitte’s committed performance, Howard pretty much phones it in with a near monotonous line reading; the cinematography is also particularly distracting, with a penchant for a halo-like effect that obscures the characters’ faces and proves especially ill-suited during wrestling sequences where the athletes’ bodies become blurry rather than powerful. This might work as an OK family-friendly watch, but good intentions are not enough to make a good movie. • Triumph is released on 28 June on digital platforms.
Sparkling: The Story of Champagne review – a fine aperitif for the summer	Irish film producer and distribution executive Frank Mannion makes a genial host and guide to this polished survey of the highest of high-end sparkling wines; it’s entertaining in itself to watch Mannion gulping down giant goblets of the vintage under the guise of interviewing the heads of various champagne houses. There’s very much a wine-tour atmosphere to this documentary, particularly in the first half as Mannion wanders from one vineyard HQ to another, most of them located in gleaming perfume-factory type cubes perched oddly in the French countryside. If you ever thought champagnes were pretty much the same, whatever the label, well, this parade of beautifully turned-out old school champagne-makers will put you straight on the difference between Veuve Cliquot, Pol Roger, Bollinger, and the rest. In the middle section, Mannion’s attention turns to the beverage’s successful attempts to market itself internationally – “Champagne Charlie”, AKA Charles Heidsieck of Piper Heidsieck renown, appears to be the key figure here – as well as the way champagne has smartly inserted itself into top-end entertainment and sporting events, from James Bond to Wimbledon, to keep its glamour ratings high. In the final third, the focus changes to British attempts to get into the sparkling wine game; and if Mannion throughout is generally happy to let business owners do their marketing spiel at considerable length, in this last bit it goes into overdrive: it’s practically a longform advert for English sparkling wine estates such as Bolney, Wiston and Hush Heath. And although the “B” word – Brexit – doesn’t get a mention, there’s still an edge to the jolly home counties joshing of the French wine-makers in the British gun sights over who actually invented the stuff. (Slightly less jolly is the chuckling over global heating that may give British vintners a bit of assistance over the next few years.) Be that as it may, this is a warm-hearted, pleasant film, full of enthusiasm for its subject; a fine aperitif for the summer. • Sparkling: The Story of Champagne is released on 25 June in cinemas.
Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds review – swashbuckling for the very young	The popular 1980s animated TV series has been given a CGI update, with gallant, sword-wielding hero Dogtanian (Tomas Ayuso) now rendered in plasticky, squidgy 3D. A riff on Alexandre Dumas’s Three Musketeers, the young Dogtanian journeys from 17th-century Béarn to Paris in the hope of becoming one of Louis XIII’s guard dogs – a “muskehound” – and clearing his disgraced father’s name. There’s a diamond heist and a gruff-voiced, double-crossing mouse. In this cartoon universe, dogs ride horses and walk on their hind legs; cats such as Milady de Winter (Elisabeth Gray) wear corsets and are, of course, evil. The film’s world of Beauty and the Beast-style pastel houses and swashbuckling masculinity is unsophisticated, if not totally unenjoyable, and clearly geared towards very young children.
Mary J Blige’s My Life review – a superficial spin with the soul queen	What a brilliant idea: to examine a famous artist’s long career through the lens of a single record. This documentary takes US hip-hop and soul queen Mary J Blige’s canonical 1994 album, My Life, as its starting point. Archive footage of Blige growing up in Yonkers soon gives way to the now 50-year-old’s generic reflections on the themes of self-love and depression. The film is padded out with toothless interviews with her celebrity friends and colleagues (including P Diddy, Alicia Keys, Nas and the actor Taraji P Henson) and dispiritingly literal animated inserts. Footage of recent concerts and meet and greets is included to showcase both her imperious glamour and how far she’s come, yet we never really get a sense of where she’s been, let alone My Life’s musical and cultural context. • Available on Amazon Prime only
Fatima review – miracle movie plays down the transcendence	“Not everything unexplainable is necessarily transcendent,” insists Professor Nichols (Harvey Keitel), an atheist doing research for his latest book. “I can only give you my testimony,” replies Sônia Braga’s Sister Lúcia. Marco Pontecorvo’s gentle historical drama takes the real-life Portuguese nun’s account of the Miracle of the Sun in 1917 as its inspiration. Against the backdrop of the first world war, he focuses on the perspectives of 10-year-old Lúcia dos Santos (Stephanie Gil) and her younger cousins Francisco (Jorge Lamelas) and Jacinta (Alejandra Howard), who claim they have been visited by the “Angel of Peace” (Joana Ribeiro) in their hometown of Fátima. Lúcia is treated with scepticism by those around her, including her mother, Maria (Lúcia Moniz), and the town’s secular mayor (Goran Visnjic). Most of the film takes place in sepia-tinged flashback, which creates an atmosphere of dour sobriety instead of evoking any sort of divine radiance. Pontecorvo seems particularly interested in conveying the gravitas of Lúcia’s spiritual burden, which is anchored by Gil, who is full of quiet intensity and impressive conviction.
Fast & Furious 9 review – Vin Diesel back at the wheel of an overheated vehicle	Vin Diesel’s street racer turned special agent Dominic Toretto has declared he’s “not on call any more”, but with Charlize Theron’s cyberterrorist Cipher still at large, and in pursuit of a mysterious satellite device with the ability to “reboot the world order”, he might not have much of a choice. Worse still, his estranged little brother, Jakob (John Cena, “the useless one” to Dom’s golden boy), has teamed up with self-declared “spoiled rich prick” Otto (Thue Ersted Rasmussen) and is after the device too. Grainy flashbacks to their father’s death in 1989 create context for their bitter rivalry. Prior acquaintance with the eight previous instalments of this colossal action movie franchise isn’t necessary for enjoyment of this one – the film’s muscle cars and maximalist approach continue to serve it well. A set piece in the fictional Central American country of Montequinto, involving exploding landmines and an unlikely voyage across a rickety rope bridge, is a wild ride, but subsequent car chases in London, Edinburgh and Tokyo provide diminishing returns, stalling the almost two-and-a-half-hour running time. There’s a tongue-in-cheek attitude towards the silliness of the series’ death- (and logic- and gravity-) defying stunts. “How are you still alive?!” gawps tech whiz Tej (Ludacris) as buddy Roman (Tyrese Gibson) emerges jelly-legged from a car wreck. It’s a question I’d also like to ask after their trip to space in a modified Pontiac Fiero.
Witch Hunt review – a downright offensive attempt at political horror	An unfortunate effect of Jordan Peele’s masterly Get Out is the recent slew of horror flicks that have also attempted to double as explicit social commentary, yet end up either ineffective or tone-deaf. The slavery horror Antebellum is a prime example, as is the cringey trailer for the forthcoming Karen. And now we have this extremely clumsy film that hinges on the premise of a modern, dystopian US where magic exists but is outlawed. The film opens with the literal and metaphorical definitions of “witch-hunt” being typed across a blank screen, so all hopes of subtlety fly out the window. The story explores a young girl’s growing pains amid the legal and social persecution of witches. High schooler Claire (Gideon Adlon) tries to fit in with her prejudiced friends while hiding her own fearful secret: her mother is a part of an Underground Railroad-like system that helps the witches cross into Mexico for asylum. Initially resentful of the operation, Claire confronts her own intolerance after developing a friendship with two orphaned young witches whose mother is burned at the stake. Like a lot of low-budget horror movies, the VFX aren’t great; this would not necessarily be a problem if the film had crafted an atmosphere of actual suspense. Instead, random horror elements – jump scares and the like – are inserted into a story that would have worked better as a thriller. The political commentary is on even shakier ground: the film appropriates images of real-life oppression against people of colour, such as border patrol buses taking the undocumented to detention centres, but the witches are invariably white women – it is not only careless but downright offensive. Though examining how women’s bodies are controlled and surveilled by the state – there’s a scene where Claire is subjected to a medical examination for witch moles – such points ring grossly hollow. All in all, this is a horror that’s neither clever nor scary. • Witch Hunt is released on 5 July on digital platforms.
Lapsis review – sci-fi satire targets the gig economy	This sensitive but flawed sci-fi comic dystopia walks the strange new frontier of the modern gig economy that has also been explored by Ken Loach’s Sorry We Missed You and Nomadland. It takes place, like Boots Riley’s Sorry to Bother You, in an innocuous present tinged with an Instagram-filter of light futurism. And it is driven by a similar sly ideological fury as Sorry to Bother You – only it is even more absurdist and, crucially, not as funny. A rare case of an actor whose real name fits the role even better, Dean Imperial plays Ray, an old-school denizen of New York – complete with wifebeater and tinted shades – forced to seek out lucrative new work in order to put his brother Jamie (Babe Howard) into a clinic to receive treatment for a weird fatigue syndrome called Omnia. Despite being a technophobe who shuns the quantum computing revolution sweeping the world, he accepts work as a contractor laying “quantum cable” in remote areas for comms giant CABLR. Signing on to the app that assigns him routes, grinning and bearing the patronising tech-empowerment speak (“Challenge your status quo!”), Ray starts getting dirty looks from his co-workers when he reveals the username that has been assigned to him: Lapsis Beeftech. Director Noah Hutton (who has a documentary background but makes his full-length fiction debut here) makes the main play an almost dadaist joke. Dictated partly by the budget, no doubt, it is that this 21st-century hi-tech revolution looks so lo-fi: the contractors literally unspool cable in the wilderness, re-supplied by drops from drones. Even the spindly legged robots who CABLR force them to compete with look like something you might have bought in the 1990s Argos catalogue. It’s more eccentric than funny, though, and the limited plausibility eventually blunts the edge of the social satire Hutton is aiming at. Instead, during a middle section that consists of little more than Ray trudging down forest paths, the director leans too much on polemical rants about exploitation from his co-workers. The fuzzy premise picks up momentum in the last third, as, thanks to activist colleague Anna (Madeline Wise), more is revealed about the history of Ray’s controversial avatar. Lapsis is admirably fired-up film-making, and certainly original, but – like many revolutions – gets bogged down as it fusses over the details. • Lapsis is released on digital platforms on 5 July.
The Place of No Words review – a dying father’s magical travels with his son	This film is a charming family affair. Director Mark Webber stars with his wife Teresa Palmer and their son Bodhi, in a magical realist story that feels at once awe-inspiring and intimate. A dying father struggles to communicate to his young son about matters of life and death and, through storytelling, the parents concoct a fantastical tale of a Viking father-and-son duo who go on adventures and encounter mysterious creatures, all while wearing enormous fur coats. The film ingeniously alternates between a cramped hospital room and the vast, lush imaginary world where the father is no longer confined to his sickbed but instead roams around with his son on heroic quests. Patrice Lucien Cochet’s cinematography is especially inspiring in the Viking portion: the sombre grey sky, the rocky paths, the patches of green moss, all come beautifully together and add an austerity to the quirky details of this magical world. The childlike nature of the quests is endearing, as the pair waddle through a farting swamp or cross paths with monsters that sneeze massive snots. The visuals in these segments are impressive, yet the content is wonderfully attuned to the kind of impromptu stories that parents tell their children before bedtime. The film’s weakness lies in the “reality” sequences; in contrast to the engaging playfulness of the magical scenes, the scenes between the grownups are overly maudlin. Bodhi Palmer is still the one adorable constant: within a relatively freeform story and in the company of his parents, Bodhi doesn’t even seem to perform. He just is, and it is a joy to watch. • The Place of No Words is released on 5 July on digital platforms.
White on White review – a damning snapshot of South American colonisation	Colonisation does not come off well in this sparse and striking drama, set in snowbound 19th-century Tierra del Fuego. It’s a sombre study of the corrupted values and decayed morals that enabled a genocide; it centres on a photographer who considers himself superior to the coarse white settlers around him, but is really part of the same system. This is Pedro (Alfredo Castro), a middle-aged loner who has been brought to this end-of-the-world location to take the wedding portrait of Mr Porter, the big landowner. But when he arrives, Mr Porter is nowhere to be found; only his bride, Sara, who looks little older than a teenager. In an early, uncomfortable scene, Pedro blithely “arranges” Sara into what he considers an attractive pose, pulling her wedding dress off her shoulders, ostensibly for the groom’s benefit: “He’ll like it better this way.” The scene is to be reprised even more excruciatingly later on, after Pedro takes a shine to Sara and sets up a more “artistic” photoshoot. Pedro doesn’t find much else to appreciate here. In Mr Porter’s absence, he is consigned to an extended stay among the (overwhelmingly male) settlers, whose exploits he dignifies with his camera but whose company he shuns – initially, at least. These Europeans are making their first inroads into this landscape: erecting houses, putting up fences, and killing and kidnapping the indigenous population. They are paid according to the number of human ears they bring back. “Think of it as humanitarian work,” one of them tells Pedro. Director Théo Court does a fine job of capturing the barren beauty of this landscape and using it to suggest the broader moral vacuum. There are contrasts between the blinding daytime brightness and pitch-black nights, human figures are reduced to ant-like presences in the vast expanses. At times, though, the storytelling is a little too distant, and the narrative momentum falters. Perhaps conscious of the issues of representation he is dealing with, Court invites us to come to our own conclusions rather than spoon-feeding us a point of view. • White on White is released on 30 June on Mubi.
Embattled review – oddly compelling and nuanced cage fighting family drama	Part classic montage-showdown sports movie, part southern gothic Oedipal family drama, this decidedly peculiar but oddly compelling film is the proverbial curate’s egg. The plot revolves around the fraught relationship between a mixed martial arts cage fighting champion named Cash Boykins (Stephen Dorff, a sinewy mass here of cut muscle, tattoos and barely controlled rage) and his semi-estranged 18-year-old son Jett (newcomer Darren Mann, more than holding his own). In possession of a much finer soul than his old man, high-school senior Jett lives in a modest suburban house with his waitress mother Susan (Elizabeth Reaser) who divorced Cash a while back, and younger brother Quinn (Colin McKenna, delightful), a sweet, cheeky kid who happens to have Williams syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects physical and mental development. Jett has a weird, semi-professional relationship with Cash, having been groomed to be the next MMA in the family by the domineering patriarch, but there’s deep reservoir of hurt between them due to the fact that Cash used to beat Susan and treated Quinn, whose disability he couldn’t accept, with appalling cruelty. Outwardly, Cash revels in obnoxious, macho swagger, indicated in the very first scene wherein he discusses his penis size at length. Plus, a good white son of Alabama, he loves to spout sexist, racist hate speech even though he’s currently married to Jade (Karrueche Tran), a biracial woman with whom he’s had another son. But screenwriter David McKenna and director Nick Sarkisov take pains to indicate Cash’s own past as an abused child. Still, that doesn’t stop him from pushing Jett to take part in an unlikely-to-happen-in-the real-world fight with him, for a pay-per-view audience, that’s filmed with brio but at numbing length in the last quarter of the film’s running time. Personally, I felt less engaged here by the fisticuffs than by the surprisingly nuanced and insightful portrait – viewed through Jett’s and Susan’s eyes – of what it’s like to have a disabled member of the family, particularly for a sibling. It’s here that Mann really comes into his own and displays an acting range more impressive than his stunt work in the fight scenes. Also, Donald Faison is utterly charming as a paraplegic veteran turned special needs teacher who represents a possible suitor for Susan. • Embattled is released on 5 July on digital platforms.
A Perfect Enemy review – devious Euro-thriller with the manic pixie dream girl from hell 	“Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.” That’s the Saint-Exupéry zinger with which star architect Jeremiasz (Cold War’s Tomasz Kot) closes a Paris lecture, after describing his conversion to designing buildings with a social purpose. But the unsound psychological foundations, and the cost, of perfectionism are the theme of this well-written, devious Euro-thriller. Grabbing a taxi to catch a flight back to Poland, Jeremiasz lets improbably named twentysomething Texel Textor (Athena Strates) hop along for the ride. She’s so intent on chatting that she leaves her luggage on the street, and both of them end up missing their flights. Jeremiasz settles in for a two-hour wait in the Charles de Gaulle airport extension that, in this reality, he designed, but inevitably bumps into Texel again. He tries to give her the cold shoulder, but, after she makes an alarming admission and insists she tells him her story, he consents to being her captive audience. Both Strates and Catalan director Kike Maíllo – eager to make this dysfunctional fabulism fly – overplay a bit in the opening stages. But the film soon settles into an engrossing power game, as Jeremiasz tries to work out what this manic pixie dream girl from hell wants from him. Recounting how she once apparently successfully wished death on a classmate in the Netherlands, she admits to being possessed by a destructive spirit: “the perfect enemy”. Forming a perfect cornice with Jeremiasz’s preoccupations, it’s not the only hint that their pasts are directly linked. Strates, who physically resembles Carey Mulligan in Promising Young Woman, makes Texel into an almost endearing antagonist: rascally, obsessive and haunted. Maíllo, making his English-language debut, effortlessly sustains the tension and sprinkles in some dinky visual touches, like the architectural model of the airport in which miniatures of Jeremiasz and Texel, and ominous blood splatter, appear. Thriller perfection is not too far away. • A Perfect Enemy is available on digital platforms on 5 July.
