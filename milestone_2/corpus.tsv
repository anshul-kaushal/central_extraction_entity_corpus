In print, DC Comics was the trailblazer for superheroes more than 80 years ago – while Marvel emerged as a 1960s enfant terrible, shaking up the genre by humanising its costumed crime-fighters and engaging with the emerging counterculture. On the big screen, despite mainstays such as Superman and Batman having made it to the multiplex long before Iron Man, the Hulk and Thor, DC Films has found itself playing catch-up following the astounding success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a superhero sandpit in which scores of mega-powered titans have been able to play for more than a decade now. This picture doesn’t seem likely to change any time soon, following news that DC, owned by Warner Bros, is to move even more of its content to the streaming platform HBO Max. Industry reports suggest four movies a year will now be released in cinemas, and two will be released straight to the small screen. While the move has come in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and the effect on cinema chains, it also looks a lot like Marvel’s activity at Disney+, where the studio is bringing multiple TV shows and movies featuring its core roster from the MCU over the next two years. DC’s current release, Wonder Woman 1984, is debuting on HBO Max and in cinemas in the US, while the studio plans to bring the Zack Snyder cut of Justice League to the streaming service in 2021 as a miniseries of four one-hour episodes. Surely more TV projects will follow. Is it too much to suggest that being forced to produce for the small screen might iron out some of the worst wrinkles in the DC Extended Universe project, if that is even a thing any more following the failure of the original Justice League and movies such as Suicide Squad and Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice to pass muster? While DC’s movies have improved over the past two years, largely as a result of Warner Bros allowing film-makers to go their own way rather than being forced to follow the Marvel-style format of interlinked superhero stories, there is something about film-making for the multiplex that makes it easier for movies such as Suicide Squad and Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice to exist. Watching these films at the cinema is like eating a burger made from the cheapest cuts of meat that has been slavered in delicious, home-made dressings and placed between gorgeous hand-crafted brioche buns along with the most excellent of pickles by a Michelin-starred chef. Multiplexes, with their high-quality screens and audio, significantly paper over any film-making cracks. By contrast, it is hard to imagine the worst DC movies finding audiences on TV, because those massive special effects-laden sequences don’t work well when viewed at home on an iPad. Even Warner has had the sense to split Snyder’s Justice League into episodes, a move that hopefully might lead the studio to tone down its tendency for every third act to feature a knuckle-headed mega-battle between our heroes and the latest hellish, creation imagined by the guys in the CGI lab (always against the backdrop of a ravaged, fiery landscape, for some reason). For all its faults, Wonder Woman 1984 shows encouraging signs that the DC special effects team have learned that going big doesn’t always deliver the loudest bang. Yet even if Diana’s final battle against Kristen Wiig’s Cheetah doesn’t descend into a pixel-fest, there is still something weak about the digital work on the feline villain compared to say, Marvel’s spectacular rendition of Thanos in the later Avengers movies. I’m not the only observer to think that there is an unfortunate whiff of Cats about it. What would a Wonder Woman movie made for TV look like? We can only hope that without the hi-tech upscaling provided by a theatrical release, DC film-makers will go back to basics. With luck, 2021 might even usher in a new era of comic-book film and television where the focus is on storytelling superpowers rather than the kind of movie experience that feels as if we’ve been repeatedly battered on the head with Snyder-esque heavy metal “spectacle”.	774
Desperately Seeking Susan Out with the old, in with the new: suburban housewife puts on groovy jacket and learns that life isn’t all picket fences and ironing. In Susan Seidelman’s 1985 comedy, bored Roberta (Rosanna Arquette) lives vicariously through enigmatic drifter Susan (Madonna), whose messages she reads in the personal ads. Her obsession leads to an appropriation of Susan’s lacy, trashy aesthetic – and liberation. Amazon Prime Video (£) Easy A When Emma Stone’s squeaky-clean Olive Penderghast tells a fib about losing her virginity in Will Gluck’s 2010 high-school comedy, her reputation takes a nosedive.

Don’t mind if we do. If there is one thing better than Jack Dawson as a grubby, below-deck ragamuffin, it’s the spruced-up version in black tie nervously waiting at the bottom of the grand staircase for raft-hogger extraordinaire Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) in James Cameron’s 1997 movie. Now TV Superman The original Clark Kent, played by Christopher Reeve in Richard Donner’s 1978 superhero film, looked cute in his wonky specs and crumpled suit, but it took a pair of red underpants and a dinky kiss curl for Lois Lane to see the man that he truly was. Admittedly, his ability to fly probably helped. Now TV Gigi A Parisian playboy forms a friendship with a 15-year-old girl, only to realise he loves her, in this Vincente Minnelli musical from 1958. Nowadays, Louis Jourdan’s Gaston would be looking at prison time but, as Gigi, Leslie Caron is delightful, illustrating her transition to adulthood with a luminous satin gown. Available on DVD Mrs Doubtfire Chris Columbus’s 1993 comedy stars Robin Williams as a divorced, out-of-work actor who loses custody of his kids and dresses up as an elderly Scottish housekeeper in order to hang out with them.

Disney+ Overboard Makeover films like to empower their female characters by putting them in a pretty frock. Not 1987’s Overboard, which transforms Goldie Hawn’s pampered heiress into a dirt-poor housewife. If you overlook the small matter of Kurt Russell having kidnapped Hawn and installed her as his domestic slave, it’s a lot of fun. Digital platforms (£) Pretty Woman The “rich dude rescues downtrodden hooker” plot hasn’t aged well, and we all know Julia Roberts looked better in thigh-high leather boots than her later fusty lady-about-town outfits.

It’s the “last day in paradise” for Las Vegas dive bar the Roaring ’20s, which will shut permanently after the evening’s festivities. Over the next 18 hours, as the booze begins to flow, there are several slurred flirtations and a fight. Inevitably, at least one person takes their top off. The film is directed by Bill and Turner Ross (known for their documentaries 45365 and Tchoupitoulas), and shot fly-on-the-wall style. But elements of this riotous hybrid documentary are staged. The Roaring ’20s is actually in New Orleans, not Vegas, with characters street-cast, and playing fictionalised versions of themselves. Yet the sense of the watering hole as a haven for lost souls – not to mention the threat of gentrification to civic space – couldn’t be more vérité. Inside the bar, red fairylights give a rose-tinted glow. The film’s mood is bittersweet, never more so than in a scene that shows the revellers trailing into the car park to set off fireworks, depicted via grainy security camera footage. Sophie B Hawkins’s 1992 track Damn, I Wish I Was Your Lover (a pop song about bearing witness to an abusive relationship) plays softly from the jukebox inside. Martin, a regular, hovers by the bar, watching Hollywood western The Misfits. Like Eli Wallach’s Guido, whose voice can be heard on the TV, he’s “just looking for a place to hide and watch it all go by”.	286
Joan Micklin Silver, the American film-maker best known for the Jewish-inflected romcom Crossing Delancey and the largely Yiddish-language immigrant romance Hester Street, has died aged 85. The New York Times reported that Silver’s daughter Claudia said the cause of death was vascular dementia. Silver was both one of the few female directors operating in US cinema in the 1970s, as well as one of the few film-makers that tackled specifically Jewish material – still a rarity in a Hollywood that had traditionally been dominated by Jewish figures in production and studio roles. Having made a series of documentary shorts and gained a credit as a writer on the Hollywood picture Limbo (1972), about the wives of soldiers serving in Vietnam, Silver attempted to get her feature debut off the ground. Hester Street, adapted from Abraham Cahan’s novel Yekl, detailed the experiences of Yiddish-speaking immigrants to New York; it was named after the street that was then part of the Jewish Lower East Side. Hollywood studios were notoriously reluctant at the time to back a female director; instead the film, which provided an early role for Carol Kane, was produced by Silver’s real-estate developer husband Raphael, who raised over $300,000 for the budget. Cleverly evoking the style of 1930s Yiddish cinema, with black and white visuals and melodramatic acting, Hester Street was an indie hit on its release in 1975, making back its budget several times over. After a TV movie based on the F Scott Fitzgerald story Bernice Bobs Her Hair, Silver and her husband teamed up for her second feature, Between the Lines, about the struggles of an alternative newspaper based in Boston that is taken over by a conglomerate. Released in 1977, its cast featured a list of future major names, including Jeff Goldblum, John Heard, Lindsay Crouse and Marilu Henner. Silver’s third film, a 1979 adaptation of Ann Beattie’s novel ‘Chilly Scenes of Winter, marked a step upwards in financial terms, with backing from Hollywood studio United Artists, but it proved a troubled experience; it became something of a sleeper hit after the original upbeat ending and title were both dispensed with. Silver marked time with more TV movies until she returned to features in 1988 with what remains her best known film: Crossing Delancey. Like her debut, it was set in the Lower East Side, and also revolved around a female protagonist experiencing the push-pull of tradition and assimilation; the film’s star is Amy Irving, then married to Steven Spielberg. Crossing Delancey shares considerable DNA with When Harry Met Sally, released a year later, as well as the TV sitcom Seinfeld, which also began its nine-year run in 1989. Thereafter Silver directed middling Hollywood comedies such as Loverboy and Big Girls Don’t Cry … They Get Even. Television provided more fertile territory, with a string of productions including the Warsaw ghetto drama In the Presence of Mine Enemies (1997), starring Armin Mueller-Stahl and Charles Dance and eating disorder drama Hunger Point (2003), with Barbara Hershey and Christina Hendricks, which became Silver’s final credit.	585
Sylvie (Tessa Thompson) has been taught by her mother to stand tall, shoulders back and chin lifted, like a proper lady. Unobserved, she’s considerably looser, freer, grooving to Bill Haley’s See You Later, Alligator in the back of her father’s record store. It’s this uninhibited joy that catches the eye of struggling jazz saxophonist Robert (NFL player turned actor Nnamdi Asomugha) in Eugene Ashe’s glossy period romance. Set in Harlem between 1957 and 1962, the lusty spark between the pair combusts despite Sylvie’s engagement to the more respectable Lacy (Alano Miller). An unexpected pregnancy and a career-making gig in Paris are further obstacles. Thompson and Asomugha have great chemistry, but the film stalls a little in the second half, when the focus pivots towards the couple’s careers. Like Barry Jenkins’s If Beale Street Could Talk and Todd Haynes’s Carol, Ashe takes the form of the 50s melodrama and recentres it on characters the genre has tended to ignore. This isn’t as politically restless as those films – it’s less interested in subverting the “woman’s picture” than establishing itself as one. In the same way that Saul Leiter’s photographs of New York were a visual reference point for Carol, cinematographer Declan Quinn draws inspiration from Gordon Parks’s photo essays for Life magazine. The period costuming is also a dream, with Thompson as striking as any Golden Age heroine in a teal Chanel gown and white elbow-length gloves. Sylvie’s Love is on Amazon Prime	302
He was detained in Guantánamo Bay for 14 years without charge or trial, and wrote a bestselling memoir about his captivity and torture, which included sleep deprivation and beatings. Now Mohamedou Ould Slahi’s story will be told in a forthcoming feature film whose reconstruction of the US detention centre is so realistic that he became visibly distressed when he saw it. Kevin Macdonald, the award-winning director of the film, titled The Mauritanian, said: “He came to the Guantánamo set. He was quite upset by it, so we didn’t let him stay very long. “When he is pushed to remember, either by talking or being in that environment, a physical change comes over him. I’m not a psychologist but I can see he’s got PTSD, and it’s a very physical thing. He starts to do strange things with his face. You can just see that he’s not comfortable. He was fidgety, and didn’t want to be there. Who can blame him?” He added: “He’s incredibly warm, funny and clever, but when he talks about the dark things that happened in Guantánamo, the mistreatment, the psychological and physical torture, he changes. He goes back there, he starts certain ticks and things in his face and in his mannerisms, you can see that he really is going straight back there and then he can find it quite hard to come out again.” Macdonald’s acclaimed films include Touching the Void, the epic mountaineering adventure, The Last King of Scotland, inspired by Ugandan tyrant Idi Amin, and State of Play, the political thriller. In The Mauritanian – to be released in February – Tahar Rahim, the French-Algerian star of the prison thriller A Prophet, portrays Slahi. Jodie Foster plays his lawyer, Nancy Hollander, and Benedict Cumberbatch is military prosecutor Lt Colonel Stuart Couch. Slahi, born in Mauritania in 1970, was held at Guantánamo between 2002 and 2016. He had sworn allegiance to al-Qaida during the 1980s Afghanistan insurrection, although he claimed that he later renounced them and denied involvement with terrorism. An administrative review eventually determined that he did not pose a “continuing significant threat to the security of the United States”. While in detention, he wrote his Guantánamo Diary, describing the physical and psychological torture: “I started to hallucinate and hear voices as clear as crystal… Later on, the guards used these hallucinations and started talking with funny voices through the plumbing, encouraging me to hurt the guard and plot an escape. But I wasn’t misled by them.” He claimed to have been driven to making false confessions to end the torment, telling his interrogators that he planned to blow up the CN Tower in Toronto. Asked if he was telling the truth, he replied: “I don’t care as long as you are pleased.” Macdonald’s research included interviewing Hollander: “I said to her, ‘Are you 100% sure he’s innocent?’ because a lot of the film is about her deciding whether he’s innocent or not. She said: ‘After the millions of dollars the American government spent researching every aspect of his life, torturing him and lie-detector testing him, don’t you think some evidence would have come up?’ She won’t say definitively that he never did anything wrong. “He joined al-Qaida when he was 18 or 19. He felt that he had to stop the Soviets in this instance killing fellow Muslims. He didn’t know which group it was. Turned out that they were al-Qaida. He never fought because the war with the Soviets was over. Did he sometimes have ideas that he shared with jihadists? Maybe. But just because you believe something momentarily doesn’t mean you’re a criminal.” Macdonald sought to portray Slahi’s torture “mostly through suggestion. He’s beaten up, he’s force-fed, but it’s done in a way that is, I hope, palatable for an audience. We made the decision to try to make it about the psychological effect rather than seeing things physically… “The one area which is, as far as we were able to make it, absolutely accurate is his treatment from when he arrived to the end – and what the cell looked like, how cold the air-conditioning was, where the toilet was in relation to where he could pray, and the way his shackles were done up.” He added: “It’s not a political film. It’s a humanistic film.” Despite everything, Slahi has kept his sense of humour and even keeps in touch with one of his guards, Macdonald said: “They’re great friends. They speak each week on Zoom.” Foster said: “I was drawn in by the emotional story first, Mohamedou’s awful journey. It’s hard to imagine how a human could endure that, being taken from his home, blindfolded, imprisoned, subjected to years and years of psychological and physical abuse without any explanation whatsoever.”	975
The extended single-shot take is a powerful weapon in the film-maker’s arsenal. Without the punctuation of an edit or the breathing space of a change of angle, the single shot demands unwavering audience participation. It grabs us by the throat and doesn’t let go. It’s a device that is abused at least as frequently as it is used effectively: for every blisteringly kinetic action sequence from Children of Men, there is the showy plumage of something like Birdman. But rarely have I seen a single shot used as arrestingly as the 23-minute sequence near the beginning of Kornél Mundruczó’s Pieces of a Woman. Hours of labour; the traumatic home birth of the baby of Martha (the remarkable Vanessa Kirby) and Sean (Shia LaBeouf); the way time compresses and stretches with each contraction; the devastating blunt force of tragedy that comes shortly after birth: all of this is condensed into a woozy, disorienting, umbilical unbroken take. It is not a spoiler to reveal that the film deals with neonatal death: its seismic impact on lives; the impossibility of making sense of it, of anything, in the aftermath. It’s a subject to which Mundruczó (White God) and his writer and partner, Kata Wéber, have a personal connection, something that is evident in the deft balance between sensitivity of approach, and an unflinching eye for the banal but almost unbearable details. Details such as the way that, although Martha has retreated inside herself in the days after her daughter’s death, walling out the terrible sympathy of family and friends, her body betrays her. Her breasts still leak milk, her gait is still the ungainly waddle of a pregnant woman. A camera that floats like an unmoored soul, clinging to Martha, captures every jagged splinter of Kirby’s phenomenal performance. The film is acutely perceptive on the effect of a bereavement on other people. The loss of a child is an agonising thing; the loss of a newborn, after that raw animal rush of birthing and the surge of love at first sight, is just unimaginable. Most people are daunted – Martha’s workmates are stricken and silent when she returns to her job. But some are drawn towards it, a ghoulish hijacking of grief, brilliantly shown in an encounter with a friend of her mother. The woman pantomimes condolences, pressing a talcum-scented hug on to Martha, whose face is a barely suppressed scream. A high achiever who has always exceeded the expectations of others, Martha now finds herself at odds with loved ones on the “correct” way to process her bereavement. And in this, there are parallels with Eva Trobisch’s All Is Well (also on Netflix), a film about a woman trying to reconcile her trauma with her own strong self-image. Sean just wants the old Martha back, and feels that her chill retreat from him is a punishment. Wounded, he rekindles his addictions. LaBeouf’s is a forceful performance which stamps itself on the film, even in moments of restraint. Given recent headlines, however, his presence is perhaps not the asset it might have been. As Martha’s overbearing mother, Ellen Burstyn delivers a tour de force of coiffed toxicity. As a Jewish woman whose mother gave birth to her under Nazi occupation, she believes that survival is the ultimate act of defiance. And although it is not explicitly stated, she hints that her daughter’s loss is also a failure of sorts. The dinner-party collision between mother’s judgment and daughter’s fury is a showcase for the scorching performances, and for the outstanding screenplay that feeds them.	696
A record number of female directors took charge of major Hollywood films over the last 12 months, according to an annual gender study which found a “stunning imbalance” when it comes to other off-camera roles. The yearly Celluloid Ceiling report by San Diego State University found that women accounted for 16% of directors working on the 100 highest-grossing films in 2020, up from 12% in 2019 and only 4% in 2018. Dr Martha Lauzen, the founder of San Diego State University’s Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film, which conducts the survey, said the increase in female directors helming major projects for two years in a row could show gender balance was finally improving. “Even without the release of some of this year’s most anticipated big-budget films by women – including Chloé Zhao’s Eternals and Cate Shortland’s Black Widow – the percentage of women working as directors inched upward in 2020,” Lauzen said. “The good news is that we’ve now seen two consecutive years of growth for women who direct. This breaks a recent historical pattern in which the numbers trend up one year and down the next. The bad news is that fully 80% of top films still do not have a woman at the helm.” Despite the improvement when it comes to directors, the study found that other off-camera roles were still dominated by men. Lauzen added the “imbalance in behind-the-scenes roles remains stunning”, with almost 70% of films employing fewer than five women in the key positions of director, writer, executive producer, producer, editor or cinematographer. The study, which has been running for more than two decades, also attempted to account for the on-demand, digital audience boosted considerably by the Covid-19 pandemic’s stay-at-home orders. In this analysis, just under 10% of directors were women, down from 16% of the filmmakers on the top box office hits. Despite the trimmed down release schedule because of the Covid-19 pandemic, which forced festivals to go digital and cinemas to shutter, female filmmakers such as Birds of Prey’s Cathy Yan and Wonder Woman 1984’s Patty Jenkins took charge of some of the year’s biggest releases. This year’s Oscars race could see a female winner for best director in a category that has only produced five female nominees in its history. Emerald Fennell (Promising Young Woman), Kelly Reichardt (First Cow), Zhao (Nomadland) and the first-time director Regina King (One Night In Miami) are all fancied as potentials this year and if one of them won they would become only the second woman to win the award after Kathryn Bigelow for the Hurt Locker in 2010. Ahead of last year’s awards season, analysis by the Guardian found that the gender divide was still evident, especially when it came to films up for Oscar contention. The Guardian found that Taron Egerton, Michael B Jordan and Adam Driver – three of the youngest actors who were fancied for the best actor Oscar last year – had never worked on a film directed by a woman. The category’s frontrunner and eventual winner, Joaquin Phoenix, has only once worked with a female director during his 34-film career.	612
There’s a throb of menace driving this gonzo action-thriller from South Korean director Hong Won-chan, who wrote the screenplays for The Yellow Sea and The Chaser. This was a big box-office hit on its home turf. Hwang Jung-min is In-nam, a former cop turned paid assassin who has just whacked a yakuza in Tokyo, and now this dead man’s fanatically violent blood-brother Ray (Lee Jung-jae) is out for revenge. To add to this, In-nam hears that his former girlfriend has been killed in Bangkok, following a bungled attempt to make contact with the kidnappers of her nine-year-old daughter – and the child is still alive, in the abductors’ hands. So In-nam journeys to Thailand on a desperate redemptive mission to save this little girl, with the scary and blood-thirsty Ray on his trail, and the only person in Bangkok who can help him is Yui (Park Jung-min); Yui is a transgender woman who, for all that she is no mobster, manages at one stage to ram a van with her pickup truck, saving In-nam’s life. The twin storylines should undermine the film’s pace and focus. They don’t. There are some impressively spectacular shootouts in the streets and a Bourne-level rooftop chase, together with some very crunchy close-quarters martial arts. Hwang, his face almost always covered in beads of sweat, is a very persuasive and impassive action hero and Lee is creepy and uproariously over the top. Could he be a Bond villain in the years to come? The 007 franchise could certainly do a lot worse. Released on digital formats on 4 January.	305
In the Guide’s weekly Solved! column, we look into a crucial pop-culture question you’ve been burning to know the answer to – and settle it, once and for all Regardless of where you sit on the Star-Wars-Fan-Ometer TM – from bored mum to die-hard duvet-owner – everyone knows: stormtroopers, AKA the Galactic Empire’s plastic-looking soldiers, can’t shoot for toffee. This is made clear as early as Episode IV: A New Hope, when Luke and Han rescue Leia from the evil clutches of (dunn, dunn d-dunn) Darth Vader and blast their way back through the Death Star corridors to the Millennium Falcon. Wave upon wave of stormtroopers lie at every corner yet none can land a single shot and they topple like dominoes. Luke, Han and Leia use pilfered stormtrooper E-11 rifles, so Vader’s minions can’t even blame their tools. So why are they such a horrible aim? Well, for a start, it cannot help that they can’t see properly. Not as in “stormtroopers need to go to Specsavers”, but as Luke says when he and Han don ’trooper outfits to aid their escape: “I can’t see a thing in this helmet.” Is this a design flaw or something more sinister? In A New Hope, Darth Vader states he wants Leia alive. He’s planted a homing beacon on the Millennium Falcon and needs Luke, Han and Leia to escape so they can lead the Empire back to the Rebel base. So that means those stormtroopers must have been briefed to miss. Maybe that’s why they make such a song and dance about getting flung backwards when they get shot? They’re not even hurt, and are taking a dive so they can go for an early lunch. If they are not being ordered to miss, perhaps an unseen presence is messing with their aim. As Obi-Wan says to Han: “In my experience, there is no such thing as luck.” Maybe it’s the Force that turns stormtroopers into such crap potshots? Equally, the explanation could be far more prosaic. After all, how does one become a stormtrooper anyway? In the old days of Episode II: Attack of the Clones, stormtroopers (or more accurately clone troopers, cloned from the mercenary Jango Fett) were in inexhaustible supply. But in Episode VII: The Force Awakens, the First Order is so desperate it is reduced to kidnapping children (such as Finn) to enter stormtrooper training academy without so much as an entrance exam or shooting-proficiency test. Maybe that’s why they tend to shoot from the hip, which as we all know makes it notoriously hard to aim (even if it works for John Wayne, Clint Eastwood, Indiana Jones and, well, Han Solo). Stormtroopers fight in armies, and armies have ranks, so maybe the rubbish ones are getting sent to the frontline. What we don’t see are brigadier general and field marshal stormtrooper sipping Château Lafite over target practice back at HQ. Perhaps most crucially, stormtroopers are only human. So we should look at human psychology: namely social loafing, the phenomenon where a person will exert less effort to achieve a goal when they work in a group. Your average frontline stormtrooper is poorly trained, can’t see, has been told to miss, is firing against the Force, and may not want to be a stormtrooper anyway. Wouldn’t you just blast randomly into the void desperately hoping that someone else was going to do all the killing for you? To conclude: stormtroopers are lazy and that’s why they can’t shoot straight. They just can’t be bothered. • This article was amended on 5 January 2021. In Episode VII: The Force Awakens the stormtroopers are acting for the First Order – a successor to the Empire.	743
After the Rocky-level beating the film industry took in 2020, here’s a potential silver lining for 2021: we might never have it so good. Especially if we mean quality dramas and exciting new stories – the type of things people complain the movies don’t do enough of. Of course, a lot depends on cinemas reopening and anticipated films living up to the hype but, hey, it’s hope! One thing we can be sure of: as a result of the Great 2020 Shutdown, we’re effectively getting two awards seasons in one year. Traditionally, the cut-off date for awards eligibility is the end of the year, after which the feast of quality releases turns to a famine of duds and rejects. This year, however, the whole season has been pushed back two months, culminating in the Academy Awards on 25 April. Eligibility deadlines have been extended to the end of February. As a result, the usual Jan/Feb dumping ground won’t apply. All feast, no famine. Then, just six months later, assuming things return to normal, we’re ramping up for next year’s awards, which means the end of 2021 will also be stacked with decent movies. That’s the theory, at least. We’ve already got a promising batch of buzzed-about titles to look forward to in the coming months: Chloé Zhao’s Frances McDormand-starring docu-fiction Nomadland, Regina King’s directorial debut One Night in Miami, Indian epic The White Tiger, emotional tour de force Pieces of a Woman, Mads Mikkelsen’s drinking drama Another Round, Carey Mulligan thriller Promising Young Woman (which premiered a whole year ago at Sundance). Later in the year, awards season 2022 contenders could include new movies from heavyweights like Damien Chazelle, Joel Coen, Jane Campion, Guillermo del Toro, Ridley Scott and Paul Thomas Anderson, not to mention long-awaited marquee movies such as Dune and West Side Story. If 2020 was good for anything it was sorting the wheat from the chaff – not just at the awards end but across the board. The good stuff we were promised last year we should be getting this year: Wes Anderson’s The French Dispatch, Edgar Wright’s Last Night in Soho, Roger Michell’s The Duke, Joanna Hogg’s The Souvenir: Part II, David Lowery’s The Green Knight and indie hits Minari and Zola. And if Parasite really did break down the one-inch barrier of subtitles, there’s a backlog of festival-tested international cinema awaiting, too. There’s the separate question of whether these end up in cinemas or on streaming, and whether anyone will have the inclination to see them after such a screen-heavy 2020. And let’s not get carried away: this time next year we could well be grouching, like Statler and Waldorf, that they don’t make ’em like they used to. But for now let’s at least be excited about the slightly greater likelihood of seeing a decent movie at the cinema this year. Surely we’ve earned it?	593
Tanya Roberts, the glamorous actor who starred opposite Roger Moore in the 1985 Bond film A View to a Kill, has died aged 65, it has been reported. Roberts’ death had been mistakenly announced by her representative Mike Pingel on Sunday, leading to multiple news organisations, including the Guardian, to report it, before a retraction was issued a day later. Now Roberts’ partner Lance O’Brien is reported to have said he was informed by staff at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles that Roberts died on Monday evening. O’Brien had reportedly mistakenly informed Pingel of her death on Sunday, leading to inaccurate media reports. The Sun quoted O’Brien as saying Roberts died from an unspecified illness that began with a urinary tract infection, and subsequently affected her kidneys, liver and gall bladder. He also said Roberts had collapsed at home in Los Angeles. O’Brien said that he believed Roberts had died on Sunday after visiting her in hospital, and told Pingel, who announced it to the media. However, while being filmed by the TV show Inside Edition, O’Brien received a call on Monday from the hospital saying that Roberts was alive. Cedars-Sinai Hospital has not commented, citing patient confidentiality. Roberts’ best-known film role was in A View to a Kill, where she played geologist Stacey Sutton, Bond’s principal love interest and a key ally in the battle against Christopher Walken’s villainous industrialist Max Zorin. By then she had already consolidated her on-screen appeal by appearing in the 1980-81 season of detective series Charlie’s Angels, taking over from Shelley Hack as one of the three title characters. Born Victoria Leigh Blum, Roberts carved out a career as a model before moving to Hollywood with her screenwriter husband, Barry Roberts. She secured a string of small roles, including James Toback’s 1978 drama Fingers and waxwork slasher Tourist Trap. After winning the Charlie’s Angels role her profile increased, and she was cast as slave girl Kiri in cult fantasy-horror The Beastmaster (1982) and as the title role in the Tarzan-style adventure Sheena: Queen of the Jungle, released in 1984 and which has also become a cult film despite its disastrous initial reception. Roberts disliked the “Bond girl” label, telling the Daily Mail that it pigeonholed her as a “dumb, glamorous broad” and that “the reason most Bond girls don’t go on to have careers [is] because people just don’t take them seriously”. But she said she did not regret taking the role: “At the time I didn’t know what I know now, and to be honest, who would turn that role down, really? Nobody would … I was very young and I did what I felt was the right choice to make.” A View to a Kill did not, as Roberts correctly suggested, lead to a career transformation: she found herself playing in “erotic thrillers” such as Night Eyes, Inner Sanctum, and Sins of Desire, and TV series such as Hot Line (also with an “erotic” slant). However, in 1998 she was cast in a long-running role in retro sitcom That ’70s Show, as dim-bulb Midge Pinciotti, appearing in more than 80 episodes. Her husband’s terminal illness, and subsequent death in 2006, led her to retire from acting.	644
The White Tiger is a story of servitude, resentment and love – and what its hero calls “the contented smile that comes to the lips of a servant who has done his duty by his master”. He does a lot of smiling in this film, but this is about something other than contentment. It is a professional reflex and a personal holding pattern, a blank grin kept in place while the servant decides if he in fact hates his master, and while he also decides if he might somehow one day be the master himself. It is an ambiguous smile, which causes him to wonder if he hates the master behind a facade of loving, or loves this role-model behind a facade of hating. And this desperate aspirational cunning and survival-struggle is happening in India, which is shown to have the same ambiguously submissive attitude to the globalised employer forces of China, Britain and the United States, who all want India’s cheap labour for their outsourcing. The drama is adapted by film-maker Ramin Bahrani from the 2008 bestseller and Booker prize winner by Aravind Adiga, and Bahrani also directs with terrific storytelling energy. It is powered by satirical pessimism about a feudal-gangster system depicted as alive and well in 21st-century India – thriving in parallel with the cynical exploitation and arrogance of other countries. Bahrani finds in this story the same battle with poverty that he gave us in Man Push Cart (2005) and a toxic mentor-mentee bromance to compare with his 99 Homes (2014), in which the hero also finds himself working for the people who humiliated his family. Adarsh Gourav gives a tremendous performance as Balram, a likely lad from a dirt-poor village who once deeply impressed his teachers with his academic flair – as rare as a white tiger. But his family’s catastrophic collapse into poverty meant that his schooling had to be abandoned, and grownup Balram is watchfully aware of the wealthy landlord family presiding over his wretchedness, grasping at their rent even though they are already rich through exporting coal. There is the hatchet-faced patriarch nicknamed the Stork (played by director and actor Mahesh Manjrekar), and the Mongoose (Vijay Maurya), his boorish elder son. But there is also the more liberal, tolerant younger son Ashok (Rajkummar Rao), who is just back from the US with his Indian-American wife Pinky (Priyanka Chopra). Ruthlessly ambitious Balram makes it his business to grovel strategically to this overlord family and soon gets a job as personal driver to Ashok and Pinky, humbly living in the dank subterranean level of their luxury Delhi apartment block and being treated kindly by this modern-minded, Americanised young couple, who pride themselves on being nice to the staff – up to a point. But a terrible accident brings their relationship, and Balram’s secret self-hate, to a crisis. The White Tiger is a dangerous adventure of self-betterment from the teeming city streets, influenced by Adiga’s own avowed love of Dickens and Balzac, and it’s a really enjoyable story, though not without flaws. I could have done without Balram introducing himself through the hackneyed 90s device of the freeze-frame/voiceover, bringing us into his story at its highest moment of car-crash drama and tragedy – everything but a needle-scratch into silence. It makes for a slightly misjudged moment of irony. And it is arguably unconvincing that, having shown us how the ruling classes can get away with murder because the lower-caste victims are all disposably alike, the film suggests that servants could also get away with it because they are all indistinguishable. It can’t be as easy as that. But I liked Balram’s epiphany that the servant’s real relief is not to dream that he has killed his master and then wake to find that he hasn’t, but to dream that he has timidly failed to murder his master and then wake in riches to find, once again, that he has. The idea of family is behind it all. Balram’s own family are of no actual help. Balram will often claim that Ashok and Pinky are his true family and for all that this is a gruesome perversion of the truth, this fatcat clan often does not seem to be much more callous and indifferent than Balram’s own kin. Tellingly, Balram shows no great interest in getting married: whatever romantic energies he has are entirely subsumed into his need to submit, parasitically, to his employer. An absorbing tale of feline ambition. • The White Tiger is on Netflix on 22 January.	853
Shakespeare’s line about “second childishness and mere oblivion” – the last of the seven ages of man bleakly proclaimed by Jacques in As You Like It – might come back to you watching this. This very moving and profound documentary, from director Kristof Bilsen and executive producer Kirsten Johnson (Dick Johnson Is Dead), is about dementia, dementia care, the globalised market in compassion and what society deems to be woman’s work. My colleague Charlie Phillips enthused about this film in 2019 and I can only agree. It is a deeply affecting portrait of what it means to be a professional caregiver; and what it means for both patient and nurse to be separated from their families by fate, biology and market forces. Pomm is a nurse at a specialist-care residential facility for people with dementia in Chang Mai in northern Thailand. The patients are from German-speaking countries and the facility is owned by a Swiss national, Martin Woodtli, who is married to a Thai woman. His economic model is what you might call “Best Exotic Marigold Hotel”: the cost for the European families is about half what it would be in their own countries. Pomm earns a solid wage but she must live at the facility, four hours’ drive away from her children, who are cared for by her elderly mother and also by her partner, from whom she is separated. The movie begins by showing Pomm’s heartwrenching sadness at the loss of an elderly patient called Elisabeth, whose family arrive for her Buddhist funeral (there is evidently no question of taking the body back to the home country); then Pomm prepares for a new arrival to take Elisabeth’s place. This is Maya, from Switzerland, who has developed dementia at the terrifyingly early age of 57 and whose husband and grownup daughters can no longer cope. Maya’s family are shown explaining, matter-of-factly, that this isn’t a matter of callousness, but rather their unselfish renouncing of the instinct to be close to their mum in order to place her where she will receive better care. Is that really what they think? Who will ever know? But their own suppressed sadness, managed with a spirited focus on cheerfulness and positivity, is clear enough. And so begins the long, difficult business of acclimatising the bewildered Maya to her sudden, surreal shift to Thailand, with landscape so different from Switzerland. Like Elisabeth, she is initially told she is on “holiday”, which may help with the transition or simply add to the confusion. Maya can speak to her husband via Skype – apparently in Martin’s office – but clearly she does not understand what is happening. Pomm becomes a mother to Maya but also, poignantly, a kind of daughter+, with the intimacy and gentleness of her care. Meanwhile, she is alienated from her own mother and children, a dynamic happening in a have/have-not parallel with Maya’s extended family. Pomm can see what we can: that she is imprisoned in a second-generation care loop. Her mother must look after her kids while she earns a living – and when her daughters are old enough, they might well take a similar job in Thailand (or maybe domestic service in the Middle East), while Pomm looks after their kids. So it goes on. And who will look after Pomm if she gets dementia? This is a film that puts tough questions before us in a startlingly contemporary context, which has been created by capitalism. For the dementia patients and their families, Thailand might well seem like an antechamber to the next world, or maybe even the afterlife itself. But for the Thai people, it is nothing so exotic, and it is harrowing when Pomm bursts into tears at the end, as if intuiting all the sadness in the air that none of the grownups are allowed to acknowledge. Mother is released on digital formats on 11 January.	745
In a year devastated by the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, Sam Mendes’s first world war drama 1917 has emerged as the biggest earner of 2020 at the UK cinema box office, according to the annual report by box office analyst Comscore. Released in the UK on 10 January, 1917 was inspired by anecdotes told to the director by his grandfather, Alfred Mendes, who served on the western front. It starred George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman as two soldiers charged with carrying a vital message across the battlefield, and won three Oscars (for cinematography, sound mixing and visual effects). Aided by its high profile on the award circuit, 1917 earned £44m in UK cinemas. However, 2020 was a disastrous year for UK cinemas, with mass cinema closures and release cancellations that began with the first national lockdown in March resulting in a drop of 76% from the year before. In total, UK cinemas earned £322.2m in 2020, compared with £1.3bn in 2019. Ironically, the first quarter of 2020 exceeded expectations, up more than 20% on 2019. However, the lockdown saw virtually no cinema activity in April, May and June, before cautious reopenings in early July saw a modest revival, with four consecutive weeks in September and October recording over £70m in total. The second lockdown in November saw box office drop sharply, before reviving again in December as restrictions were relaxed. Nine out of the top 10 films were released before the pandemic took hold, including the film in second place, Sonic the Hedgehog (£19.3m), as well as Bad Boys for Life (£16.2m, 4th place), Dolittle (15.9m, 5th) and Parasite (£12.1m, 8th). Little Women (£15.3m, 6th), Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (£11.3m, 9th) and Jumanji: The Next Level (£11m, 10th) were all released in 2019. The sole title in the list released after March is Tenet, which ended the year in third place with total earnings of £17.4m, arrived in the UK in August as nearly every other Hollywood-produced film had its release date pushed back. While Tenet director Christopher Nolan was lauded for his commitment to attempting to restart audiences’ cinemagoing habits, the film’s enormous production budget meant that its modest results damaged the prospects for a widespread return to cinemas by the Hollywood studios, and contributed to its producers Warner Bros’ decision to release its upcoming blockbusters on its streaming service in the US. Smaller venues, including the majority of independent UK cinemas, fared slightly less badly than cinemas with multiple screens – single-screen venues recording a 68% drop in business, contrasted with 77% for multiplexes with six or more screens. Comscore suggest that “the continued availability of arthouse/independent British titles, event cinema, catalogue and short-windowed titles is a major factor” and that “multiplexes are more reliant on the pipeline of major Hollywood blockbusters” which all but dried up. Comscore said that while the final cinema admission numbers are still being collated the total is expected to be in the region of 42m to 43m in the UK: the lowest total since records began in 1928, and well below the previous low of 54m in 1984. Cineworld, the UK’s biggest chain, has kept doors to its 127 theatres in the UK and Ireland shut since October, writing off the year when the premiere of No Time To Die was pushed back again to April this year. Analysts at Omdia forecast a slow return to pre-Covid box office levels. This year the box office is currently forecast to be 40% down on 2019, at about £750m. “The big movies [this year] start with Bond,” says Tim Richards, chief executive of Vue, the UK’s third-largest cinema chain. “Then there will be three years of [delayed] movies in an 18-month period. There will be pent up demand to go out and go to almost any movie.” Top 10 films at the UK box office in 2020 1. 1917 – £44m 2. Sonic the Hedgehog – £19.3m 3. Tenet – £17.4m 4. Bad Boys for Life – £16.2m 5. Dolittle – £15.9m 6. Little Women – £15.3m (released 2019, £22.1m total) 7. The Gentlemen – £12.2m 8. Parasite – £12.1m 9. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker – £11.3m (released 2019, £58.2m total) 10. Jumanji: The Next Level – £11m (released 2019, £36.8m total)	848
This telephonically themed horror film, set in nameless American suburbia circa 1987, is not to be confused with the Korean horror film of the same name that also came out this year (and relies crucially on a landline call). This confection is a fairly shonky assemblage of tired tropes, full of dropped connections and annoying static. Its biggest virtue is that it contains another gamey, and game-for-anything, performance from horror-film matriarch Lin Shaye. Shaye has played spooky ladies in scads of scary films, such as the Insidious franchise and lesser known fare such as the enticingly titled Helen Keller vs Nightwolves. Here she is Edith Cranston, a former schoolteacher who has been a raving mess since being blamed for the death of one of her pupils (although never convicted of the murder). Nevertheless, a gaggle of teenagers, including Tonya (Erin Sanders), older sister of the murdered child, has persisted in taunting, teasing, playing pranks and bullying Edith for years. When Tonya and new kid in town Chris (Chester Rushing), along with brothers Brett (Sloane Morgan Siegel) and Zack (Mike Manning), finally push Cranston too far, she kills herself. But her husband Edward (Tobin Bell) summons the high-school seniors back to the house with a strange proposition: if they make a phone call on a decrepit old princess phone, ostensibly to a handset installed in Edith’s grave, and stay on the line for just one minute, they’ll each earn a substantial inheritance. Being teens in an American horror film, the kids are too stupid and greedy to twig this is a terrible idea. Traumatic flashbacks, mangled corpses with gymnastic abilities and blood-splattered undead apparitions soon ensue. One might posit a subtextual interpretation that the youth of today, reared on mobiles, are so unaccustomed to landlines that they see these once ubiquitous household fixtures simply as conveyances for transmitting evil. Released on 11 January on digital formats.	369
This is an extraordinary and otherworldly feature film from the tiny landlocked kingdom of Lesotho in southern Africa. It is the tale of a rebel spirit: an elderly woman who opposes government plans to flood her village, making way for a dam. It’s a film about resistance and resilience, but director Lemohang Jeremiah Mosese is coolly unsentimental and realistic about the inevitable march of capitalism and construction. Weaving in ideas around displacement, collective identity and history, this film takes on almost mythic qualities. Some of the actors are non-professionals, but the central role is performed by Mary Twala, who appeared in Idris Elba’s Nelson Mandela biopic Long Walk to Freedom. She plays Mantoa, an 80-year-old widow whose son – her last remaining relative – is killed in a mining accident in neighbouring South Africa. (The film isn’t about poverty, but it’s present in every frame.) Feeling ready to die, Mantoa is making arrangements to be buried in the village graveyard when she hears of the dam project; villagers are to be forcibly resettled in the city. Mantoa decides to put stop to it. She has nothing left to live for, and in a sense this gives her real power. She doesn’t care about offending the pastor, or if people think she’s a witch; she is bent on being buried with her family. This is a severe, uncompromising film; it’s more like a series of images strung together, each framed exactingly, like a painting. At the centre of it all is Twala, often silent, her expression fixed in determination – no words needed. Mosese has said that to avoid cliche he wrote the character as a man then switched the name to female. And Twala gives a tremendous performance, intimate yet epic. This Is Not a Burial is the first film from Lesotho to be entered into the Oscars race for best international feature. Sadly, Twala did not live to share in the success; she died in July last year. • This Is Not a Burial, It’s a Resurrection is on Mubi from 13 January.	404
First-time feature director Tyler Taormina has dreamed his way into a very strange and intriguing film: a Gen-Z reverie about life and fate, somewhere between The Prom and The Purge. The film never behaves as if it is anything other than a realist coming-of-age drama but there is something else going on. Haley (Haley Bodell) is part of a clique of popular high-school kids in a bland suburban town who are preparing to take part in a local tradition. She and some other girls are wearing floaty dresses of sacrificial white and getting ready to go down to a local deli called Monty’s – along with a whole crowd of other kids – for what seems to be a pairing-off ritual, like a dance without music or dancing. But there is a lot riding on this, and Haley can’t persuade herself that she wants to join in. Ham on Rye is a satirical parable on conformism and aspiration, and it speaks to anyone who, in settled adulthood, looks back to when their life and romantic chances were arbitrarily decided by a few events in their teens and early 20s. And there’s another layer, too. Ham on Rye takes a bleakly subversive look at the whole idea of breaking free of your boring suburban home town and making it in the glamorous adult world beyond. This is the theme of so many films, and perhaps it is the overriding theme of Hollywood itself. So many films succumb to the romantic fantasy that the way to do this is to be a rebel, a free-thinker, a defier-of-norms. Yet this film, in its surreal way, is grimly about something closer to the un-surreal truth: the people who got out of their boring, philistine home towns were overwhelmingly the competent conformists, at least outwardly and temporarily. They were the ones who worked hard, got good grades and went far away to college, where their individuality could at last flourish. Taormina’s meditation on all this could be compared to Yorgos Lanthimos or Gus Van Sant, but it is very individual work, as creepy as a ghost story. • Ham on Rye is available on Mubi from 11 January.	407
Veteran Hong Kong action director Stanley Tong reunites with his longtime star Jackie Chan for this amiable but rather under-par adventure with silly CGI effects. Chan is allowed one or two comedy moments, but takes a very straight and stately role as Tang, the “elder statesman”-type director of an elite private security firm called Vanguard, presiding over tough, battle-ready and apparently also catwalk-ready young people – and occasionally pulling a few martial arts moves. In his trim three-piece suit and glasses, however, he looks faintly like Ronnie Corbett. A Chinese accountant and his young wife are kidnapped in London’s Chinatown and Vanguard (with its preposterous HQ full of people wearing phone headsets and gazing at computer screens) is tasked with rescuing him, his wife and his winsome daughter, who is doing laudable conservation work in a nation state referred to initially as “Africa”. She is also vulnerable to abduction as she frolics with CGI big cats in Lion King world. Tang and his crew toughly resolve to rescue their man, while frowning at his supposedly unwitting links with arms dealers, the source of all his woes. Their adventure takes them all over the world, from London (where Chinatown and Buckingham Palace are apparently adjacent) to a fictional land that looks vaguely like Zambia and then to the ineffably boring but wealthy world of Dubai. The scene with a jetski on the edge of a waterfall deserves points, but this feels disposable: the Chinese New Year is earnestly referenced as part of the film’s strident and faintly humourless patriotism. • Vanguard is in cinemas and on digital formats from 8 January.	305
For a studio that prides itself on letting directors get on with the job, Warner Bros sure is prone to the odd jot of heavy executive interference. Or so it might initially appear from recent comments made by Wonder Woman 1984’s Patty Jenkins on Marc Maron’s WTF podcast, which have subsequently been picked up by media outlets across the globe. Discussing Gal Gadot’s first turn as the Amazonian superhero in 2017’s widely-acclaimed Wonder Woman, Jenkins revealed she initially battled the studio to get her vision of a warm-hearted, loving Diana of Themyscira across, ultimately winning out over an approach that would have seen the character engaging in extreme ultraviolence. “I felt like they wanted to hire me like a beard; they wanted me to walk around on set being a female director – but it was their story and their vision,” said Jenkins of her first experiences with the studio. “Even when I first joined Wonder Woman it was like, ‘Uhh, yeah, OK, but let’s do it this other way.’ But I was like, ‘Women don’t want to see that. Her being harsh and tough and cutting people’s heads off … I’m a Wonder Woman fan, that’s not what we’re looking for.’ Still, I could feel that shaky nervousness of my point of view.” Jenkins has since taken to Twitter to point out that she was rarely “at war” with Warner Bros and was discussing conversations that took place over a decade ago, (presumably) with very different executives to those who eventually greenlit Wonder Woman. The Monster film-maker first began talks on taking on a Wonder Woman moviein 2007, but it wasn’t until the best part of a decade later that she was invited to finally make the film with full creative freedom. That makes sense when you watch the 2017 movie, which feels like an entirely different beast to other episodes in the early DC “extended universe” such as the dark and knuckle-headed Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice. Even the later Justice League, a lighter-toned affair clearly influenced by the success of Wonder Woman, didn’t depict Gadot’s battling Amazon the way Jenkins would have. The film-maker told Yahoo recently that she was “uncomfortable with who she was and how she was seen”, after director Joss Whedon oversaw scenes in which the superhero is over-sexualised compared with her appearances in other movies. All of which brings us to Wonder Woman 1984, a so-so affair that, while entertaining enough for hardcore fans, seems to have fallen into the typical superhero sequel trap that previously affected Marvel’s Iron Man 2 and Thor: The Dark World. Here is a movie where Jenkins clearly had full creative control following its predecessor’s impressive box office take and almost universal critical acclaim. So why has it left such a sense of “meh?” The set-piece sequences are spectacular – in particular, Jenkins’ bravura opening vision of a cross-Themyscira athletics marathon that makes the modern Olympics look like a toddler’s egg and spoon race. The Mandalorian’s Pedro Pascal brings an unusual blend of humanity and furniture-chewing bad guy brio to the role of villain Maxwell Lord, Gadot is as splendidly statuesque as ever in the lead role, and her fish-out-of-water badinage with Chris Pine’s miraculously revived Steve Trevor is a thing of joy. The sequel also cleaves closely to Wonder Woman’s essential mantras, her powerful, independent femininity, kindness and grace. It does not pull its punches when depicting masculinity at its most toxic, yet utterly avoids any descent into myopic misandry. These are nuances to treasure. So what’s not to like? Perhaps the only criticism that can be levelled at Jenkins is that there is little new other than the 80s-setting and a freaky new MacGuffin to the essential makeup of Wonder Woman 1984. One can’t help feeling that if this had been a Marvel movie, there would have been scope to introduce other superheroes to lighten the load on the other princess Diana. And yet Jenkins has always preferred the standalone approach. Ultimately the film-maker got to make the Wonder Woman movie she wanted to make, without any studio interference – again, a rare achievement in Hollywood. It’s just a pity she didn’t – quite – manage to pull off the same trick twice.	832
Nothing lasts for ever. In time the trees will wither, the seas will boil and the mountains will crumble to dust. And nothing reinforces the ephemeral cruelty of the universe like the news that Rowan Atkinson doesn’t want to be Mr Bean any more. In an interview with the Radio Times this week, Atkinson said of Mr Bean: “I don’t much enjoy playing him. The weight of responsibility is not pleasant. I find it stressful and exhausting, and I look forward to the end of it.” And that’s fair enough; Mr Bean has now been a going concern for 31 years, and has taken the form of a television programme, two films, an animated series, a sketch performed for the Olympics nine years ago and – slightly improbably – four books. Besides, Atkinson is now in his mid-60s, and it’s only natural that his tastes will change over time. In his 30s, he had the physical energy to wobble around with his eyes all big. Now that he has the wisdom of an older man, he’d rather devote that energy to attacking cancel culture so vehemently that you’d be forgiven for thinking that Mr Bean was actually a boundary-pushing political satire about Islamic fundamentalism and not a TV show about a man with goggly eyes making “ooh” noises at inanimate objects. Mr Bean is not alone in his retirement plans. This week, Sacha Baron Cohen revealed that Borat is now similarly extinct, telling Variety: “I brought Borat out [of retirement] because of Trump. There was a purpose to this movie, and I don’t really see the purpose to doing it again.” We’ve lost two indelible comedy characters in a matter of days? Who could possibly be next? Edina Monsoon? Hyacinth Bucket? Not to worry though, because the creators have not completely abandoned their shticks. After all, anyone who saw Cohen’s This Is America series will know that it basically consisted of loads of Boraty Borats Boratting like mad at a succession of Borat-style oblivious stooges. Similarly, this year will see Atkinson’s streaming debut on a Netflix series entitled Man Vs Bee, which sounds very much like he marched into the company’s HQ and said: “What if Mr Bean, but insect?” Still, it’s only fair to let Borat and Mr Bean die. Both characters have been around since the 1990s, and both are so broadly drawn and familiar that they automatically overshadow anything else that Rowan Atkinson and Sacha Baron Cohen have ever done. They’re deeply creative people, and perhaps these definitive murders will set them free to explore other outlets. Plus, never say never. You’ll remember that Steve Coogan once went sour on Alan Partridge, feeling that the creation had become a millstone around his neck. It looked as if we had seen the last of the character for ever but, once Coogan had proved his artistic credibility with Philomena, he became more comfortable with the legacy of Partridge. As such, he is filming the second series of BBC One’s This Time With Alan Partridge. Similarly, when Ricky Gervais ended The Office in 2003, David Brent went down with the ship. But Gervais’s later success gave him the freedom to revisit his best-known character in the 2016 movie David Brent: Life on the Road. Although, actually, that film was horrible, and it made me hate The Office. On second thought, maybe Borat and Mr Bean are better left dead.	678
Michael Apted, who has died aged 79, was a British movie director who – like Ken Loach and Ken Russell – earned his stripes working on TV. But it was his destiny to help create an epic ongoing masterpiece for the small screen with truly cinematic scope and beyond: current-affairs television which had the scale of cinema, combined with the Mass Observation Project and the Roman census. Granada Television’s Seven Up! from 1964, was, to quote a comedy of the era, not so much a programme, more a way of life. It took 14 British children at the Jesuit age of seven (that is, the age at which the Jesuits’ St Ignatius of Loyola famously said he could “show you the man” if schooled early enough) and interviewed them about their lives and opinions – seven from a working-class background and seven from a posher caste. Then it was updated every seven years, finally spanning 56 years. Seven Up! was directed by Paul Almond, with Apted working as a researcher; Apted went to direct all the subsequent series and came to define this utterly gripping and moving thought experiment in class, history and identity; high-mindedly conceived before reality TV, and also, perhaps, before the media and public might not so easily accept such a grand liberal-paternalistic perspective. It had an incalculable effect on British social realist cinema from the early 1960s to the present day – as well as the thinking of the British progressive left – as it asked us to ruminate on the inescapability or otherwise of class, and what narratives were possible for working people. It was also the key influence on one of the greatest American movies of the 21st century: Richard Linklater’s Boyhood (2014), showing the coming-of-age of a young man in a kind of movie time-lapse, filmed over 12 years. And in the noughties it became impossible to watch Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint growing up before our eyes in the Harry Potter movies without thinking of Michael Apted’s magnificently daring creation. Apted was far from being a sobersided social-issue preacher of course: he directed the glorious Jack Rosenthal TV comedy P’Tang Yang Kipperbang in 1982 (that too was a kind of growing-pains drama). On the big screen he was also to direct a Bond movie: The World Is Not Enough in 1999, and his last movie, in 2017, was the entertaining action thriller Unlocked, with Noomi Rapace and John Malkovich. It was Hollywood which gave Apted his biggest career break, and the chance to direct a hugely admired feature film which combined his social concerns with his sure commercial filmic touch. His Oscar-winning Coal Miner’s Daughter (1980), written by Tom Rickman, was a biopic of country singing star Loretta Lynn (played by Sissy Spacek), the miner’s daughter from the mountain country of Kentucky who rose to showbiz greatness. Here too Apted showed a sinewy sense of class and background – though it was America, not Britain, which enabled him to create a movie which showed someone breaking free of it all. Apted also had a sure touch for prestigious, award-winning cinema: Gorillas in the Mist (1988), about naturalist Dian Fossey, and Class Action (1991) about a legal battle against the makers of a defective automobile, both demonstrated his connection with ideas and ideals, and the technique with which he made them work on screen within the conventional studio system. And of course he could handle with terrific élan the straightforward thriller – such as Enigma (2001), his Bletchley Park drama adapted by Tom Stoppard from the Robert Harris novel. Like the children in his unforgettable TV masterpiece, Apted grew up and grew away – but maybe not so very far, and his movies always showed how class, family and country shaped who we are.	727
The British director Michael Apted has died at the age of 79. The film-maker and documentarian was known for films such as Gorillas in the Mist and Coal Miner’s Daughter, as well as his long-running series of Up documentaries. His death has been confirmed by his agency to the Hollywood Reporter. No further details are yet known. Apted’s career started in the 1960s on the small screen, and in 1964, he assisted on the the show Seven Up! as part of the current affairs show World in Action. He helped the director Paul Almond interview 14 seven-year-old children, and continued to independently revisit them every seven years over the course of their lives. The most recent, 63 Up, was released in 2019 and the director referred to it as “the most important thing I have ever done”. The series as a whole won the Peabody award in 2012. “The series was an attempt to do a long view of English society,” Apted said in an interview last year. “The class system needed a kick up the backside.” In promotion for the most recent installment, Apted expressed a desire to continue in another seven years’ time, saying he would continue as long as he “can breathe and speak”. In the 1970s, Apted made his big-screen debut, directing the second world war drama The Triple Echo, starring Oliver Reed and Glenda Jackson. But he saw see his first major film success in 1980 with Coal Miner’s Daughter, a Loretta Lynn biopic starring Sissy Spacek. It was nominated for seven Oscars, winning one for Spacek as best actress. Apted went on to direct Sigourney Weaver in Gorillas in the Mist, a film that also picked up five Oscar nominations; Nell, which scored an Oscar nomination for Jodie Foster; the Kate Winslet drama Enigma; the Jennifer Lopez thriller Enough and, most recently, the action film Unlocked starring Noomi Rapace. “What I like about women at the center of films is that I find that a woman character brings a lot of emotion to a story, whatever a story is,” he said in a 2017 interview. “Whether it’s a woman with gorillas or a country music singer, a woman’s emotional life – at least on the surface – is more dramatic than a man’s.” He also directed the James Bond adventure The World is Not Enough and the fantasy sequel The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. Apted has been remembered by his peers on Twitter, including Paul Feig, director of Bridesmaids. “So very very sad to hear of the passing of Michael Apted,” Feig wrote. “He was always so kind to me and I was such a great admirer of his work.” Gale Anne Hurd, producer of Aliens and The Terminator, tweeted: “Another legendary filmmaker gone … a brilliant documentarian and a wonderful colleague. Do yourself a favor and check out his terrific filmography.” Apted is survived by his wife, Paige Simpson, sons Jim and John, and daughter Lily Mellis.	585
Here’s a film that for decades has been nothing more than a rumour: a jaw-dropping, so-bad-it’s-bad meisterwerk to be savoured by masochists and awfulness connoisseurs. Watching it turned my face into a replica of Munch’s The Scream. This is the thankfully long-lost 1983 film Grizzly II: Revenge (sometimes known as Grizzly II: Predator or Grizzly II: The Concert), the proposed sequel to the mediocre but profitable 1976 Jaws knockoff Grizzly, about a huge bear that goes ape, if you will, after its cubs are killed by poachers and conceives a murderous loathing for all humans straying into its forest. Grizzly II was abandoned after filming finished (with a 16ft mechanical bear and Hungarian woodland standing for a US national park). But its producer Suzanne C Nagy has, after 37 years of legal wrangling, finally got the unedited footage into shape, bulked it up outrageously with new ambient material, repeating the same drone shots of the forest and stock footage of cubs gambolling – and shamelessly released it, capitalising on the extraordinary fact that the first three kids to be killed by the crazy grizzly are played by a big-haired, denim-clad George Clooney (22 years old), Laura Dern (16) and Charlie Sheen (18). This before-they-were-famous triple cameo lasts only a few minutes but the future megastars are cheekily billed above the title. The film also features a while-she-was-famous appearance from Louise Fletcher (Nurse Ratched from One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest), playing the bland official who, in the style of the mayor in Jaws, refuses to let the reported bear eruption cause the cancellation of a lucrative pop concert near the forest, and an extraordinary appearance from John Rhys-Davies in the Robert Shaw-ish role of Bouchard, the “French-Indian” bear hunter who has hated the creatures ever since one killed his wife and daughters. They are all duly credited – but incredibly, there is also a tiny role for our own Timothy Spall, playing the concert’s sound engineer and wearing the same sort of sideways cap he had in Life Is Sweet, and he isn’t credited at all! Could it be that the people behind this release don’t know who he is? Or does Mr Spall, understandably, want his name taken off it? Watching this film is a nightmare in all the wrong ways. Every bear attack consists of a cheesy closeup of the victim’s wide-eyed screaming face, a flash of the mechanical bear– which looks like a moth-eaten old taxidermist’s display item – a roar on the soundtrack, and the actor sheepishly lying face-down on the ground. The film’s outdoor concert scenes mean that for we have to sit through pointless footage of boring local bands. But you have to hand it to the evil geniuses creating Grizzly II: Revenge. These thousands of kids at the concert weren’t “extras”. The movie’s producers had evidently created a real concert for showbiz-starved Soviet-era Hungarian youth, with real customers. It’s quite a business model. Once the lockdown lifts, Nagy should maybe try to get the movie released as a double-bill with Werner Herzog’s Grizzly Man. Tagline: Can you bear it?

In the lead-up to the release of Only God Forgives, director Nicolas Winding Refn gave an interview where he referred to himself as “a pornographer”, compelled to making images that arouse him without necessarily processing what they mean or what effect they might have on an audience. A few months before, Only God Forgives had premiered to the worst reception of any film in competition at Cannes (preceding a string of negative write-ups upon release), the opposite of the rapture that had greeted Refn’s Drive two years earlier, when he earned a standing ovation, a best director prize and the runway for his biggest commercial success by far. What had changed so much from one film to another? The answer is everything and nothing. Like any pornographer, there’s a part of Refn that’s simply perverse: Only God Forgives again places a largely stoic Ryan Gosling in a nocturnal underworld of depravity and ultra-violence, but strips away all of the genre thrills that made Drive such a pleasure – the opening getaway sequence, with its bursts of speed and hide-and-go-seek gamesmanship with the police; a pawnshop robbery gone horribly awry; Albert Brooks’ delicious cast-against-type performance as a vicious gangster. In their place, Refn imposes an atmosphere of somnambulant dread and inevitably, a neon nightmare that unfurls in slow motion. Only God Forgives exists in a kind of cinematic no man’s land, too arch for the genre fans and too grotesque for the arthouse set. And yet it’s fully in keeping with Refn’s evolution as a film-maker, which started with the kicked-up pulp of his Pusher trilogy and has grown in formal rigor ever since, pivoting on a Norse adventure film, 2009’s Valhalla Rising, that starts as a Crusades bloodbath and grows more and more abstract as it goes along. For all of Refn’s evident skill at staging punchy action sequences, he’s become increasingly interested in deconstructing and manipulating our expectations of what genre movies should be. That’s maddening. It’s also, in the right frame of mind, mesmerizing. Opening the film in bright reds and deep blacks, Refn is making noir in color, replacing the single-source black-and-white of American classics with an equally eye-catching study in contrasts. Few neo-noirs have made such a strong visual impression, because they don’t limit their visual palette as much as Refn does here – every frame is carved with precise color and light, like the fussed-over panels of a graphic novel. Combined with the humming synths of Cliff Martinez – who had composed the score for Drive, too, as well as many Steven Soderbergh movies – the film accomplishes more through mood than action, capturing the dilemma of an antihero who exists in a paralyzing state of moral limbo. As Julian, a boxing-club manager and drug dealer, Gosling plays a man who’s part and apart from the Bangkok underworld, someone who offers and indulges in vice, but discovers that he has his limits. His older brother Billy has no such qualms: he’s shown prowling a brothel for a 14-year-old before raping and murdering a prostitute two years older. Their mother Crystal is equally deranged. Played by Kristin Scott Thomas in a performance that upends her image as radically as Brooks in Drive, Crystal arrives in Bangkok seeking revenge when Billy himself is killed by the victim’s father. That puts them into conflict with Chang (Vithaya Pansringarm), a sword-wielding police lieutenant with an extrajudicial approach to the law enforcement. There’s a lot that’s funny, intentionally and unintentionally, about Only God Forgives, starting with the revelation of Julian’s status as the cuckold in his brother’s oedipal relationship with their mother. Played straight, the film would be cardboard juvenilia, a thinly plotted story of retribution marked by exoticism and ultra-violence. But Refn keeps the focus on Gosling as a kind of smarmy Hamlet, forced into this perilous position of having to do his mother’s bidding while understanding the moral wrong of it. His indecisiveness bleeds into a comical fight scene with Chang where he doesn’t land a punch, which may be simple ineptitude, but also reveals a lack of conviction. Much of Refn’s self-seriousness here is a “Kick Me” sign, culminating in a shot where Julian’s longing for his mother’s absent warmth takes a grotesquely literal form. But Only God Forgives has a dreamlike vividness that’s neither easily conjured or easily shaken, in service of a character who’s been rendered a zombie by circumstance, stumbling through events he doesn’t have the standing or courage to stop. He embodies all that’s frustrating about the film – and all that’s audacious about it, too. Only God Forgives is available to watch on Amazon Prime in the US and the BFI Player in the UK	924
“Give me a child until he is seven and I will show you the man.” Aristotle might well be pleased that his maxim was the inspiration behind one of the most celebrated TV documentary series of all time – now the legacy of director Michael Apted, who has died at the age of 79. Tony Walker, who appeared in all nine of the award-winning Up series – which charted the lives of 14 British children from 1963 with Seven Up, through to their 60s, with last year’s 63 Up – led tributes to Apted yesterday. The former taxi driver from east London said Apted, who died on Friday, was “like a family member to me. I loved the man dearly and I’m quite devastated at his passing.” Thomas Schlamme, president of the Directors Guild of America, described apted as a “fearless visionary as a director”. He “saw the trajectory of things when others didn’t, and we were all the beneficiaries of his wisdom and lifelong dedication.” He added: “Our hearts are heavy today as we mourn [his] passing.” The producers of the James Bond film franchise paid tribute to his ability to move “effortlessly and successfully between all genres”. In 1999, Apted directed The World Is Not Enough, starring Pierce Brosnan. “He was beloved by all those who worked with him,” tweeted Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli. Apted was born in 1941 in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, later moving to London with his family. As a teenager he developed a love of cinema, describing watching Ingmar Bergman’s Wild Strawberries as a “road to Damascus moment”. After studying at Cambridge, he joined Granada where he was asked to find children to take part in a one-off documentary. Among the 14 chosen were three boys from a prestigious private school, a boy from a small farm in the Yorkshire Dales, a London boy – Walker – and an east London girl. The show was an early forerunner of reality TV, but focussed on social history and inequality rather than fleeting celebrity and vacuous challenges. It was a success but no further shows were planned. A casual inquiry about the children’s progress led to 14 Up in 1970, this time with Apted as director. He directed all subsequent series. He also worked on Coronation Street in the 1960s, and directed the country music classic Coal Miner’s Daughter, starring Sissy Spacek as singer Loretta Lynn in 1980. The film was nominated for seven Oscars, with Spacek winning best actress. Apted’s movie credits included Gorillas in the Mist, Continental Divide and Critical Condition. His final film was the 2017 thriller Unlocked, starring Orlando Bloom, Michael Douglas and John Malkovich. But the Up series, which won three Baftas, was his most enduring work. It starkly illustrated the differences in life opportunities for children depending on their backgrounds, and charted the personal challenges and traumas faced by participants. Kevin Lygo, managing director of ITV, which broadcast Up, said the series “demonstrated the possibilities of television at its finest in its ambition and its capacity to hold up a mirror to society and engage with and entertain people while enriching our perspective on the human condition. “Michael’s contribution to film and programme-making continues to be felt and he will be sadly missed.” George Jesse Turner, a cameraman who filmed all but the first two series, told the Observer last year: “It was about class in the beginning, but it was not done scientifically, in the way it would be now. It was quite random, simply going to schools in London and Liverpool and the Lake District.” Apted, he said, was “good to work with. When we go out to film, he is never one to say he would like a particular shot. He leaves it to me.” Walker, now 65, whose childhood ambition was to become a jockey, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Saturday that, when he was chosen for the series, “I was a sort of street-urchin kid. I was just excited that the cameras were on me at the time, and I never knew what the implications were. “Most of all, Michael gave you that warm feeling. it was like a Catholicism, every time I heard his voice. it was like going to a psychiatrist… [I had] complete trust in him. I’m really sad, I’ve known Michael for all my life really, but for seven years.”	866
There’s an argument to be made that a film featuring a jet-ski machete fight on the edge of a waterfall, robotic surveillance wasps, solid gold supercars, weaponised attack hyenas and Jackie Chan doesn’t actually need to be good, in the conventional sense of the word. And with its multiple locations (London, Beijing, Dubai, Zambia, India) and efficiently packaged moments of nationalistic fervour, this action picture, which pits Chinese covert security organisation Vanguard against the scenery-mangling forces of evil, is clearly aiming for the pulpy escapist end of the market. But even so, there’s precious little fun to be had in this self-important mess of a movie. Chan plays the head of Vanguard, but spends an awful lot of time in the field with his elite agents. Their mission: to rescue a businessman and his eco-YouTuber daughter Fareeda (Ruohan Xu) from villains who see them as the route to a missing fortune and, ultimately, some kind of genocidal ultra-weapon. The score feels like being trepanned by music; the story, like the VFX action sequences, is illogical and hacked together. It’s an unforgivable waste of Jackie Chan, action-movie legend, reduced here to pratfalls and gurning double takes. Vanguard is available on multiple VOD platforms	242
The genius of Robin Williams is taken as a given by this intensely sad documentary, which pays fleeting tribute to the actor and comedian’s talent but focuses mainly on the undiagnosed neurodegenerative disease that led him to take his own life in 2014. Lewy body dementia is a deadly and devastating condition, one that is little known and frequently misdiagnosed. And for someone like Williams, whose brilliance depended on the quickfire, sparking neural connections of his exceptional brain, the symptoms, which include fear, delusions and hallucinations, must have been particularly terrifying. This film, made at the behest of Williams’s widow, Susan Schneider, is intended to raise awareness of the condition. It’s certainly informative and affecting, but the limited use of early archive footage and the emphasis on Williams’s decline and suffering make for bleak viewing. • On multiple VOD platforms	165
Local governance, according to Musa Hadid, mayor of the Palestinian city of Ramallah, is the most beautiful branch of politics. It’s certainly, as this compelling fly-on-the-wall documentary attests, the area in which he is able to have the most direct connection with the city and its people. The very likable Mayor Hadid is a robustly hands-on public servant – we watch him pondering city branding and overseeing the abseiling Santas at the Christmas tree lighting. We also see him dealing with a sewage spill, berating a bus driver for speeding and, in some of the film’s most dramatic moments, witnessing Israeli forces shooting at protesters, and finding himself temporarily besieged in the city hall. Deft editing and unexpectedly affecting music choices make for an engaging portrait of the kind of impassioned and dedicated politician who seems in short supply right now. • Mayor is available on Curzon Home Cinema, Dogwoof and iTunes	171
“Which of us doesn’t belong?” asks soul singer Sam Cooke (Hamilton’s Leslie Odom Jr), casting his gaze over the men in front of him. It’s 25 February 1964, and gathered with Cooke in a modest Miami Beach hotel room are political activist Malcolm X (Kingsley Ben-Adir), NFL star Jim Brown (Aldis Hodge) and Cassius Clay (Eli Goree), who has just been crowned heavyweight boxing champion of the world. All four are, in Clay’s words, “young, black, righteous, unapologetic, famous”. Cooke’s provocation is the trick question at the heart of Regina King’s slick and energised directorial debut. Written by Kemp Powers (co-writer and co-director of Pixar’s recent hit Soul) and based on his 2013 play of the same name, the film imagines what happened when the four men were brought together in real life to celebrate Clay’s win. Expecting a party with booze and girls, they are instead treated to vanilla ice-cream and a heated debate. “I thought we would reflect,” says Malcolm, spiritual mentor to Clay, who is on the brink of becoming Muhammad Ali and converting to the Nation of Islam. King made her name as an actor, winning an Academy Award in 2019 for If Beale Street Could Talk. As a film-maker she has sharp instincts, breaking out of the play’s one-act structure with a prologue that connects the characters. Cooke is introduced with a performance at the Copacabana Club, crooning a cover of Tammy to an unenthusiastic all-white crowd (“I liked it so much better when Debbie Reynolds sang it,” mutters one onlooker). Brown drives a flashy car to a former plantation house in Georgia, where a white family friend (Beau Bridges) flatters him and calls him the N-word in the same breath. Their meeting is warm, friendly and confined to the front porch. In drawing out the personal and professional humiliations endured by Cooke and Brown, King and Powers needle at the idea that individual wealth, success and celebrity might not be enough to transcend the structural problem of racism. By early 1964, the civil rights movement was gaining popularity and momentum. Still, the struggle was hardly over. The Civil Rights Act didn’t pass into law until July of that year. There are resonances between that historical moment’s buzzing, transformative energy and today’s global fight for black liberation. King seems to have been drawn to this in recent acting roles – Barry Jenkins’s adaptation of James Baldwin’s If Beale Street Could Talk, and the TV version of Watchmen, about the mythology of a white supremacist group, for which she won an Emmy last year. Kemp’s screenplay, then, which explores the nuances of anti-racist protest, is a smart choice for King’s first film as director. What’s more, the conversations between Brown, Cooke, Clay and Malcolm X are still being had today. “If I win ’em over playing our music, I’m knocking down doors for everybody,” says Cooke, defending his right to determine his own creative and business prospects. Malcolm X is suspicious of white “gestures of patronage”. Brown points out the privilege of Malcolm’s fair skin, noting that “we are all far from the same”. King and Powers make a virtue of that difference, emphasising that black identity is not a monolith – a response to Cooke’s line that one of them doesn’t belong. The ensemble cast electrifies Powers’s dialogue, jockeying between black power and integration, activism and commerce, spiritual clarity, pork chops and sex. Malcolm X is played by Ben-Adir with a fragility that subtly foreshadows the civil rights leader’s assassination the following year. His seriousness is rattled and his cool intellect brought to boiling point by the energetic and equally forceful Cooke; Odom is a lightning rod of charisma in the role. In their conviction – or perhaps arrogance – Cooke and Malcolm X are portrayed as two sides of the same coin. • On Amazon Prime from 15 January • This article was amended on 12 January 2021 to clarify that, while the conversation in One Night in Miami is imagined, the meeting between the four men did take place in real life.	831
Here is a throwaway space spoof, an affectionate send-up of the naffness of early 90s video games, that lovingly recreates the vintage details with its production design and fight choreography, but is troublingly low on scripted gags. It plays out in two dimensions: virtual and real life. Inside a computer game, explorer Max Cloud is an intergalactic hero, a preposterous macho knucklehead in latex, sturdily performed by actor and martial arts expert Scott Adkins, who has appeared in a few of the Marvels. I did wonder if an actor with the comic chops for some megaton silliness might have done some heavier lifting here. Meanwhile, in actual Brooklyn, teenage gamer Sarah (Isabelle Allen) is hooked on the Max Cloud video game. After a fight with her dad she is mysteriously teleported into the game – and into the body of a minor character, chef Jake (Elliot James Langridge). You might consider this a waste of a female lead – putting her into the body of a male actor – but there she stays for most of the movie. For any chance of making it back to her real life she must complete the game with the help of her friend playing in her bedroom (Franz Drameh). John Hannah is painfully unfunny as ultra baddie Revengor, who wants to destroy planet Earth over a past snub. This is a film so inoffensive that for the first 10 minutes I thought it was targeted at kids, until one of the characters dropped a swear (and thinking about it, anyone under 40 will be oblivious to its reference). But in lampooning naffness without enough laughs, it veers perilously close to actually being naff. A reminder that clever comedians are required to pull off daft comedy. • Released on 18 January on digital formats.	336
Franka Potente, played Lola I was in New York shooting a couple of films when I got this script called Lola Rennt (Lola Runs). I read it and thought: “This is cool – but kind of weird, too.” I flew back to Berlin, met the writer-director Tom Tykwer, and realised the energy I had felt on the page came from him. The film required me to sprint across Berlin in a pair of Dr Martens. I have to get 100,000 Deutschmarks to my boyfriend Manni in 20 minutes, or he will be killed. We were shooting in August and the crew told me: “When we don’t see your feet, you can wear sneakers.” However, their footfall sounded different, so I just ran in boots all the time. I didn’t train – I probably smoked two packs a day back then – but I was young. And we wanted Lola to look like a real person, not an athlete. I’m not a runner. Never was. Never will be. The only part of the shoot that worried me was where I’m running towards a moving truck with my eyes closed. A rope was lashed around me, supposedly for safety. By the time Tom and I made our next film, The Princess and the Warrior, we were in a relationship. Maybe that’s why he felt comfortable going further – risking me being run over by a truck, and throwing myself off a roof. I had no idea the film would become so iconic. I only found out recently it’s even referenced by Bon Jovi in their It’s My Life video. We knew we’d made a movie that was cool, but we just thought it would be something for a cutting-edge satellite channel. We didn’t think it would have universal appeal. I’ve drowned in The Bourne Supremacy and I’ve been lobotomised in American Horror Story, but watching myself being shot in Run Lola Run beats those. It’s one of the great perks of being an actor, though my dad didn’t enjoy the scene at all. I was recently bullied into showing the film to my daughters, who are seven and nine. They loved it, but were disappointed there wasn’t more blood when the explosive taped to mum’s chest goes off. The moment I realised the film was a hit was at the Munich Filmfest. They showed it as the surprise midnight feature. The audience were super jacked-up from the previous film, Trainspotting, and when Lola ended, 800 people roared like they were at a soccer game. I went from goosebumps to crying. I’ll never forget that feeling. Tom once said any sequel would follow the bum who Manni hands his pistol to at the end of the film. I’d definitely be up for a cameo, but I wouldn’t be running. It’s a different world today. I’d take an Uber. Moritz Bleibtreu, played Manni I got the script just as the German film industry was trying to break away from its very serious, neo-realistic image, and the two Germanys were coming together after reunification. Tom Tykwer was part of the X-Filme collective and seemed to know everything about making movies. He broke down a lot of barriers. I come from a long line of theatre actors, but my family loved all of Lola’s nods to Hitchcock’s Vertigo: the spirals, the animation sequences, the portrait of Kim Novak in the casino scene. In fact, Lola marked the start of my mum’s second career as a movie actor: she plays the blind lady who lends me her phone card. Tom threw everything into the pot: shooting on video, in black-and-white and anime. I’ve seen a lot of films that reference ours. The shoot was really cool. Tom is a big football fan and, as well as beginning the movie with a quote from coach Sepp Herberger referencing West Germany’s 1954 World Cup win, we got to play between takes on the street corner where I rob the supermarket. My character Manni quickly finds out he isn’t made for life as a mafia bagman, though. For me, that’s the genius of Lola: it’s a feminist story. Nineties action movies were about the cool guy with a deep voice who saves the girl. This was one of the first features where you had a woman – a regular woman, not a 6ft Amazonian with diamond triceps – who’s just running to help her boyfriend. And she’s got red hair!	892
Name: Samantha. Age: 64. Not your 64. Hollywood 64. Call it 48. Appearance: No. What do you mean “no”? She’s not appearing. In what? Also, who’s Samantha? O tempora! O mores! How quickly we forget and the cultural discourse moves on. That doesn’t help me. There was a time when it would no more need explaining who “Samantha” was than that the sky is blue or grass is green, such was the fame of Sex and the City and its quartet of fast-living, quick-loving and heavily brunching heroines. Oh, them! Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte and Samantha! There you go. So, what has happened to her? Please can it be the wiping of her line “Lawrence of my labia” in the second SATC movie from the global digital record? Alas, it is not. Rather, it has been announced that SATC is to return in a series called And Just Like That… It will be 10 half-hour episodes following the gals as they adventure through life, love and more brunches in their 50s – but without Samantha. They think there’s a show without Samantha? There’s not even a decent brunch without Samantha. Where’s all the angst-free sex and non-neurotic light relief going to come from? Whose stupid idea was this? Take it up with Kim Cattrall. The actor declined to return to her role. Don’t tell me – she left a Post-it note on Carrie’s laptop screen saying: “I’m sorry – I can’t. Don’t hate me.” That would – pause to spit on the memory of Berger – have been excellent, but no. She simply refused (apparently repeated) attempts to bring her back to the fold. I assume the long-rumoured animosity between Cattrall and her co-star Sarah Jessica Parker is behind this decision. Or is it just the fear of being made to say something like “Lawrence of my labia” again? Most people are assuming the former, although I’m sure they would have just as much sympathy for the latter. We might, incidentally, do away with the “long-rumoured”, thanks to Cattrall’s 2018 Instagram post, aimed at Parker, about “how cruel you really were then and now”. Yowch. Quite. I suppose she doesn’t need the money, either. Or the work. Cattrall has been probably the busiest of the SATC stars since the show ended, carving out a second-act career primarily in the UK on television and on stage, appearing in some prestigious stuff. I still cannot help but wonder if it’s a doomed venture without her. It’s 2021. It matters not a jot either way. Do say: “I look forward to as complex, fresh, funny and fearless an examination of the sixth decade of womanhood as the original SatC provided for the fourth.” Don’t say: “Sponsored by Vagisil.”	581
There are some moments of genuine feeling in this uneven Dublin-set indie about a classical pianist who joins the punk scene after being diagnosed with early-onset Parkinson’s. I wasn’t entirely sold on all the performances and there is a fair amount of predictability in the storytelling. But it’s a film made with warmth and sincerity, and the energy of the soundtrack by local bands helps along the awkward bits. Cilléin McEvoy is pianist Adrian, a former child prodigy on the brink of classical stardom. He reacts with fury and denial to his Parkinson’s diagnosis, disappearing off to Dublin where he rents the fourth room in a shared house. His flatmates are three carefree students in a punk band – two men and female drummer – who don’t spot his telltale tremors. Adrian has known nothing but music and discipline since childhood, and, dressed in his expensive suit and shiny leather loafers, he is the antithesis of punk. But inevitably his sniffiness about the band’s primitive songs gives way to appreciation. There is something in McEvoy’s buttoned-down, accountant-stiff performance that is somehow unconvincing – or perhaps the character is too thinly written. Certainly, he’s eclipsed by Martina Babisova, who gives a lovely natural performance as cool drummer Jodie. When he behaves like a total prat after they sleep together, she calls him out in a way that is disarmingly open and honest; their relationship gives the film its beating heart. Director Chiara Viale is Italian and her camera chases about the Dublin streets looking for fun and good times – it made me desperate to get on a plane and go somewhere, to see something new. The film is a little patchy, but its feelgood mood is hard to resist. • The New Music is available from 18 January on digital platforms.	344
How amazing. Until a few years ago – 2016, in fact – if you asked people for the most absurd example of the politico-showbusiness complex in the 21st-century United States, they would have said Arnold Schwarzenegger’s recall election as governor of California in 2003, his candidacy being announced on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. He was re-elected in 2006, and just about maintained a cheerfully Reaganesque public image of a moderate Republican – uneventfully standing down in 2011 to resume his movie career. We all took the mickey out of the governator. But, right now, he is America’s moral governator with real moral authority. It was the governator who uploaded a video telling Americans to stay home during the Covid crisis. And now it is the governator who has issued a clarion call for decency on YouTube with his admittedly cheesy but genuinely stirring, heartfelt and relevant rebuke to the Trumpians and their desecration of the Capitol – a desecration that even now many Republicans and many sophisticates on the right cannot bring themselves to condemn fully. In his mature Reaganesque style, Schwarzenegger addressed the nation from a presidential-style desk, with the stars and stripes and Californian flag in the background, and a photo of himself in his bodybuilding pomp. With Hollywood-style music on the audio track, he denounced the complicit enablers of Trump’s fascism – culminating in a hilarious flourish of Conan the Barbarian’s sword. That should have been ridiculous. It should have been silly. But, compared with the seedy rightwingers and Fox News alternative-fact merchants and the giggling cynics who said Trump didn’t matter, Schwarzenegger’s sword was rather glorious. I found myself thinking of Evelyn Waugh’s Sword of Honour trilogy – and, yes, however preposterous, there was something honourable about Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Conan sword. Schwarzenegger called the vandalising of the Capitol (and the killing of Capitol police officer Brian Sicknick) America’s “Kristallnacht”. Like many others, I have seen it as America’s beer hall putsch (and who knows if that may not turn out to be the closer analogy?). But, for the time being, Schwarzenegger is absolutely right. And from personal experience, Schwarzenegger was able to address the openly Nazi stylings of the Capitol attackers, with the “Camp Auschwitz” T-shirts, because he grew up in an Austria that, in contrast to Germany, went into fierce denial about its role in the second world war. Schwarzenegger spoke about his angry, depressed and abusive father who beat his children. (Schwarzenegger did not speak in detail, but throughout his governorship much press research went into Gustav Schwarzenegger, the Austrian police chief and Stalingrad military veteran who applied for Nazi party membership in 1938 before the Anschluss, but was not found to have been responsible for war crimes or abuse.) Schwarzenegger’s video today, however schmaltzy and hokey in style, was a real reminder to the fatuous callow right that Nazis and nazism are not just death-metal icons or gamer fantasies. They really did exist, with America-first cheerleaders such as Joseph Kennedy and Charles Lindbergh encouraging their fellow citizens to look the other way. And he also showed us that the immigrant experience can bring wisdom. Arnold’s video is exactly what we all needed.	621
Credit to new film Stardust for even attempting to recount how David Bowie became Ziggy Stardust without using any of his music, including, er, Ziggy Stardust. Denied access to the Bowie back catalogue, most film-makers would have given up. Danny Boyle did, ditching his “wonderful” biopic in 2012 after Bowie turned him down. Stardust finds some creative workarounds. Such as framing the story round a trip to the US where the struggling singer (a miscast Johnny Flynn) is forbidden from performing (he doesn’t have the right paperwork). On the rare occasions this Bowie does sing, it is strictly cover versions (Jacques Brel, Scott Walker, the Yardbirds). He goes to a Velvet Underground gig and listens to the Stooges on the radio, but we don’t hear their music, either. As a result, Stardust resembles a bizarre knock-off – like that notorious Turkish version of Star Wars from the early 80s. Stardust is an extreme example, but much of the art we see in movies is equally fake. While the “official” biopic bandwagon trundles along with hits such as Bohemian Rhapsody and Rocket Man, many unofficial stories go down the Stardust route. Like the Beatles movie Backbeat or the Hendrix biopic Jimi: All Is By My Side, neither of which featured the artists’ own music. Or, more to the point, Todd Haynes’s glam rock odyssey Velvet Goldmine, which was intended to feature several Bowie tunes until, again, Bowie withdrew permission. Haynes retooled the story to make the character less Bowie-like. It is not just a music thing: art and other intellectual property is invariably owned by estates, whose permission must be obtained or palms greased. Even the artist who did Mike Tyson’s face tattoo successfully sued the makers of The Hangover: Part II for using it. Anthony Hopkins’s Surviving Picasso contained no actual Picassos. Likewise, Basquiat featured no works by Jean-Michel Basquiat; instead, director Julian Schnabel oversaw the production of some knock-offs (the movie also features a knock-off Andy Warhol, played by a certain David Bowie). This is also why you didn’t hear Dr Martin Luther King say “I have a dream” in the movie Selma. The King estate had already licensed the rights to Steven Spielberg, who was planning his own MLK movie. Instead, Selma crafted its own oratory “in the style of” King, which was delivered so persuasively by David Oyelowo we barely registered the subterfuge. Does it matter? There was a storm in a teacup last year when culture secretary Oliver Dowden discovered that The Crown was – gasp! – not wholly historically accurate. The Crown is no more “official” than Stardust. It is fakery, and most of us are fine with that. Distinguishing between genuine fakery and fake fakery is splitting hairs. The only thing that matters is how well it’s done.	555
On 23 August 2007, Lindsay Lohan issued a statement to TMZ in the Hollywood dialect of professional contrition that hints at behind-the-scenes PR damage control. In its 11 brief sentences, she makes a plainspoken admission that she’s “addicted to alcohol and drugs”, that her destructive behavior is no one’s responsibility but her own, and that she’s ready to take the steps required to get her back on the path to wellness. While not quite a turning point for her career, which has remained stagnant over the past decade-plus of self-referential screen roles and regrettable pop singles and swiftly shuttered Grecian nightclubs, that press release did provide a fitting coda to the odd and sordid tale of I Know Who Killed Me. Released one month earlier, the mid-budget slasher vehicle for Lohan was derailed again and again by her personal life, even as its text was inextricably bound up in the same. Though DOA at the box office upon its critically savaged theatrical run, this widely, wrongly maligned film has been embraced by a growing mini-cult attuned to its aesthetic of surreal artifice and grim interplay with real life. We appreciate the irony of a woozy-headed meditation on the luster and tragedy inherent to the classic celebrity-in-peril archetype – which its star could not appear on Leno to promote due to a DWI arrest earlier that week. The troubled production process involved working around its leading lady’s mandate to spend 30 nights at the Wonderland rehabilitation facility, bouts of the often-euphemistic Tinseltown ailment “dehydration”, a not-at-all-euphemistic appendectomy, an infected surgical incision, and a paparazzi presence so relentless that a few shutterbugs ended up in the background of some shots in the finished film. But the baggage she dropped off at set only served to deepen and enrich the subtext of a stealth noir gem, one that gestures to a long-bygone era of movie stardom through the framework of a cheaper and dirtier sort of serial killer thriller. As a girl nextdoor seemingly transformed overnight into a vamp with a cigarette-rasped voice and formidable pole-dancing prowess, she brings the thought experiment of “what if Barbara Stanwyck had been fed through Disney’s wringer as a child?” to life in exhilarating fashion. Lohan is first introduced as Aubrey Fleming, the wholesome kind of all-American high schooler who still takes piano lessons and stops her boyfriend at second base. Aubrey promptly falls victim to a psycho with a predilection for using dry ice to peel off layers of skin like lasagna sheets, except that Lohan returns soon after on the side of the same road Cloris Leachman ran on to in Kiss Me Deadly. When she wakes up in the hospital short an arm and a leg, she insists that she’s femme fatale Dakota Moss, the hard-living daughter of a crack addict. The link connecting these two women goes beyond being the figurative yin to the other’s yang, and beyond the kooky Corsican-sister explanation for why Aubrey and Dakota have matching wounds. They constitute a hysterical parody of the cautionary tale projected on to all young women, teenaged starlets in particular, that their virginal innocence can be tarnished into slatternly moral dissipation with one wrong move. Director Chris Sivertson works in a lurid playfulness, offsetting the gratuitous gloved-hand gore some have likened to giallo with a tone of wry melodrama more redolent of the soap opera from Twin Peaks, another of his professed influences. He lets the Aubrey/Dakota duality bleed into the fabric of the film by using the combatting colors blue and red the way others might use black and white, rendering shadows as luminescent splotches and fading out between scenes not to literal darkness or light, but to hues suggesting an elemental good and bad. Lohan’s enacting a fame-ritual dating back to the entertainment industry of the 20s and 30s, gamely being the madonna and whore the tabloid-readers of the world demand she be, if only to show how absurd and outmoded the dichotomy is. Much of Lohan’s post-dry-out work has attempted to play on her public persona, to less than encouraging levels of success. (The less said of her addled, scantily clad, gun-toting nun from Machete, the better.) But for a minute there, it looked like she might have a future as a more skillfully scare-quoted version of herself, still possessed of the canniness and precocity she showed as a rising talent in The Parent Trap and Mean Girls. A close-minded America dismissed I Know Who Killed Me as working nadir of a woman hitting her own rock bottom. Little did they realize they were getting a glimpse of the Lindsay that could’ve been. I Know Who Killed Me is available to rent digitally in the US and on Amazon Prime in the UK	878
Female film-makers have proven triumphant in the nominations for the annual London critics’ circle awards, with movies by Rose Glass, Sarah Gavron, Chloé Zhao and Emerald Fennell scoring the most nods. Glass’s psychological horror Saint Maud leads the pack, with eight nominations, followed by Gavron’s London coming-of-age tale, Rocks, with six, Nomadland, Chloé Zhao’s Oscar-tipped road movie, with five, and Fennell’s rape revenge comedy Promising Young Woman, with four. David Fincher’s Hollywood love letter, Mank, also took four, as did Steve McQueen’s Lovers Rock, part of his quintet of Small Axe films of the BBC. The 41st edition of the awards mixes fiction and non-fiction for its 10-strong shortlist for film of the year, which also includes Roy Andersson’s existential comedy About Endlessness, Collective, a documentary uncovering extraordinary corruption in Romania, Charlie Kaufman’s mind-bending I’m Thinking of Ending Things, Minari, Lee Isaac Chung’s Korean-American immigrant drama and Kevin Macdonald’s Guantánamo thriller The Mauritanian. Meanwhile Chadwick Boseman, who took received a posthumous tribute award at the Gotham awards on Monday, was nominated for his lead role in Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom and his supporting role in Da 5 Bloods. Saint Maud’s Morfydd Clark was also mentioned more than once, as was Anthony Hopkins, Carey Mulligan, Riz Ahmed, Vanessa Kirby, Sacha Baron Cohen and Rocks’ Bukky Bakray. Ahmed was the surprise victor in the Gothams’ lead actor category for his role in Sound of Metal. That ceremony cemented Nomadland’s reputation as the film to beat this season; it has so far been named best film by a raft of film critic societies, as well as winning the top prize at both the Toronto and Venice film festivals, where it premiered last summer. The London critics’ circle film awards will be presented at a virtual ceremony on 7 February. The body has stuck to its usual spot in the awards calendar, unlike the Baftas, Golden Globes and Oscars, which have shifted their dates back a couple of months in response to the coronavirus pandemic.

Model-turned-actor Ruby Rose (Orange Is the New Black, John Wick: Chapter 2), is utterly mesmerising to look at – with her lush lips, perfectly shaped eyebrows and macho tattoos – but so far the jury is very much out on whether she can act more than merely adequately. This action vehicle doesn’t exactly strengthen the case for her defence, although she moves with impressive grace in the actiony bits when required in closeups that show her character, Ali, whupping bad guys’ asses. Rose is meant to be a former marine, haunted by a botched assignment that cost the lives of a family she was protecting. In the film’s present tense, she takes a job as a doorman – shouldn’t it be “lobby attendant” or even “doorperson”? – at a posh New York City building, only to wander accidentally into a heist that goes very wrong. A strangely immobile-featured Jean Reno offers an almost self-parodying turn as the snobbish yet brutal French mastermind of the criminal gang, who are looking for paintings looted by the Nazis years back. Ali must protect the husband (Rupert Evans), teenage son (Julian Feder) and irritatingly spunky daughter (Kíla Lord Cassidy) from harm – which involves a lot of skulking in the building’s secret passageways, making for a mostly one-set shoot that looks like it saved a lot on budget. Director Ryuhei Kitamura, whose career began with pulpy horror fare, directs with efficiency but a seeming total lack of awareness of how silly this all looks from a distance. There’s little humour or invention to leaven the deadened inertness of the script. • The Doorman is available from 18 January on digital platforms.	325
Over the last couple of decades, Danish cinema has increasingly proved to have a strong aptitude for emotive, nuanced drama and intelligent engagement, particularly through documentary-making, with conflicts abroad. This inspired-by-a-true-story feature, from journeyman director Niels Arden Oplev (who helmed the original Girl With the Dragon Tattoo film) skilfully combines those two strands to tell the story of Daniel Rye, a young Danish photographer who was captured by Isis in Syria in 2013. Filmed in a wiggly, handheld fashion – such a signature of the Dogma 95 years it almost feels like a retro affectation – the plot tracks methodically through Daniel’s story, holding tight on the expressive face of Esben Smed, who rises to the physical challenges of the role. For starters, he has to convincingly pass as Rye when he was young enough to be a contender for the Danish gymnastics team, although presumably a stuntman performed most of the acrobatics we see. In the film, after an injury ruins Rye’s sports career, a shift into photojournalism takes him to Syria where he falls into the hands of Isis, which was barely known at that time. They demand a multimillion-dollar ransom, but the Danish government sticks to its policy of not negotiating with terrorists. The film toggles smoothly back and forth between Rye’s family back home, scrabbling to raise the money without letting the story get into the press, and Rye himself in Syria. Oplev doesn’t shy away from the depiction of torture and suffering experienced by Rye and his fellow prisoners, one of whom was James Foley, an American journalist whose plight became an international story. Anyone who followed the news at the time will know the tragedies that lay ahead, but the point here isn’t what happened but it why. There’s empathy for all those scarred by this conflict, even in a strange way for John (Amir El-Masry), the British-accented Isis jailer who makes Rye’s life hell but is revealed in closeup to be consumed with his own kind of psychic pain. This is another film about a white European mixed up in a Middle Eastern war they barely seem to understand, but on its own terms it’s a story well told. • Daniel is available from 18 January on digital formats.	431
The first significant awards event of the current film cycle spread its net wide, but the main attention of the 2021 Gotham awards, designed to reward independent film-makers, was focused on a tearful speech given by Simone Ledward as she accepted an award on behalf of her late husband Chadwick Boseman. Boseman had been announced as a recipient of the Gothams’ annual tribute award, along with Viola Davis, Steve McQueen and Ryan Murphy. Ledward, whose marriage to Boseman was made public only after the actor’s death, said in her speech: “He was the most honest person I ever met … He was blessed to live many lives within his concentrated one. He harnessed the power of letting go and letting God’s love shine through. May we not let his conviction be in vain. It is my honour on behalf of my husband.” She added: “Chad … thank you. I love you. I am so proud of you. Keep shining your light on us.” Boseman was also nominated for best actor for his performance in Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, a biopic of the celebrated blues singer played by Davis. However, in the event the award went to Riz Ahmed for his role as a drummer with hearing problems in Sound of Metal, catapulting Ahmed into the wider awards race. There was another surprise win in the best actress category, with Nicole Beharie winning for her performance as a former pageant winner in Miss Juneteeth, defeating strong favourite Frances McDormand who had been nominated for festival hit Nomadland. However, Nomadland, the widely admired study of retiree victims of the 2008 financial crash directed by Chloé Zhao, did take two prizes – best feature and the audience award – making it the only film to claim more than one win on the night, cementing its status as an Oscar frontrunner. Michaela Coel’s I May Destroy You continued its remarkable run by picking up the breakthrough series – short format award.

Cinematic rethinks of classic fairytales, especially Red Riding Hood, are a micro-genre about as exasperating and banal as the “year X called and it wants its Y back” joke. In Hunted’s case insert, 1985 for X and “postmodern feminist trope” for Y. Nevertheless, this uncomfortable but adroitly executed horror version in which a young woman is chased through the woods by toxic male monsters is pretty good stuff: unnerving in the right ways and flecked with colourful, unexpected specks of wit. In what presumably must be rural Ireland given most of the supporting characters’ accents, Eve (Lucie Debay, feral and fierce) is a bit of an outsider, a French woman stuck in the middle of nowhere supervising the construction of a housing estate. A chance visit to a local bar brings her into the orbit of a charming, vulpine-featured nameless stranger who sounds American but is actually played by the French actor Arieh Worthalter. After he saves her from the aggressive attentions of another guy (Ciaran O’Brien), Eve lets down her guard only to find herself kidnapped by a psychotic, sadistic misogynist. Even worse, he’s a psychotic sadistic misogynist with a movie camera, and we all know how evil they are. From there on out, the rest of film is the narrative slap and tickle of escape-recapture as Eve, dressed in red duffel coat, tries to get away. She is in an ancient, soggy forest where there are a few other characters wandering around, ready to fill the roles of grandma and woodsman. But director Vincent Paronnaud, working from a script he co-wrote with Léa Pernollet and David H Pickering, adds a few kinks that divert the story from the tracks laid down by the fairytale origins. Thankfully, we only see glimpses of the footage of tortured women on the hideously believable nemesis’s camera, so ultimately the movie – just about – feels more like a critique of the character’s woman-hating mindset rather than a vehicle for it. Released on 14 January on Shudder.	388
The Tenet-style action “rewind” in Recon’s opening scene suggests this adaptation of Richard Bausch’s 2008 novel Peace, based on his grandfather’s wartime experiences, might offer more than the average second world war thriller. Don’t get your hopes up. There’s no time travel, nor multi-perspective narrative tricks, nor even an innovative depiction of trauma’s impact on memory. Recon takes place in just the single dimension of reality, and a rather leaden one at that. Alexander Ludwig (Vikings) stars as Marson, a US army corporal stationed somewhere in Italy, who is sent trudging into the mountains by a callous commanding officer on a pointless and potentially suicidal reconnaissance mission. He and his small crew are irritable, exhausted and haunted by a recently witnessed war crime, all of which they articulate at length as they struggle through the snow. Their guide is an elderly farmer (Franco Nero, AKA Mr Vanessa Redgrave; furnishing the film with some Italian suavity) who was unfortunate enough to have crossed their path. He may or may not be a secret Nazi sympathiser leading them into a trap, and his habit of mumbling, “I had a family … tutti morti,” doesn’t do much to allay suspicions. The soldiers’ chit-chat has some Catch-22-esque wit to it – especially when delivered by Marson’s Brooklyn-accented brother-in-arms Asch (a standout Chris Brochu). But there’s altogether too much of it. In a real combat situation, surely arguing this loudly about Hershey bars and baseball odds would have drawn the unwelcome attention of enemy forces, with deadly consequences. The fact that it doesn’t here saps any potential dramatic tension from the situation, notwithstanding all the unseen snipers and landmines they encounter. Bausch’s book has been praised for its existential profundity on religious matters, but very little of that makes it to the screen. • Recon is on digital platforms from 18 January.	372
The Dig is actually not a very earthy film, though there is intelligence and sensitivity and a good deal of English restraint and English charm, thoroughly embodied by the fine leading performers Carey Mulligan and Ralph Fiennes. But the passions mostly stay buried, and the movie is disconcertingly structured in such a way that we are first asked to invest in these two intriguingly complex personalities, but then – just when their emotions might get disinterred – the focus shifts to a younger pair with more obvious romantic potential, played by Johnny Flynn and Lily James. Mulligan and Fiennes look like two characters who have been written out of their own soap opera. This doesn’t stop The Dig being engaging, and with a beautiful sense of landscape. It is based on the true story of the sensational Sutton Hoo excavation in Suffolk on the eve of the second world war; an Anglo-Saxon burial ship was found by the self-taught working-class archaeologist Basil Brown, whose historic discovery the academic establishment instantly tried to appropriate, without credit. He had been hired by the local landowner and widow Edith Pretty, who had long nursed an instinct that there was something in the “mounds” on her property. The movie is vigorously adapted by screenwriter Moira Buffini from the 2007 novel by journalist and author John Preston – whose aunt Margaret Piggott was involved in the dig. Ralph Fiennes plays Brown, a tough, self-reliant man of few words and an outdoor tan, who does a fair bit of pipe-filling, pipe-smoking and pipe-biting. Fiennes plays him as someone who knows his worth, and he insists on getting two pounds a week from Mrs Pretty for his work and for his lifetime’s knowledge. Mulligan is Edith Pretty: intelligent, beautiful, lonely and mysteriously moved by what Brown is uncovering and by Brown’s own quietly messianic sense of purpose. But then the grand folk from London arrive, intent on taking possession of their precious discovery: Ken Stott is on great form as the pompous British Museum archaeologist Charles Phillips, his face as fierce and red as a toby jug. But along with Phillips is the mousy scholar Stuart Piggott (Ben Chaplin), a dull fellow who is failing to satisfy his young wife Margaret (Lily James) emotionally. And she is attracted to Edith’s (fictional) cousin Rory (Johnny Flynn). Of course, the idea of digging up the past and dredging up what has been emotionally buried in one’s heart saturates the entire film. A Suffolk local takes a dim view of Edith’s encouragement of Brown and remarks that he “should leave Mrs Pretty’s mounds alone!” That’s the Finbarr Saunders school of metaphor. But actually, in that vulgar figurative sense, he pretty much does leave Mrs Pretty’s mounds alone. Her tentative offer of dinner is complicated by the fact that Basil is married to a woman called May, shrewdly played by Monica Dolan, and there is also a secret sadness and vulnerability in Edith’s own heart that would appear to preclude any such developments, though Mrs Pretty’s young son Robert (Archie Barnes) might well be seeing Basil as a father figure. This movie has Englishness right through it like a stick of rock, a vigorous sense of place and period, though it’s in the vein of hardback/tasteful cinema that’s a bit of a Brit movie cliche. Carey Mulligan gets the traditional hat-and-coat walk through the busy wartime London streets that was awarded to Gemma Arterton in Their Finest and Keira Knightley in The Imitation Game. The story itself is rooted in the robust literary tradition of LP Hartley, Bruce Chatwin, Graham Swift and Ian McEwan – with some Larkinian musing at the end about what will survive of us in a thousand years. Margaret tells Rory that in their case, it will the metal wheels in his watch and perhaps some fragments of their china tea mugs. No nonsense about love. The first act about Edith and Basil is arresting and the discovery scene is great – but where will their relationship go? The second act gives us a young love story with much less depth. But maybe that is the point. Edith and Basil have their moment and it is destined to be buried by the newcomers and the vast obliterative forces of history. • The Dig is released on Netflix on 29 January.	824
The classic Noël Coward comedy about a ghost (first filmed by David Lean in 1945 with Rex Harrison) has now been adapted again, with stage and TV director Edward Hall making his movie debut. It can only be described as an un-reinvention, a tired, dated and unfunny period piece that changes the original plot a bit but offers no new perspective, and no new reason to be doing it in the first place. (Not compared with, say, Matthew Warchus’s stage revival of Coward’s Present Laughter at the Old Vic, with Andrew Scott radically reinventing the leading role.) This film looks unironically like the tatty old musical revue show that Ken Russell imagined for his “meta” adaptation of The Boy Friend. Dan Stevens plays crime writer Charles Condomine, who has been creatively blocked since the death of his first wife Elvira (Leslie Mann) seven years before, and now tensely remarried to the more uptight Ruth (Isla Fisher). He has the idea of putting a spiritualist into the new movie screenplay he’s working on, and invites a notorious stage medium, Madame Arcati (Judi Dench), to his house to perform a seance, so that he can do some research into the wiles of these confidence tricksters. But, to his astonishment (and Madame Arcati’s), the seance brings back the ghost of Elvira, who wreaks havoc. Despite the heavyweight cast, the film’s production values are those of a kids’ TV show that might go out on a weekday afternoon. Dench does her best with the role of Madame Arcati, and she even has a notably surreal moment, carrying out an occult ceremony in a beachside cave. But the rest is a festival of mugging and farcical overacting, and the Cowardian style seems brittle without any snap. • Blithe Spirit is on Sky Cinema from 15 January.	357
In the latest skirmish of the streaming wars, Netflix has come out fighting. In a star-studded promotional video, the studio announced a staggering slate of original releases in 2021, with a promise to release a new film every week this year. The studio’s level of productivity blows its competitors clean out of the water. In pre-Covid times, Warner Bros released 21 films in 2019, with Disney posting 19. True, the streamer doesn’t always have to contend with the additional costs associated with a theatrical release – or indeed the headache of cinemas not being open at all – but beneath the beaming smiles of its actors was a clear statement of intent. The past year has highlighted the fragility of a cinematic ecosystem which relies on blockbusters regularly making more than $400m to strike a profit and keep cinemas afloat. Netflix can’t yet claim to be the saviour of the cinematic experience, but it is undeniably giving the industry a major shot in the arm – and something approaching stability in profoundly unstable times – through a commitment to producing original content of all sizes. This year’s slate has its fair share of tent-pole releases. We will see the big-budget Red Notice, featuring Dwayne Johnson, Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot, released alongside the Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence-fuelled Don’t Look Up. But these are joined by films that lean much more into the company’s desire to increase the size of its awards cabinet. An adaptation of Booker prize winner The White Tiger stands out, while there is also the lockdown-inspired Malcolm and Marie. As ever with Netflix, the note of caution is whether this generous model is as inherently fragile as the distribution pattern it is disrupting. A house of glass to rival the House of Mouse. Clearly, it depends on huge growth, but up to now, the studio has consistently provided it. In the third quarter of 2020, the studio recorded $6.44bn in revenue, with the number of worldwide subscribers growing rapidly, yet this is all offset by a content bill which has been reported to be as high as $17.3bn in 2020. Combine this with the difficulty in ascertaining what each new release is worth in terms of attracting new subscribers and engaging others, and it may mean that Hollywood accounting has a new meaning. Netflix is evidently throwing a huge amount of money at original content creation, much like its rivals at Disney. Yet the streaming giant’s move in many ways runs counter to that of its competitor, which used its recent Investor Day to expand existing properties. Yes, Disney+’s slate for 2021 is full of new series and films, but they often exist within established cinematic universes. From The Book of Boba Fett and Star Wars through to Wandavision and Marvel, the studio is using its platform to appeal to a loyal and devoted fanbase. This is unsurprising given the two streamers are coming from opposite starting points. Disney was a film-making colossus long before it switched to streaming, while Netflix traditionally hinged on a competitive curation of others’ productions. As the two slide closer together, it makes logical sense that they are cleaving to their traditional strengths, with Netflix enlisting outside creatives and Disney bolstering existing IP (not to mention making the most of its big-money purchases). That said, the concluding chapters of To All the Boys … and The Kissing Booth nod towards Netflix’s increasing ability to string together film franchises, with sequels also mooted for the bigger-budget properties Extraction and The Old Guard. While the paths ahead for both Disney and Netflix are taking shape, the direction of competitors such as Warner Bros’ HBO Max is still buffering. The studio’s decision to move its 2021 slate on to their own streaming platform – alongside limited theatre runs – caused ire among creatives including Christopher Nolan and Patty Jenkins. Wracked by the fear of another year of closed cinemas, the kneejerk reaction has seemingly also jeopardised the future of Denis Villeneuve’s Dune as a franchise. Away from this turmoil, those who collaborate with Netflix know exactly what to expect, even if it isn’t the fanfare of a theatrical run. There will no doubt be concern that Netflix’s crowded slate will only reinforce TV and film’s saturated landscape. Gasping for publicity, films such as Mank, The Trial of the Chicago Seven and Da Five Bloods came and went on the platform. What’s more, Netflix’s increasing willingness to release some titles for short theatrical runs won’t be enough to single-handedly save cinema chains. But after a desperate year, their gargantuan support for the sector shouldn’t be undervalued.	883
Drug smuggler Hugo (Nicolas Fagerberg) has “the connect”. Or he’d like to think he does. Certainly this debut feature from British director Dan Moss knows several good spots, guiding us through a series of impressive locations with the confidence of a seasoned traveller. After Hugo’s big-money hashish deal in a partly flooded Mumbai building site goes wrong, he’s introduced to Bulu, a blue-powdered hallucinogen with mystical properties. “They say it makes you see the future,” says his go-between (Ashish Verma). Could this mysterious substance make Hugo enough money to satisfy his UK-based bosses? He’ll have to track down a supply source first. Everything about the London drug world that Hugo then stops off in – from the 80s punk get-ups of the big players to the readiness with which these supposedly shrewd operators approve Hugo’s wild goose chase – is risibly unrealistic. But he’s soon en route to “Fort Lugard, Uganda”, where the plot is on safer ground. The wise decision to employ locals where possible tells in the compelling specificity of the Ugandan settings and characters. Esther Tebandeke and Rehema Nanfuka are both excellent as, respectively, Kisakye, a village woman with access to the blue stuff and a healthy suspicion of Hugo, and Angela, Kisakye’s more worldly, scheming sister. Hugo is also a very believable example of the kind of straggly bearded adventure-seeker who’s convinced he’s blending in with the locals. Too believable, almost. These guys get tiresome after a 10-minute chat at the backpacker hostel bar, so why construct a whole film around his story? Especially with an abundance of more intriguing characters relegated to the margins. Imperial Blue aims at a knowing satire of colonial arrogance, yet still, somehow, it’s all about the white guy. Eurocentrism is one helluva drug. • Imperial Blue is available from 18 January on digital platforms.	369
Can an action film with a bold anti-war message also trade off the vicarious thrill of watching numerous bullet-strewn battle scenes? It’s an uneasy question whose answer depends on execution, whether the moral argument has space to pierce through the mayhem. The serviceable new Netflix action thriller Outside the Wire doesn’t make an entirely convincing case (its focus is more on firepower than brainpower) but even a messily handled big idea is at least something in a genre most often lacking in them, especially on a platform that churns out mindless guff on a weekly basis. In the near future, Harp (Damson Idris), a US drone pilot, is helping to fight a war in eastern Europe aided by “Gumps”, military machines trained to destroy the enemy and protect human soldiers. During one difficult evening, Harp makes a controversial decision and the resulting carnage takes him from behind a screen to out on the field, partnered up with Leo (Anthony Mackie), a notorious android officer, to show him what war is really like. But Harp soon finds out that Leo has something else on his mind. With a touch of Training Day, a smidgen of Eagle Eye, a dash of Eye in the Sky, a pinch of Ex Machina and an extra generous serving of all the Terminator films, Outside the Wire is losing every available award for originality, yet another Netflix creation born from its algorithmic cauldron, but taken on very basic low-stakes terms, it’s a competent enough January time-filler. Like many of the company’s wannabe blockbusters, on first glance it moves like it belongs at the multiplex, but it doesn’t take the quickest of viewers to spot that it’s just a few steps behind, a DTV action flick with a slightly bigger budget than the cheaper knockoffs it takes after. The director, Mikael Håfström (who enjoyed a brief run on the big screen with 1408, Derailed and The Rite), has just about enough experience to make it mostly work, motoring ahead with agility, aided immensely by his two leads. Idris, a British actor whose affecting work in the immigration drama Farming remains an early career high point, acquits himself with confidence in his first major lead role, the sort of duck-to-water performance that should have Marvel and Star Wars honchos taking notice. Although one hopes his career doesn’t become too populated by action fodder, as has become the case with Mackie, who always seems just a little bit better than the material he ends up with. While roles in Half Nelson, The Hurt Locker and Detroit have shown us just how much Mackie can do, too often he’s stuck in mindless running and shooting mode in dross like Triple 9 and the remakes of Point Blank and Miss Bala or lost in the chaos of the Avengers franchise. He’s as good as ever in this but it feels like a sleepwalk in the park at this stage. The ever-shifting dynamic between the pair holds our attention far more then the rather generic battle set pieces, Håfström content to make the film feel like a video game come to life. The blandness of the action, of which there’s quite a lot, perhaps works unintentionally in favour of the anti-war debate that starts to rage, showing us the repetitive pointlessness of it all. Sadly that doesn’t seem to be the objective here and so instead, the fetishistic sea of bullets that drowns the film works against any more noble discourse. There’s a more interesting film buried here and it’s the small nuggets of debate about the military and artificial intelligence that keep us going through the bloated, almost two-hour runtime. Giving Outside the Wire credit for gently broaching weightier subjects than the average Netflix action film is the faintest of praises, but with two magnetic performances (and strong work from the Cannes best actress winner Emily Beecham), it makes for an acceptable kick-off to what is poised to be the streamer’s biggest year yet. Let’s just hope it gets better than this. Outside the Wire is available on Netflix on 15 January	782
The very talented actor and musician Johnny Flynn here makes a perfectly game attempt to impersonate the young David Bowie in this ironised and fictionalised account of Bowie’s 1971 US publicity tour which – partly – inspired his Ziggy Stardust persona. Flynn carries off Bowie’s clothes and delicate mannerisms plausibly enough and, impressively, he does his own singing. But, all too often, this Bowie looks as if he is presenting TV’s Bake Off. Bowie arrived at Washington DC’s Dulles airport where an immigration official called him a “fag”, and where Mercury Records publicity man Ron Oberman (played here by comic Marc Maron) arrived to meet him, having got a lift to the airport from his mum and dad, and took the bemused Bowie back for a home-cooked family meal, like a 13-year-old foreign exchange student. The movie shows this, but where in reality the tour saw Bowie fly to major cities, meeting with Oberman a few times and doing interviews, the movie escalates this to a huge comedy-odd-couple road trip. Oberman and Bowie head across the country in Ron’s uncool, un-rock’n’roll station wagon, with Bowie playing disastrous, low-key gigs and Ron becoming a Spinal Tap-type PR goof who is mortified at the poor turnout. Meanwhile, back in London, Jena Malone plays the heavily pregnant Angie Bowie, who comes across as a charmlessly shrill and bad-tempered scold, and David is having traumatised flashback memories of his troubled brother Terry (Derek Moran). The movie makes a laboured connection between Terry’s mental illness and David’s dark imaginings, a connection that surely comes close to misunderstanding the nature of schizophrenia. And so the tour goes on, and Bowie providentially hears (or hears about) the music of Iggy Pop and cult psychobilly star Legendary Stardust Cowboy, which fed into the Ziggy Stardust creation. This is a strained, frustrating concoction that doesn’t do its subject justice. Flynn really can sing, though. • Stardust is available from 15 January on digital platforms.	388
Home Alone star Macaulay Culkin has endorsed social media comments demanding Donald Trump’s cameo in the film’s sequel be digitally removed and replaced with one of an older version of Culkin himself. Culkin replied to a tweet that asked “petition to digitally replace trump in ‘home alone 2’ with 40-year-old macaulay culkin” with the single word: “Sold.” Culkin then followed up by responding “Bravo” to another tweet that contained a comic edit of Trump replaced by empty space. Trump appears briefly in Home Alone 2: Lost in New York when Culkin, as its hero Kevin, asks him for directions to the lobby of the Plaza hotel, which Trump owned at the time. In an interview with Insider in December 2020, the film’s director Chris Columbus said that Trump “did bully his way into the movie” by insisting he get a role in the film in return for allowing shooting to take place in the hotel. Columbus added that Trump’s cameo was a popular move: “When we screened it for the first time the oddest thing happened – people cheered when Trump showed up on screen. So I said to my editor, ‘Leave him in the movie. It’s a moment for the audience.’” A petition on change.org to replace Trump with Joe Biden had accrued 189 signatures at time of publication.	259
Anger burns a hole through the screen in this stark monochrome picture from veteran director Andrei Konchalovsky: a gruelling re-enactment of the hushed-up Novocherkassk massacre in western Russia in 1962, when Red Army soldiers and KGB snipers opened fire on unarmed striking workers, killing an estimated 80 people. It was a day of spiritual nausea for the Soviet Union, which had only just entered Khrushchev’s new de-Stalinised era of supposed enlightenment – a postwar civilian bloodbath that was the Soviets’ Sharpeville, or Kent State, or Bloody Sunday, or indeed the Corpus Christi massacre in Mexico City that featured in Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma. Yuliya Vysotskaya – a longtime Konchalovsky player – plays Lyuda, a Communist party official and single mother who lives in a tiny flat in Novocherkassk with her 18-year-old daughter Svetka (Yuliya Burova) and grizzled old dad (Sergei Erlish). There are terrible food shortages, yet Lyuda is a loyal and uncomplaining party member who not so secretly pines for the good old days of Josef Stalin, when the Soviet Union was bathed in glorious wartime destiny and when things seemed to be better all round. Now she is having a furtive affair with a cynical and bleary married committee official who doesn’t even seem to like her very much. To the party’s uncomprehending disgust, a strike is triggered by exhausted workers’ rage at the sudden issue of lowered wages and food price rises and the party’s fatuous claim that this lethal combination will ease pressure on state finances and, therefore, create more plenty in the long term. There is horrifying chaos and slaughter: Svetka goes missing, and Lyuda embarks on a desperate quest to find her, dead or alive. What’s worse is that she has a party-loyalist reputation for endorsing precisely this kind of cruel crackdown and must suppress her secret anguish about her missing daughter and give an address to the party faithful beginning with the greeting: “Dorogie tovarishi!” (“Dear comrades!”) Konchalovsky clearly shows the incompetence, paranoia, bureaucracy and secrecy that created this mass murder. I found myself thinking about Craig Mazin’s recent TV drama Chernobyl. The same instincts are on display: to shut down the city, to cover everything up, smother everything and fail to understand. There is here an intense regional dislike of Novocherkassk and the whole area as the home of the untameable Cossacks and peasants. Lyuda’s father has grim memories of retributive local killings, and he reflects grimly on Mikhail Sholokhov’s And Quiet Flows the Don and its bitter vision. So much of the film’s pain is in that single word: comrade. (Lyuda keeps finding herself singing a rousing patriotic song from the movie that’s just been on TV: Grigory Alekandrov’s Spring, with its earnest chorus of, “Oh comrades, protect your motherland at all costs!”) The word denotes equality and brotherhood and anti-hierarchical idealism that does away with caste and class. In fact, the word functions as a sentimental kind of denial about the vertical structure of power everywhere, with everyone afraid of people above them – but also people below, who could snitch, or suddenly be promoted over them. There is a chilling moment after the massacre when a bewildered young woman is curtly told to sign an official document confirming that she will never reveal to anyone what has happened, but is then taken away, apparently to be executed, when the KGB official decides her behaviour at their brief interview has been unsatisfactory. This woman’s fate is, however, even stranger and scarier than we think. So the drama continues with officialdom blandly declaring that there will be a party with dancing that evening at 7pm, apparently to expunge any ill feeling, and also, given that the blood cannot be washed away from the asphalt and has somehow baked redly into it, a new layer of asphalt must be placed over it. On top of all this, Konchalovsky places an unexpected ending with its layer of bleak irony; it is a passionate drama of fear and rage. • Dear Comrades! is on Curzon Home Cinema from 15 January.	785
The FBI’s secret campaign of bugging, harassment and defamation against Martin Luther King Jr in the 60s is the subject of this startling but sometimes frustratingly reticent and guarded documentary. This poisonous dirty-tricks campaign continued until King’s assassination in Memphis in 1968, a murder that the bureau was somehow unable to prevent, despite its fanatical round-the-clock surveillance of King as well as its loudly proclaimed dedication to crimefighting. It is now a matter of record that King was a flawed human being and had extramarital sex, but this is an enduringly mysterious part of his public image. (Even Ava DuVernay’s very fine biopic account of King in her 2014 movie Selma, starring David Oyelowo, tactfully romanticises these indiscretions.) The bureau’s audio tapes of alleged meetings in hotel rooms were finally, in 1977, handed over to the National Archives by order of a federal judge but sealed – they cannot be released until 2027 at the earliest. What exactly will they prove? Anything at all? All we have right now are the typescripts of the agents’ highly subjective summary reports. This film from Sam Pollard, based largely on the work of Pulitzer-winning historian David J Garrow, shows how bizarrely toxic and dysfunctional the FBI’s campaign was, an ongoing secret war that involved running informants within the civil rights movement – a painful and even tragic aspect of this history that probably deserves a documentary of its own. Bureau director J Edgar Hoover was incensed by King’s leftist associations, and by his international celebrity, especially after he was awarded the Nobel peace prize in 1964. After chancing on evidence of his adultery, Hoover hoped to use this to undermine him, and with extraordinary spite circulated the tapes to King’s wife Coretta and even to church leaders and the press, apparently hoping (in vain) that someone would go public. There was even a suggestion that King was present at a rape – and this film, very gingerly indeed, comes close to hinting that there might one day be a #MeToo case to answer. But wait. Where is the proof here? Where is the naming of names? Surely the bureau, with all the dark powers at its command, could have induced one of King’s alleged mistresses to come forward and go public? Apparently not. It is a question that this film does not fully address, although it certainly gives us a queasily detailed picture of Hoover’s pure paranoid nastiness. • MLK/FBI is on digital platforms from 15 January.	479
British illustrator and visual-effects director Gavin Rothery makes his feature debut with this artificial intelligence thriller: a tale of love, death and robotics that has some nicely creepy moments. Set in 2038, it centres on lonely computer scientist George Almore (Divergent’s Theo James), who is holed up in a remote research facility in Japan secretly working on an android version of his wife Jules (Stacy Martin); she has died in a car crash. His prototype, J3 (also played by Martin), is his closest yet to the real thing: a highly advanced humanoid with spookily pale skin who looks like she might be the ghost of his dead wife. Poor old J1 and J2, his earlier, clunkier prototypes: they look on bitterly as the newer, sleeker model gets all George’s attention. The movie opens with sweeping helicopter shots over a snowy forest. Inside the concrete bunker-like facility, Rothery works wonders with a modest budget (he was behind the look of Duncan Jones’s Moon), creating an ungimmicky nearish future that looks a lot like today. When George’s corporate bosses threaten to pull the plug on his research, he hurries to put the finishing touches to J3 – a task involving the contents of a fridge-like archive unit containing his dead wife’s consciousness. George is surrounded by the robot versions of Jules. J1 is boxy, non-verbal and baby-like. J2 is a little more advanced: she can speak, and behaves like a teenager, huffing jealously when George removes her legs to give to J3. In the end, George is playing God – creating a woman not from a rib but electrical components and computer programming. The script’s take on this is romantic: here is a man who’ll do whatever it takes to be reunited with his wife. I couldn’t help finding it a bit more sinister; when J2 misbehaves, George orders her back to her docking station. He is in control. (Anyone for a posthuman wife? She comes with an off switch.) And the final ta-da revelation felt a bit contrived. Still, Archive is refreshingly non-cerebral – and that’s a compliment. It’s a sci-fi movie that wants to entertain, not deliver a lecture on AI. • On digital formats from 18 January.	443
Armie Hammer has dropped out of an upcoming film with Jennifer Lopez after messages allegedly sent by the actor were leaked online. Hammer has described the messages and social media response to them as an online attack, calling them vicious and spurious. Hammer, star of movies including The Social Network and Call Me By Your Name, had been set to appear opposite Lopez in action comedy Shotgun Wedding. However, he will no longer take the role. A production spokesman told the PA news agency: “Given the imminent start date of Shotgun Wedding, Armie has requested to step away from the film and we support him in his decision.” Hammer, 34, became the focus of social media commentary over the weekend after explicit and disturbing messages alleged to have been sent by him were circulated online. Hammer said in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter on Wednesday: “I’m not responding to these bullshit claims but in light of the vicious and spurious online attacks against me, I cannot in good conscience now leave my children for four months to shoot a film in the Dominican Republic. Lionsgate is supporting me in this and I’m grateful to them for that.” Shotgun Wedding will be directed by Pitch Perfect filmmaker Jason Moore and follows a couple who get cold feet before they are due to walk down the aisle. Things are complicated further when the wedding party is hijacked by criminals. Hammer played the Winklevoss twins in The Social Network and starred opposite Timothee Chalamet in acclaimed drama, Call Me By Your Name. He most recently appeared opposite Lily James in a Netflix adaptation of Rebecca. • With Press Association	307
When it comes to TV, Star Wars is sitting very pretty after the enormous success of Jon Favreau’s The Mandalorian, a space opera tour de force that has completely re-routed Disney’s vision for its long running saga. All of a sudden, we are due to see multiple enticing spin-offs centred on characters including Boba Fett, Ahsoka Tano and Cara Dune, which will eventually culminate in a grand crossover event involving the soft-hearted bounty hunter. Star Wars’ number one rule – that members of the Skywalker clan must be at the heart of all major events – has been Death Starred in less time than you can say: “Great shot kid, that’s one in a million!” But how about the big screen, where Star Wars began, and where – until very recently – it was always imagined the saga’s most vital moments would play out? Here, we find ourselves in a very different place, with the once promising sequel trilogy having ultimately disappointed due to a lack of fresh thinking and an approach to macro-storytelling more chaotic than a box of angry Krykna. This week we got the titbit of news that Marvel supremo Kevin Feige’s long-mooted Star Wars movie is still moving ahead, with Rick &amp; Morty producer Michael Waldron now on board to write the screenplay. Waldron is also writing Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, and is head writer on the upcoming Disney+ series Loki, starring Tom Hiddleston’s prince of mischief. In short, he’s being trusted with a whole heap of Disney-owned properties. Then there’s Rogue Squadron, the starfighter spin-off that Wonder Woman’s Patty Jenkins was recently tapped to direct, about which little is known other than it looks like another off-centre project. Finally, of the movies still thought to be on Lucasfilm’s current slate, there’s another untitled film from Jojo Rabbit’s Taika Waititi, about which very little is yet known. We do have – back on TV – upcoming shows based on the early lives of Obi-Wan Kenobi and Lando Calrissian. So it is not as if the Skywalker clan and their pals have been completely scrubbed from galactic history. But it would be a shock to see any of these films continuing where the messy and disappointing Rise of Skywalker left off. There was a sense, watching that movie, that Disney-era directors of Star Wars had become trapped by the overwhelming legacy of 40-plus years of space opera shenanigans, to the point that it made more sense to wipe the slate clean and start again with fresh story arcs, free of the terrible pressure inspired by legions of fans watching one’s every move. That’s precisely what Rian Johnson’s proposed new Star Wars trilogy was once intended to do, prior to The Mandalorian changing everything. The Last Jedi film-maker was announced in November 2017 as the director of a new triptych set in an as-yet-undiscovered corner of a galaxy far, far away. But very little has been heard about these movies since October 2019, when Johnson cryptically told Entertainment Tonight he would still be “thrilled if it happens”. That’s a pity, for divisive as The Last Jedi turned out to be, it was still the only film in the sequel trilogy to really try to shake up the saga. The worry is that Johnson’s ideas might no longer sit in the sweet spot where Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy currently sees the saga going, which seems to be centred on either the Mandalorian-verse or fan-friendly nods to supporting characters from the original trilogy. The basic plan seems to be a shift into what we can only refer to as a kind of Hollywood populism: taking anything that has worked in previous Star Wars ventures and expanding on it. This is why Donald Glover is returning as cocky smuggler Calrissian (as pretty much the only character in Solo: A Star Wars Story that fans really took to), and Rogue One’s Diego Luna is back as Cassian Andor for his own Disney+ spin-off. And yet, if the future of Star Wars is to match its glorious past, we need something more than this cosy, reactive creativity. We know nothing about the grand plan for the big screen – will all these new movies exist within the same timeline, so that their major players can be brought together Marvel-style for another grand space opera smackdown? Or will Star Wars remain content to play out in the margins for the time being? For those of us who witnessed the mess Lucasfilm made of the over-ambitious sequel trilogy, such short-term thinking might seem a safer bet than the alternative. And yet at some point the Disney-owned studio will need to find a way to mirror the success of the original trilogy by telling a multiple-episode tale that transports us once again to the whirling, mesmeric cosmic playground of our dreams, to a galaxy that seemed creatively limitless. It doesn’t seem like too much to ask – just don’t bring back Emperor Palpatine yet again or we’ll have to feed you to the krayt dragon.	960
With the levels of global hysteria that had built up around the 1999 release of Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace, it was always destined to disappoint. Initial reviews of the film were actually sort of positive. Critics picked up on the fact that a story about trade taxation was a bit flat, in the same way a date with a bank manager is a bit flat; that the dialogue was ripe; that Jar Jar Binks – the CGI comic relief intended to give the toy companies something to sell – was, unforgivably, not funny. But it had Jedi, spaceship battles, it looked staggering, and the consensus was that it had set up a fresh trilogy fairly ably. Job done, then. Or so it seemed. In the months following the movie’s release, opinion shifted. The wow-factor of the CGI rubbed away, revealing the creaky bones of the film beneath. Questions were asked of the relevance of the CGI aliens’ accents, from the Caribbean patois of Jar Jar and the south-east Asian timbre of the Trade Federation Neimoidians to the slave-owner Watto, who was accused of being equally offensive to both Arabs and Jews. (George Lucas strenuously denied any racial stereotyping, making these elements of the film, at best, bewildering oversights.) Special hatred was reserved for Jar Jar, played by Ahmed Best, and for young Anakin Skywalker (the then nine-year-old Jake Lloyd). In the early days of the internet, both actors were unprepared for the now sadly commonplace levels of abuse the toxic side of fandom can discharge. All of a sudden, The Phantom Menace was loathed. (“I had death threats,” Best said later. “I had people come to me and say, ‘You destroyed my childhood.’”) It would be impossible to stage a defence of the film without at least addressing its faults, which are certainly legion. Jar Jar is the main culprit, but on reflection, he’s little more than an occasional annoyance. He’s goofy. Kids like him. He’s hardly the film’s protagonist. So it’s no great challenge to ignore him. Likewise, the odd “yippee!” aside, Anakin isn’t half as irritating when seen at a cool remove of 22 years after the fact. He’s merely one of an entire ensemble of characters without a single definable personality trait between them. Throughout the film, scenes seem to linger for a few awkward seconds after they should, or cease abruptly without any purpose for their existence having been established. There’s also an uncanny weightlessness to much of the CGI. In fact, from editing to dialogue to plotting, some of the nuts-and-bolts film-making on show is, frankly, baffling. But there is – there is! – a great movie lurking beneath all this. The sheer amount of world-building is remarkable: in one film we are introduced to the whole power structure of the galaxy before The Empire: a Republic, a Senate, a Jedi Council, Coruscant, Naboo and the Gungan city, and we are reintroduced to lawless Outer Rim planets like Tatooine. We see how it all works, and witness actual, jobbing Jedi going about their Forcey business in the inexorable run-up to war. It all whips along at a fair old clip. And the action set pieces are peerless. The pod race is an astounding assault of speed and noise. The land and space sorties are as good as anything the original trilogy managed, if a little inert in their lack of overall stakes. And the lightsaber battles remain the best of any Star Wars film to date. Darth Maul is the coolest baddie Star Wars ever gave us, and the athleticism he brings to the previously stiff duels has yet to be bested. Attack of the Clones features some of the blandest CGI action ever filmed, and a love story so lumpenly delivered it makes you wonder whether George Lucas has actually ever met another human being, let alone courted one. And Revenge of the Sith, while bringing the trilogy to a generally satisfying close, is festooned with the hokiest dialogue this side of The Room. (One climactic scene genuinely features the lines “The Sith are evil!” “From my point of view, the Jedi are evil!”) The Phantom Menace, though, isn’t bad at all. Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor are excellent. It tells a satisfying, enclosed story. Its action is handled with zip and flair. And, from the death of Qui-Gon to Anakin’s mother giving him up, it even manages to tug on the old heartstrings occasionally. Gungans notwithstanding, it is a very solid Star Wars film. Is it a classic? Goodness, no. But if you haven’t seen it since you left that movie theatre in 1999 with your hands clenched in tight white fists of fury, you may find yourself pleasantly surprised. Don’t be afraid. Remember: fear leads to anger … Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace is available to watch on Disney+ in the US and UK	977
Sam Pollard’s archive documentary cleverly uses the FBI’s pursuit of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr to tell the entwined history of leftwing protest and state-sanctioned surveillance. Former FBI director J Edgar Hoover feared “the rise of a black messiah” would disrupt the segregated status quo, and so set out to use information about King’s private life, such as his extramarital affairs, to discredit his public persona. Pollard includes clips from movies such as Big Jim McLain and The FBI Story to show how the bureau infiltrated pop culture to cultivate an image of itself as “reasonable, sane and patriotic”. MLK/FBI reframes this as propaganda, and shows how King’s antiracist project was viewed as anti-American political dissent. Pollard’s decision to eschew traditional talking heads in favour of voiceover interviews allows the archive to take centre stage. The director first looked at King in an episode of PBS’s Peabody award-winning Eyes on the Prize II in 1990. Thirty years later, his life remains rich terrain for Pollard, who is keen to consider him as a complicated and fallible man rather than an untouchable icon. • MLK/FBI is available on multiple VOD platforms	222
This asinine adaptation of Noël Coward’s 1941 stage play stars Downton Abbey’s Dan Stevens as author Charles Condomine, who accidentally summons the playful ghost of his late first wife after participating in an ill-advised seance. Stevens plays Condomine as a cliche of a blocked writer, emboldened by booze and misogyny, knee-deep in discarded drafts of a screenplay based on his bestselling crime novel. Edward Hall’s film attempts to send up Condomine for leeching off a female muse, which clashes somewhat with the source material’s “blithe” mood. The impish Leslie Mann is well cast as his dead wife, Elvira, who provides a jolt of creative inspiration. Judi Dench’s screechy caricature of psychic Madame Arcati is less winning. On Sky Cinema	142
The year is 1971 and David Bowie (Johnny Flynn) is about to embark on his first US tour. Except he only has a tourist visa and so he’s not supposed to perform – convenient, given that the film-makers were unable to secure the rights to any of Bowie’s original music. Its omission is noticeably awkward, with Flynn doing inert versions of tracks Bowie covered, such as Jacques Brel’s My Death, as a clumsy workaround. The narrative centres around a supposedly formative road trip Bowie took with his American publicist Ron Oberman (Marc Maron), suggesting that encounters with Andy Warhol and the Velvet Underground helped give birth to Bowie’s alter ego Ziggy Stardust. Troublingly, flashbacks that look at Bowie’s relationship with his half-brother Terry Burns (Derek Moran) imply that the singer’s family history of psychosis also played a significant part in the creation of his onstage persona. A title card indicates that the film is fictionalised and so perhaps shouldn’t be scrutinised for fidelity. Still, the whole thing feels strangely pedestrian, unable to capture or channel Bowie’s maverick spirit. Available on multiple VOD platforms	220
Veteran film-maker, screenwriter, theatre and TV director Andrei Konchalovsky’s career is nothing if not eclectic. He co-wrote Tarkovsky’s 1966 classic Andrei Rublev, while his directorial CV ranges from an acclaimed 1970 adaptation of Chekhov’s Uncle Vanya to Venice prize winners The Postman’s White Nights and Paradise, via the Kurosawa-originated white-knuckle thriller Runaway Train and the ill-fated Hollywood buddy cop action film Tango &amp; Cash, from which he was removed mid-shoot. Konchalovsky’s latest (once again feted at Venice) is among his finest work, a harrowing drama set in 1962, in the provincial USSR town of Novocherkassk. Julia Vysotskaya plays Lyudmila (AKA Lyuda), a stalwart party official who served as a battlefield nurse during the second world war, and who retains a nostalgic devotion to Stalinist ideals in the age of Khrushchev. “What am I supposed to believe in if not communism?” Lyuda asks, as her political devotions are challenged in the fallout of a factory strike and protest, to which the army and/or KGB (precise attribution is a thorny issue to be wrestled with) respond with deadly force. As the authorities rush to cover up a state-sponsored atrocity, Lyuda searches for her missing teenage daughter, Svetka (Yulia Burova), for whose life she fears in the wake of terrible violence. The horrifying events in Novocherkassk upon which Dear Comrades! is based (briefly reported in Solzhenitsyn’s The Gulag Archipelago) were not officially acknowledged or investigated for 30 years. Significant, then, that Yuri Bagrayev, who led the investigator’s team in 1992, acted as a consultant on the script, co-written by Konchalovsky and Elena Kiseleva. Meanwhile, Konchalovksy cites films such as Mikhail Kalatozov’s The Cranes Are Flying and Grigori Chukhrai’s Ballad of a Soldier as stylistic reference points for his disturbingly handsome feature, which presents its bleakly crisp black-and-white images in a retro 4x3 frame. Seamlessly blending exterior shots of Novocherkassk with grand sets constructed in Moscow, Konchalovsky creates an utterly convincing air of mounting chaos, brilliantly captured on multiple cameras marshalled by cinematographer Andrey Naydenov. Yet this is no Paul Greengrass-style exercise in frenetic docu-fiction, spurred on by a blur of handheld footage. On the contrary, Naydenov and Konchalovsky opt for an eerie stillness that bizarrely amplifies the film’s impact. Amid the increasingly confused cacophony of unfolding events, the comparative calm of the visuals strikes a horribly threatening chord. Despite the true grit of its historical setting, it’s the personal story of Lyuda’s journey from stoical party hardliner to frantically aggrieved mother that draws the audience in. Vysotskaya is terrific in the central role, capturing both the dreams and disillusionment of a character who strives to repress, rather than express, her emotions, offering a staunch face to the world even when confronting an unimaginable reality. Whether she’s struggling to control her fear in a hospital or in the toilet fending off silent screams, Lyuda’s predicament is made all the more affecting by Vysotskaya’s ability to convey great turmoil with minimal action. Throughout, Konchalovsky juxtaposes wide-ranging events with seemingly insignificant details to dramatic effect. In an early scene, a hole in Svetka’s sock proves no more than a scolding distraction; later it will return in gut-wrenching form, having assumed catastrophic significance. There’s a similar tension at play in the film’s pointed use of song, with patriotic tunes evoked to devastating effect during moments of desperation in a manner that reminded me of Pawel Pawlikowski’s Cold War. Here, the chilliness of the story is shot through with an unexpected warmth that ensures immediate emotional engagement with distant events. • On Curzon Home Cinema	699
Stanley Kubrick’s enigmatic film 2001: A Space Odyssey has posed a puzzle from the first. The unsettling story of a manned space journey to Jupiter, it continues to intrigue audiences 50 years after its release. But now, thanks to a small British record label, a “lost” original song, commissioned especially for the film but never used, is winning admiration from fans for the way it catches the flavour of a cinematic one-off. “I gave the song what I believe is its first airplay on my Scala Radio show a few weeks back,” said Mark Kermode, the Observer’s film critic. “Audience reaction was utterly polarised, but I have the suspicion it will become a cult favourite. It is very ear-wormy.” Speaking to the Observer from California, the song’s composer, Mike Kaplan, a film-industry veteran and Kubrick’s former long-time publicist, said he is astonished to find a piece of music he put his heart into all those years ago is belatedly gaining airtime following its release as a single a few weeks ago by Bristol-based Wave Theory Records. “I know it doesn’t sound like anything else, and I am not sure how I managed to work it out,” said Kaplan, 77. “I could never do it again. But it is great to hear it being played.” The publicist was challenged to write the song, 2001: A Garden of Personal Mirrors, during a meeting with Kubrick and MGM records after they had all listened to the demo tape of another song that had been intended to help promote the film. Declining to use the downbeat tune, Kubrick turned to Kaplan, who he knew wrote music and who he felt understood his film: “I hear you write music. Why don’t you write something?” he said, according to Kaplan. After moonlighting on his day job to compose the song, Kaplan had it professionally mixed and sung by folk performer Naomi Gardner. “The intent was to capture the different responses 2001 was generating from audiences and the media, the many levels of interpretation and appreciation, from its hypnotic visuals to its metaphysical illuminations. We also wanted to instil curiosity among audiences who had not yet seen what was becoming a cultural phenomenon,” Kaplan has explained. He wanted to emulate the success of the quirky hit MacArthur Park, featuring Richard Harris, but when he played it to Kubrick the tinny reproduction on a portable machine did it no favours. Although the great director liked the title, he said he could not imagine it becoming a hit. The two friends never discussed the song again, although they continued to work together closely on A Clockwork Orange. Another composer, Alex North, also wrote a score for 2001, but Kubrick ultimately went for a classical work, Strauss’s Also Sprach Zarathustra. Kaplan first met Kubrick in 1968 in a projection booth, where the director was told that the team promoting 2001 were having a hard time working out how to sell it to audiences. “We were confronted with a metaphysical drama encompassing evolution, reincarnation, the beauty of space, the terror of science and the mystery of mankind that required critics and audiences to surrender to its unique rhythms,” Kaplan explained. “With a visual narrative that jumped millennia, the 161-minute epic [original running time] contained only 22 minutes of dialogue.” After a two-hour discussion about the film, they shook hands and a long friendship began. The composer Dan Jones, founder of Wave Theory Records, said: “Attempting to write any music for Kubrick would be a daunting task, as Alex North – and now we discover Mike Kaplan – were both to discover. I was immediately struck by Mike’s song. It exudes the spirit of the time of its creation in New York. Both North’s atmospheric score and this celebratory single stand on their own musical terms, revealed years after their creation; and both of them give clues to the complex creative interactions that Kubrick’s films distilled.”	770
Sheets in disarray, two lovers avoiding each other’s gaze; Swedish director David Färdmar opens his feature debut with an emotional bomb blast in a perfect white bedroom. “So you can’t even say it any more,” spits out Adrian (Björn Elgerd). Finally, Hampus (Jonathan Andersson) concedes: “I love you. But there is no more ‘we’.” Leaving the wounds hidden, this is a promisingly imposing opening scene – but Färdmar, as he charts the pair’s breakup, can’t fully flesh it out in a stiff and increasingly laboured LGBT drama. Initially, it’s a duel for moving-on supremacy. Adrian seems to take the early lead, hooking up with an ex, while Hampus appears the needier, tearfully manipulating him back into bed. But it’s Hampus who strikes out first on a new relationship, while Adrian – resentment weighing behind his eyes – remains hostage to the issues that sabotaged them in the first place. Seeking to give these intimate negotiations epic dimensions, Are We Lost Forever follows in the footsteps of Abdellatif Kechiche’s Blue Is the Warmest Colour, sharing the same taste for establishing its naturalistic credentials through explicit sex scenes. On the other hand, Färdmar struggles to deliver the dramatic money shots. Adrian’s control issues – obvious in the bedroom, and ably conveyed elsewhere by Elgerd’s watchful performance – are made clear. But the film isn’t focused enough to open this trait out into a compelling character study. The often-soapy exchanges in which Adrian masks his hurt before someone reaches across the table mean that the film’s initially well-braced rhythm starts to drag, while Färdmar’s rigid framings are a far cry from Kechiche’s limber entanglement with his lovers. Like its protagonist, Are We Lost Forever can’t break free. • Are We Lost Forever is released on 22 January on digital platforms.	369
One of the most surprising new avenues to have formed for celebrities over the course of the pandemic has been Cameo. For the uninitiated, Cameo is a service where celebrities can create personalised messages for their fans. For £75, Hodor from Game of Thrones will wish you a happy birthday or – if you have £750 lying around – Richard Dreyfuss will put on a Jaws shirt and struggle to pronounce your name. But maybe this isn’t enough for you. Maybe you want to find direct engagement, with a much bigger star than Cameo offers, and for free. If that’s the case, I can heartily endorse not liking a Russell Crowe movie. Because, even if it takes him a while, Crowe will do his best to respond to your criticism. And if you’re really lucky, he’ll sound like an out-of-touch bus stop crackpot in the process. Here’s what happened. On 9 January, Ian McNabb, frontman of The Icicle Works, wrote the following about the 2003 film Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World: “Lots of folk complaining about lack of sleep during the Pandemic. May I recommend Master And Commander starring the usually captivating, attention-grabbing Russell Crowe. I’ve never made it past the ten minute mark. You’re welcome. And thanks Russell.” The tweet began to pick up steam and, just nine days later, found its way to Crowe himself. Now, Russell Crowe is a very famous man who has almost three million followers. However, despite this he was unable to let the criticism sit. Instead, he narkily replied: “That’s the problem with kids these days. No focus. Peter Weirs film is brilliant. An exacting, detail oriented, epic tale of fidelity to Empire &amp; service, regardless of the cost. Incredible cinematography by Russell Boyd &amp; a majestic soundtrack. Definitely an adults movie.” As it happens, both parties are wrong here. Master and Commander was a perfectly adequate film, although I’d be surprised if anyone thought about it in any meaningful way from the moment the credits ended, but the important thing is that Crowe reacted. Again, not much new there. He reacted to Bafta editing a poem out of an acceptance speech by pinning a television executive to a wall and calling him a “motherfucker”. He reacted to poor hotel telephone coverage by throwing the telephone at a clerk’s face. This time it is different, because he did it on Twitter via the means of a “kids these days” rant. And this is brilliant. This is confirmation that Crowe is willing to share his generalised biases with the world, and all you have to do is have an opinion on one of his films. Perhaps you could write that Cinderella Man felt like such a deliberate piece of Oscar bait that it failed to be emotionally captivating, or that A Good Year felt shallow and redundant compared with its previous television adaptation, or that the promotional campaign for Unhinged was more entertaining than the film itself. Either way, there’s now a good chance that Crowe will respond by saying, “In my day children were taught to be seen but not heard”, or “We never used to wash our hands after going to the toilet when I was growing up, and it never did me any harm,” or “Is it just me or are Wagon Wheels getting smaller?” This could have huge repercussions. After all, Crowe is so influential that dozens of stars might start joining in. It’s the Twitter equivalent of the Law of Attraction. Tell the universe that you didn’t entirely love a film made 18 years ago, and the universe will tell the star to inform you that you are incorrect. Perhaps rolling your eyes at Bruce Almighty will bring Jim Carrey to your door. Perhaps frowning at Hulk will make Eric Bana say hello to you. Perhaps, if you’re really mean about Maid in Manhattan, Ralph Fiennes will create a Twitter account specifically to call you a prick. And anyway, Crowe is right. Kids these days are to blame for everything. Kids have got no attention spans. Kids only like superhero movies. Kids can’t sit through a ponderously slow film about boats because they’d rather be watching an unboxing video on YouTube. Kids won’t watch a film that doesn’t have any sequels, even if it has been deliberately titled to make it look like the first part of a new and exciting maritime franchise. Kids eat candy. Kids make too much noise. Kids are responsible for everything bad in the world. Ian McNabb is 60 years old.	905
Heroes Don’t Die is the second recent film – after Quentin Dupieux’s absurdist Deerskin, also due in the UK in 2021 – in which French high-flyer Adèle Haenel gets behind a camera to soothe a wounded male ego. Here she plays film-maker Alice, who decides to humour her friend Joachim (Jonathan Couzinié) who, after being collared in a Paris street by an angry Slav, comes to believe he is the reincarnation of Zoran, a Bosnian soldier who died on 21 August 1983 – the day he was born. The pair pack the digicam and head Balkans-ward to track down the truth. Debut director Aude Léa Rapin, co-writing with Couzinié, reaches for Nouvelle Vague-like sprightliness with this meta-filmic setup. But it has the unfortunate effect of spotlighting Heroes Don’t Die’s self-regard and hesitancy over what form to take. If it’s satirising first-person documentaries, it doesn’t keep that subject in sharp focus. The character-study element, as Alice begins to doubt Joachim’s sincerity about his belief in reincarnation, feels expedient. It engages only sketchily with Bosnian history: it situates its story in Bratunac, the next town over from Srebenica. This tempting proximity to seriousness, when a war widow draws parallels between her and Joachim’s situations, leads Rapin towards borderline misjudged musings (“It’s good to tell yourself stories.”) Haenel, the film’s moral centre, is capable of both the Clintonian hauteur she showed in Portrait of a Lady on Fire and a gabbling, caffeinated over-seriousness used to fine effect in 2018 French comedy hit En liberté!, but this film leaves her dashing between the two poles. True to form, though, for the film’s slightly maddening inconsistency, in the final 10 minutes – as Joachim encounters a peasant woman who may or may not be the dead soldier’s wife – a gripping, almost wordless scene delivers pathos, thematic depth and a poetic kick from a glorious Bosnian hillside all at once. Otherwise, it is a largely frustrating exercise; sometimes history is best left in the backdrop. • Heroes Don’t Die is on Mubi from 21 January.	410
Film and TV crew are no longer exempt from coronavirus restrictions related to job travel, it has emerged. The UK government’s list of jobs that qualify for travel exemptions has been updated to remove “television production” and “high end television production and film”, which means that executives and crew arriving in the UK will have to isolate for 10 days. The move is a reversal of the widely publicised policy that saw film-makers and crew allowed into the UK in July without quarantine as part of a government drive to get film production in the UK back up and running. Culture secretary Oliver Dowden had made the announcement after apparently consulting with Tom Cruise, whose Mission Impossible films were among the Hollywood productions to restart shooting in the UK in September. Other productions likely to be affected include The Batman, starring Robert Pattinson, which had been halted for two weeks in September after Pattinson tested positive for coronavirus. The only media-related job on the government’s list still exempt from travel restrictions appears to be workers on the BBC’s broadcasting transmission network and services.	204
In the Guide’s weekly Solved! column, we look into a crucial pop-culture question you’ve been burning to know the answer to – and settle it, once and for all Anyone who grew up in the 1980s knew the Russian roulette thrill of watching a PG-rated film. What might have appeared tame on the surface could also contain hearts being ripped from sacrificial victims (Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom), potty-mouthed children (The Goonies), serious kink (Flash Gordon), alligators biting off limbs (Romancing the Stone), children killed by sharks (Jaws), James Bond cheerfully throttling a woman with her bikini top (Diamonds Are Forever), Sylvester Stallone taking ludicrously severe beatings (the Rocky films), or even paranormal investigators being, er, “pleasured” by departed spirits (Ghostbusters). In recent years, though, all of the above, plus other films of that era including Out of Africa and The Mission, have had their PG certificates revoked and replaced with 12A or 12 on DVD and streaming services. Now, if an under-12 wants to see any of the risky business above, they must do so with an adult in tow. So why the change? According to the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC), these films were often classified PG at the time because the leap to the next category, 15, was too great. Conversely, some films clearly aimed at gore-happy children ended up as 15s (Gremlins, for instance, which is now a 12A). But on the whole, when introduced in the early 80s, PG covered a multitude of sins, even when censorial scissors were ineffectually deployed: Temple of Doom remains seriously dark, despite the cuts made for PG. “Some scenes might not be suitable for young children,” was once advice parents carefully considered. If they rolled the dice and took the kids, it was on them, not the BBFC. Then, in 1989, the 12 certificate was introduced. Mildly scary blockbusters such as Jurassic Park (1993) and The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) were classified PG rather than 12 by the skin of their teeth. But when Spider-Man got a 12 in 2002, parents complained they couldn’t take their young children, resulting in local councils overruling the BBFC. In response, the BBFC trialled a 12A scheme, meaning children under 12 could be admitted if accompanied by an adult. It was a success, and the 12A rating became widespread. The new rating effectively ended the era of cavalier PG ratings, and gave censors a new category to retroactively use for films that had previously pushed the boundaries. Today, PG has a much stricter top end, meaning a milder parental warning. So will today’s children get the same opportunities to widen their cinematic horizons? Is the BBFC’s stringent modern PG criterion an emblem for a mollycoddled generation? In a sense, yes. The BBFC regularly surveys more than 10,000 people, then modifies classification guidelines to reflect public opinion. These consultations act as a way of making the BBFC accountable. Today it isn’t just sex, violence and swearing causing parental concern, but sexism, racism and discrimination in general, all of which could be present in PG films from less enlightened times. Besides, 12A also allows previously cut material to be reinstated (as with Temple of Doom). Hardly mollycoddling, or nanny-state censorship. But under revised BBFC guidelines, definitely not PG.	666
Here is an intriguing, bewildering fragment of what might be called underground new-wave cinema from Moroccan director Mostafa Derkaoui: a docu-fiction shown once in Paris in 1975, but then immediately banned by the Moroccan government after which it disappeared from view, resurfacing in 2016 when a negative was found in the archives of Filmoteca De Catalunya in Barcelona. Derkaoui and a group of other young film-makers are shown hanging out in Casablanca, in a bar and on the streets and at the port, interviewing people about what they think cinema should be doing. Long scenes in bars spool past, apparently semi-improvised, in which the film-makers and their interviewees get very drunk, among lots of other drunk people who are always on the verge of an argument or a fist fight They occasionally ask young women in the bar what they think about cinema and shamelessly tell them they are beautiful enough to be in the movies, asking for their contact details. Then they realise that one of the guys they have interviewed, a man at the port who had claimed to be a teacher, was in fact a dockworker, who had tried to kill his boss – a mob racketeer who was taking most of this man’s pay. And so there are more long conversations (only deadly serious and sober, this time) about whether they can include this footage, about whether this makes them complicit in a crime, or whether this is not an opportunity for precisely the kind of socially engaged cinema they’ve been yearning for. It’s not clear how much of this is real and how much fiction: the entirety of the “murder” may be a reconstruction of a real case. An interesting archive oddity. • About Some Meaningless Events is available on Mubi from 20 January.	334
A group of the film industry’s most high-profile and influential names – including Steve McQueen, Bond producer Barbara Broccoli and Danny Boyle – have published an open letter calling for more government support for the large cinema chains whose businesses have been threatened during the pandemic. The letter says that “cinema-going offers proven benefits when it comes to jobs, high-street footfall and community cohesion” but that “the need for direct financial support is pressing”. The letter is designed to support what it describes as the “larger cinema operators”, which include Odeon, Cineworld and Showcase, without whom “the future of the entire UK film industry would look extremely precarious”. The letter adds: “We very much hope that government will respond to this call. UK cinema stands on the edge of an abyss. We urgently need targeted funding support to ensure that future generations can enjoy the magic of cinema.” As well as McQueen, Broccoli and Boyle, the letter is signed by directors Amma Asante, Gurinder Chadha, Paul Greengrass and Christopher Nolan, producers David Heyman and Elizabeth Karlsen, and actors Jude Law and Stephen Fry. Virtually all cinemas are currently shut across the UK under tier 4 restrictions, leading to widespread release delays and sharply reduced revenue, with box-office analyst Comscore reporting a 76% drop in takings for 2020 as a direct result of the pandemic. The larger operators have been hit particularly hard, with the disappearance of Hollywood releases and the difficulties of ensuring their venues are Covid-safe, even when they were allowed to reopen in the summer and autumn. Phil Clapp, the chief executive of the UK Cinema Association, says: “While all cinemas have been able to benefit from general business support during this time, including the furlough scheme and a business rates holiday, many of the larger operators in particular have been required to continue to pay rental on their commercial tenancies as well as the other costs that come with running physical buildings.” The Culture Recovery Fund has provided support for smaller independent cinemas, but Clapp says that the large commercial chains – which together generate 80% of the UK audiences – have received no specific support. “As of now, there seems little likelihood that they will be able to open until this coming March, representing almost a year of closure. The resulting ‘revenue gap’ experienced by UK cinemas means that the continued operation of many cinema venues is now in question. We are asking government to look again at the support it has provided to the sector, in particular for the larger operators. “Given the differing nature of their business operations, there is unlikely to be a ‘one size fits all’ approach, but we are asking the Treasury to come back to the table for further discussions on what targeted funding might help ensure the survival of the industry.”	535
Japanese animation is the envy of the globe. From Pixar to Aardman, studios the world over ape its dazzling variety and astonishing creativity. Yet it also finds itself at a crossroad. Now master director Hayao Miyazaki has left the stage, where will the next Japanimation genius going to come from? As it turns out, the country’s most exciting works aren’t coming out of Disney-sized production powerhouses such as Miyazaki’s Studio Ghibli, but from a desk underneath a bunk bed at a family home in Kyoto. This auteur goes by the mononym Ujicha – named after the distinctive green tea grown in the fields near Uji, Kyoto, where he grew up. And, like the verdant plantations that were the backdrop to his childhood, Ujicha’s work, too, is rich with the kind of warm, bright tones you might find on the cover of a children’s storybook. With up to 3,000 lovingly illustrated, hand-sized props crafted by hand for both of his two feature films, his work is certainly painstaking. But it’s the unique, hybrid animation style that is unlike anything else out there. A rough guiding point might be the stop-motion, cutout animation of Monty Python or early South Park, but Ujicha’s style goes much further. With a penchant for pocket-size wildlife photography (“I really do like insects,” he says over Zoom), it’s clear where his influences lie. Ujicha’s cardboard miniatures are filmed in real time (on a store-bought FujiFilm camera) and moved by hand across richly textured backdrops. Like a cross between a Punch and Judy puppet show and a children’s pop-up book, these productions boast real dynamism, as fire, water, light and smoke collide with cardboard, creating the kind of theatrics usually reserved for live-action cinema. Ujicha explains that “gekimation” – derived from the Japanese word gekiga, used to describe adult-aimed manga – started in 1976, a decade before the thirtysomething Kyoto Saga Art University graduate was born, with a TV series called Cat-Eyed Boy. “They wanted to do something different,” he says. But aside from a handful of music videos (such as Denki Groove’s 2008 single Mononoke Dance), the style fell into obscurity. “It was just forgotten about,” Ujicha says. “I wanted to revive it.” At first glance, Ujicha’s films may resemble childlike fantasies, but The Famous Five they are not. The Burning Buddha Man and Violence Voyager offer something wholly more disturbing. They are visceral, Lovecraftian stories built on grotesque Cronenbergian body horror, whose discomfiting feeling is enhanced by the hybrid animation style. As the trailer for the former suggests, they combine “art” and “nightmare”. The Burning Buddha Man claims to be the first feature-length gekimation film, taking three years to complete. It is a bizarre, beautiful fantasy in which Buddha statues are given an HR Giger-esque makeover, as Cthulhu-like demons wreak havoc in Kyoto. The film won the excellence award at the Japan Media Arts festival in 2013, but it was with follow-up Violence Voyager that Ujicha staked his claim as a creative force. Inspired by Jurassic Park and Edogawa Ranpo’s The Strange Tale of Panorama Island, Violence Voyager follows schoolboy Bobby and his cat Derrick on a whimsical adventure into the wilderness, where they stumble on a strange amusement park that seems to be responsible for a number of disappearances. What initially feels like The Goonies soon takes a more sinister turn, as malformed mutants and formidable combat robots begin melting the flesh of innocent children, in a grotesque hybrid of Westworld and The Fly. It’s a mashup of all the things he enjoyed in his childhood, says the director, from trips to Universal Studios Japan to horror movies by Lucio Fulci, John Carpenter and Tobe Hooper, to the gory zombie violence of the Resident Evil video game. The amusement-park-gone-awry scenario is a perfect fit for the strange world of gekimation. “It’s like I’m making an attraction myself,” Ujicha says. “Using my own supplies, and my childhood experiences.” Ujicha is working on his third full-length gekimation feature (“It’s going to take another three or four years,” he says) but he is not planning to alter his working methods or his rich fantasy worlds. “I’ve left my parents’ home and moved into an even tinier place now,” he jokes. With the backing of major production house Yoshimoto Kogyo, Ujicha may well be on the verge of a mainstream breakthrough. “Gekimation has not been well known in Japan,” says Violence Voyager producer Kimitsugu Ueno. “But with Ujicha, it will only become more popular – and I’m really looking forward to seeing that.” • The Weird and Wonderful World of Ujicha is released on Blu-ray on 25 January.	929
“India is two countries in one,” our hero Balram observes in The White Tiger: there is an India of light, preserve of the rich and powerful; and an India of darkness, where millions toil in poverty. The White Tiger is a vivid study of caste and servility, as Balram (Adarsh Gourav) ingratiates his way into the service of a wealthy family, until he realises he is consigned to reside in the darkness. “And don’t believe for a second there’s a million-rupee gameshow you can win to get out of it,” he says, in a dig at that other fantasy of Indian class mobility, Slumdog Millionaire. There is rarely a magical mechanism by which people are lifted out of poverty, but the movies are often happy to peddle that notion. We would be kidding ourselves if we thought The White Tiger’s class/caste analysis only applied to India. Elsewhere, it is either better disguised or presented as a fact of life, especially when it comes to stories about servants. The Hollywood equivalent to Slumdog would be a Cinderella fantasy such as Maid in Manhattan, in which Jennifer Lopez’s lowly hotel cleaner is whisked into the light by senator Ralph Fiennes. Nor is there much difference between Balram and, say, PG Wodehouse’s Jeeves, or the dozens of other downstairs domestics in British period fare such as Gosford Park or even the recent Bridgerton. They might detest their overlords but they know their place – usually serving tea in the background. It doesn’t have to be this way. The White Tiger readily brings to mind The Servant, Joseph Losey and Harold Pinter’s subversive 1963 study of a sly manservant (Dirk Bogarde) who steadily takes over the Chelsea home of his upper-crust employer (James Fox). Similar tales abound in European cinema: Losey’s follow-up The Go-Between for one, or Diary of a Chambermaid – following a young woman’s ordeal at the hands of the haute bourgeoisie. Jean Renoir filmed it in 1946; Luis Buñuel turned in a more unsettling version in 1964; there was also a 2015 remake. France’s infamous Papin sisters – maids who murdered their mistress in 1933 – inspired a host of works including Jean Genet’s play The Maids (Glenda Jackson and Susannah York starred in the 1975 film), Sister My Sister, and Claude Chabrol’s terrific La Cérémonie, starring Sandrine Bonnaire and Isabelle Huppert. Then there is that masterclass in British servility The Remains of the Day, in which Anthony Hopkins’s terminally repressed butler rues a lifetime of loyalty to a Nazi-sympathising toff (Fox again). Many of these stories are conveniently set in the past, which makes The White Tiger a dangerous modern rarity, although last year’s Parasite struck a very similar chord. Let’s not pretend the gap between the haves and have-nots has narrowed. Maybe the movies have some catching up to do.	561
In the 90s, everyone had heard the urban myth about black-market organ trading: the story of the poor chump who went to a party and woke up in a bath of ice minus a kidney. Now, with this blackly funny, cheerfully violent bad-taste comedy-horror, director Brea Grant riffs on the legend. Her film is set in 1999 in the ER unit of an Arkansas hospital where one of the nurses, Mandy (Angela Bettis), runs a side hustle in organ trafficking. Whenever a patient who is unlikely to make it is wheeled in, she earmarks them for harvest – and has even been known to nudge victims along with an injection of bleach. Mandy arrives for the night shift dead exhausted. Patients assume that she is overworked, but the truth is that Mandy is addicted to opiates, slipping vials of morphine into her scrubs pocket. She bankrolls her habit with the organ business, working in cahoots with nursing colleague Karen (Nikea Gamby-Turner). Bettis is terrific, beautifully underplaying Mandy’s bone-dry sense of humour: she is openly contemptuous of patients and their families, rolls her eyes at colleagues and refreshingly has zero anxiety to please. And while she may bump off the odd patient, she is also highly competent. She is not, however, a criminal mastermind. Things go seriously wrong when Mandy recruits her cousin, textbook airhead blonde Regina (Chloe Farnworth), who botches a kidney pick-up. After misplacing the organ, Regina puts on a nurse’s uniform and decides to find another patient to kill. It’s a throwaway film that perhaps I shouldn’t have enjoyed as much as I did, but Mandy is such a deliciously sour character. • Available from 25 January on digital platforms.	331
Here’s a superbly acted, though worryingly polite, Holocaust survival drama by the Ukrainian film-maker Vadim Perelman. It’s the story of a Jewish man from Belgium called Gilles (Nahuel Pérez Biscayart), who stays alive in a transit camp by pretending to be half-Iranian and teaching Farsi to a savage-tempered SS officer, Klaus Koch (Lars Eidinger). In truth, Gilles doesn’t know a word of Farsi; the language he makes up is gibberish, and he lives in constant terror of slipping up, forgetting one of the words he’s invented – almost 600 in six months. The film opens with the line “inspired by true events”, but given the plausibility issues here surely it is safe to prefix that claim with “very loosely”. The setting is France, 1942; Gilles, the son of a rabbi, is transported to a transit camp with other Jews caught trying to flee to Switzerland. A hustler by nature, Gilles easily – too easily – persuades Nazi officer Koch that he speaks Farsi. Koch is a chef by training and dreams of opening a restaurant in Iran after the war. Suspecting Gilles of lying, he grills him, with laughably easy questions: “What is the capital of Persia?” “What language do they speak?” Persian Lessons is more credible as a psychological study – and, if a performance can rescue a film, it’s Biscayart’s portrayal of Gilles. With his gaunt face and perpetually stunned expression, he is the embodiment of Primo Levi’s man who knows no peace, who lives by a yes or no. But Perelman goes light on the audience. He refrains from depicting anything too harrowing – there’s nothing here too brutal or upsetting to make you look away from the screen. This fable about language and memory is a troublingly easy watch – though it floored me in the devastating final moments, unexpectedly acquiring great depth and seriousness of purpose. • Persian Lessons is on digital platforms from 22 January.	386
James D’Arcy is one of those good-looking, highly competent British actors who is steadily and widely employed, but seldom gets cast in the main role – apart from, say, playing Edward VIII in Madonna’s memorably panned biopic WE. This quirky, low-budget science-fiction feature gives him a chance to let rip (maybe just a smidge too much at times) as Adam Bird, a depressed middle manager for a technology firm. The American accents everyone puts on, even though most of the cast is British, suggests that events are supposed to be taking place somewhere in North America, though the cityscape, with its glowing monorail and CGI skyline, is pretty obviously a set – in this case a studio in Vilnius, Lithuania. That barely matters because the characters hardly ever go outside, and if they do it’s mainly at night because the sun is now so hot and toxic. Writer-director Guy Moshe has mashed together some solid and recently fashionable dystopian conceits, touching, for instance, on the existential dilemmas of cloning, or the lovelessness of always-online society. However, after a promising start featuring lushly brutalist production design – all concrete, 3D printed plastic and recessed lighting – the concepts start to feel like a less interesting Black Mirror episode, and the last act is a mess. But D’Arcy really goes hell for leather as his character starts to unravel: he faces betrayal from his wife (Anna Brewster), a Mephistophelian inventor (Delroy Lindo) and eventually his own facsimile. Jagged editing with explicatory flashbacks doesn’t make it any easier to parse, and the confinement to a single set for most of the second half evokes experimental fringe theatre, not necessarily in a good way. However, the scene where Adam shags a rubber sex doll will live on in the memory long after you’ve forgotten what the film was actually about. • LX 2048 is available on digital platforms from 25 January.	370
2002 was a bumper year for romcoms. Banking on the commercial safety of a saccharine love story, studios splashed out on everything from the Nick Hornby adaptation About A Boy to Gurinder Chadha’s Hounslow tale Bend It Like Beckham, Sandra Bullock facing off against corporate shill Hugh Grant in Two Weeks Notice, matrimonial romp My Big Fat Greek Wedding, and Reese Witherspoon’s nostalgic Sweet Home Alabama, to name just a few titles. This was a golden age for will-they-won’t-they tales set to the backdrop of the new millennium, burgeoning digital literacy and predictable scripts that ensured that they, in fact, always did. Nestled amongst these releases was a critically derided, commercially dominating cultural relic: Maid In Manhattan. The film stars Jennifer Lopez as a maid working in a luxury Manhattan hotel, who finds herself falling for a senatorial candidate (Ralph Fiennes) – who in turn has a soft spot for Richard Nixon – via a farcical case of mistaken identity. Lopez keeps up with her adopted, socialite guise until her secret is revealed and much hand-wringing ensues. Fiennes ultimately decides that her lowly status as a maid is good enough for him; he can share his wealth anyway. Over the closing credits we see that Fiennes has won his seat and Lopez has now transitioned from maid to an employer of maids. Lopez was at the height of her popularity and power when the film was released, having broken through with the title role in Selena in 1997, then played alongside George Clooney in Steven Soderbergh’s Out of Sight, before starring in hit The Wedding Planner with Matthew McConaughey, as well as reaching number one in the US charts with her second album J.Lo – a nickname coined by director Oliver Stone on the set of his 1997 film U Turn. Lopez’s money-making credentials were solid. Fiennes, meanwhile, brought an outsized theatrical gravitas to his role, following Oscar-nominated turns in Schindler’s List and The English Patient. From the lofty, hindsighted position of this century’s increasing political turmoil and structural inequality, their pairing in the film now becomes an excellent satire on new millennium naivety – an attempt to shoehorn fairytale tropes into an unruly and unbalanced modern society. In the film’s moral universe, the only place for women of colour is in the bowels of the hotel, performing menial work, and the only way one of the more ambitious of their ranks, Lopez, can progress is by mistakenly posing as a white socialite and ultimately romancing her way out of her social class. Above all, Fiennes is implicitly praised for his willingness to elevate her into his ranks, to be seen with someone like a brown maid in public. And in the film’s climactic scene, Lopez’s son argues that his mother should be given a second chance, making a clumsy comparison to rehabilitating Nixon after his impeachment in the process. If nothing else, we know by now that impeachment should not be so easily glossed over … Even the film’s poster is absurd. Lopez sits on a bench in front of the Manhattan skyline in her maid’s uniform – a visual signifier of her servitude – while she daydreams in an infantilised pose an image floating in the sky of her in a diamond necklace flanked by Fiennes, him showing more than a glimpse of his future turn as Voldemort through an unnerving smirk. With the hindsight, too, of Lopez’s scene-stealing turn in 2019’s Hustlers, here we see her acting chops in embryonic form, while the supporting cast props her up in impressive fashion. The late Bob Hoskins provides paternal authority as butler Lionel, Stanley Tucci is on reliably camp form as Fiennes’ adviser Jerry and the late Natasha Richardson is the gleefully villainous socialite Caroline Lane. All the while Fiennes holds court as the smiling, yet ominously ambitious senatorial candidate. In a year of popular romcoms that at least attempted to incorporate the nuances of reality – immigrant experiences in Bend It Like Beckham and My Big Fat Greek Wedding, depression in About A Boy, southern anachronism in Sweet Home Alabama – Maid in Manhattan stands out as a curious, absurdist fairytale. It deserves another watch because of its fantastic ignorance to the context of its making. It is the unexpected death knell of the romanticised American dream onscreen; it is the last gasp of old-fashioned romcom idealism in a different world. It tells us, in the most glowing of terms, that you can’t hope to work your way into a better life any more, that in fact the odds are so stacked against you if you are a single, working-class mother that all you can hope for is a chance, mistaken encounter to be swept off your feet. And then, you too can become a profiteering business owner, enacting the means of your own subjugation on those less fortunate. Happily ever after, indeed.

Name: A roll about and a curry. Appearance: Picture someone eating a curry and then engaging in sexual intercourse. Primary advocate: Danny Dyer. This whole thing already sounds like it was created with a random word generator. I assure you, it is all grounded in truth. So let me get this right, Danny Dyer is calling upon people to eat curries and have sex? Not people. Just one person. Oh good. Who? His daughter. Oh God. Why? I’ll contextualise. Danny Dyer’s daughter, Dani Dyer, is in her final trimester of pregnancy, and Danny Dyer is eager to help speed up the process. By urging her to eat curry and have sex? That’s correct. He advocated this on their podcast Danny and Dani: Sorted With the Dyers. Spicy food and penetrative sex are viewed as two of the most traditional methods that women use to induce labour. Really? Do they work? It’s inconclusive. Eating spicy food is said to stimulate your uterus into childbirth, but the parenting website BabyCentre points out that this is based on hearsay rather than evidence. And the other thing? Also inconclusive, despite the persistent myth that sperm can help to “ripen” the neck of your cervix, preparing your body for labour. This has put me right off my curry. I’m sorry. Danny Dyer is often right about many things, like when he accused Boris Johnson of “running around with his stupid haircut spouting bollocks”. However, in this instance he is probably isn’t right. So what can induce labour? Not a whole lot, in truth. The NHS website lists a number of options for expectant mothers to try, including hot baths, castor oil, enemas, acupuncture and homeopathy, but it is very careful to point out that none of these are supported by scientific evidence. So you cannot do it? You can. Around a fifth of all births are aided by induced labour. However, these utilise prostaglandin pessaries, which are administered by medical professionals at appointments that are made weeks in advance. And Dani Dyer hasn’t made an appointment? As far as anyone can tell, no. So she might as well just have a roll about and a curry? Sure, fine. Neither of those things will actively harm the baby, so theoretically Dani Dyer can have as many roll abouts and curries as she wants before her waters break. Do say: “Dani Dyer’s baby isn’t shifting.” Don’t say: “Has Danny tried swearing at it?”	504
There’s a real tragic power in this almost unbearably brutal and shocking movie from writer-director Jasmila Žbanić about the Srebrenica massacre in 1995 during the Bosnian war, in which more than 8,000 unarmed Bosnian Muslims sheltering in a so-called UN “safe area” were slaughtered: the biggest civilian atrocity in Europe since the second world war. Dutch UN peacekeeping soldiers in powder-blue helmets had been unable to stop Bosnian Serb forces swaggering into their compound – undisciplined, jacked up with the brutal thrill of conquest, paranoid about combatants supposedly hiding among the civilian refugees and simply seething with ethnic hate. Jasna Đuričić plays Aida, a schoolteacher-turned-translator who is employed by the UN to interpret in discussions between Bosnian Muslim leaders and UN officials, as Srebrenica falls to the Serb forces. Her husband Nihad (Izudin Bajrović) is a headteacher, and they sense that their military-age sons Hamdija (Boris Ler) and Sejo (Dino Bajrović) are now in great danger of reprisals from the victorious Serb army. As they huddle in the disused battery factory under the UN’s supposed protection with thousands of other terrified souls, and thousands more outside, with chaos, squalor and panic growing, Aida scurries around frantically trying to get information. She realises that the pathetic UN commander Karremans (Johan Heldenbergh) can do nothing in the face of the murderous bullies led by the notorious war criminal Ratko Mladić, played with horribly plausible conceit and disdain by Boris Isaković, smoothly and ambiguously announcing his determination not to hurt “innocent” people and handing out Toblerone bars to the trembling children. As an interpreter, Aida is effectively the drama’s liaison or intermediary between the different constituencies: with her licence to roam, she can take the audience to the Serbs, to the Dutch UN officers and to the civilians. The camera is often running behind Aida as she desperately goes around, demanding that the UN do something or at least protect her family. Đuričić’s face is agonisingly etched with her own horror and disbelief; she seems to age 20 years in the course of the drama. There is an extraordinary moment when, amid all the fear and boredom and cramped conditions, she sees two young people kissing and she starts laughing – overwhelmed, perhaps, at this evidence that life and humanity goes on, or perhaps at the glorious but vulnerable innocence of youth. Maybe the kissing couple think that everything will be all right, and a flashback gives us Aida’s own youth, taking part in a boozy “beauty contest” in a bar, in the days when Serbs, Muslims and Croats were still friends and neighbours. There are wrenching moments when Aida recognises former pupils of hers now in Serb uniform, pushing her around at gunpoint. A previous film of Žbanić’s, Esma’s Secret: Grbavica, with a similar Bosnian theme, won the Golden Bear in Berlin in 2006, though I was less convinced. But her latest film seemed to me an icily brilliant and overwhelmingly convincing attempt to tackle, head-on, this shameful atrocity: shameful for the UN, the European Union and all those western world leaders who had been reluctant to intervene – perhaps because the totemic word “Sarajevo” made them fear a new world war. Perhaps also in their hearts they thought military intervention was all very well in the Middle East but not in Europe. At any rate, the Srebrenica massacre arguably galvanised Nato forces against Mladic. As for the title, it’s taken from the apocryphal Christian tradition that Peter met the risen Christ outside Rome and asked him: “Quo vadis?” – “Whither goest thou?” – and the answer was: to Rome, to be crucified again. Aida herself is crucified twice, once during the massacre and again afterwards, as she begins to recognise certain people in the community she has rejoined. After 25 years, the time has come to look again at the horror of Srebrenica, and Zbanic has done this with clear-eyed compassion and candour. • Quo Vadis, Aida? is available on Curzon Home Cinema from 22 January.	772
Initial high hopes are dashed at the third-act stage of this disappointing cabin-in-the-woods horror-mystery in which actor Dave Franco (brother of James) makes his directorial debut, co-writing with mumblecore film-maker Joe Swanberg. Two couples rent an ocean-front beach house for a luxury weekend getaway: tech entrepreneur Charlie (Dan Stevens) and his partner Michelle (Alison Brie), with Charlie’s brother, Josh (Jeremy Allen White), and Josh’s partner, Mina (Sheila Vand), who is also the co-owner of Charlie’s tech startup. When the foursome arrives, they are instantly nettled by the guy showing them around the property: Taylor (Toby Huss) makes casually racist comments about Mina. And it turns out their ultra-fancy rental has some very strange things about it. Are they being spied on? The dynamic between the four characters is interesting at first, in part because there is already some difficult sexual and social tension between them; it isn’t just the weirdo place they find themselves in. But when the gory/scary stuff really starts happening, the film suddenly loses its dramatic charge. The focus is muddled and uncertain. When tough guy Josh (who we learn has already done jail time for violence) starts taking action against someone who might not actually have done anything wrong, the film starts becoming more of a suspense thriller in which our four hapless heroes have to cover up their own misdeeds. It almost seems as if they themselves are the bad guys, which undermines the potency and the dramatic point of the threat that emerges from the darkness. It’s pretty basic boilerplate, scary-movie stuff, with tropes and tricks that have already been extensively satirised elsewhere. • The Rental is available on Amazon Prime Video from 22 January.	333
Depressingly, this Danish psychological thriller resurrects some pretty outdated sexist stereotypes with a quartet of emotionally manipulative, unsisterly and two-timing female characters. It comes to us from a trio of men: director Jesper W Nielsen and a script by Christian Torpe, who adapts Christian Jungersen’s bestselling novel about four women working at a small NGO investigating genocide. When they begin to receive death threats, their suspicions turn on each other – and the film plays with the possibility that inside each of them may lurk a crazy psycho bitch. Danica Curcic plays Iben, an earnest researcher who was recently held hostage in Kenya by terrorists. Back in Copenhagen she is experiencing PTSD, at night seeing the child soldier who guarded her, a gentle, soulful-looking boy. Iben works at the NGO with her best friend Malene (Amanda Collin), a beautiful, complicated woman who shows cruel disregard for other people’s feelings. With the team administrator Camilla (Lene Maria Christensen) they snidely gang up on the new librarian Anne-Lise (Sidse Babett Knudsen). It’s Iben who gets the first threatening email. Everyone assumes the sender is a Serbian war criminal – but might it be Anne-Lise? There is nothing wrong with the performances. The best-friend dynamic of Iben and Malene feels nicely complex and plausible – which is more than can be said for the rest of the film. The two women have recently co-authored a book exploring the psychology of war criminals, and its thesis is that most people have something inside them ready to commit evil. And their pass-agg workplace bullying appears to be meant as a small-scale equivalent of that tendency, leading to some truly absurd plot twists as the characters turn on each other. Throughout the film I had the niggling feeling that at the bottom of it is a deep dislike of women – or, at the very least, a total lack of understanding. • The Exception is available on digital platforms from 22 January.	368
This animated Argentinian-Spanish co-production offers a pretty undistinguished tale of a zero-to-hero talking creature (a scrawny, bug-eyed hen named Turuleca, voiced by Elisabeth Gray) who joins the circus and becomes a star – though it’s fair to say that the character, lighting and set designs are often striking. Even so, most of the nice, more-central-to-the-plot characters are very bland, while Turuleca herself is an emphatically hideous creation. On the other hand, there’s a higher degree of craft to the villains and secondary cast members, with their gargoyle faces and stylised figures. The opening act, where our avian heroine is acquired by sweet little old retired music teacher Isabel (Roxanne Bachmann), seems to augur the usual hyper-idealised view of farm life. But when Isabel falls off a roof and has to go to hospital to recover from amnesia, things kick up a notch: Turuleca, on her way to find her mistress, falls in with a troupe of circus folk. The dancing, songs and assorted circus-y antics strike a nice balance between the fantastic possibilities of the cartoon form and enough verisimilitude to keep more literal-minded kids engaged. And it’s a nice touch that this very modern, ethical circus won’t use animal acts because animals can’t give their consent – a rule that’s cleverly circumvented here by having a sentient, talking chicken as its protagonist. The voice acting from the cast for this dubbed-into-US-accented English version is also serviceable if not particularly outstanding. At least the maladroit song translations from Spanish into English create hilariously inept lyrics that sometimes don’t even bother to rhyme. • The Wacky Hen is available on digital platforms from 25 January.	319
The Cannes film festival will be delayed from its customary May slot until July, it has been reported. According to Variety, the festival’s organisers will announce new dates for the 2021 edition this month, after last year’s event was called off following a series of postponements. According to the report, the organisers have confirmed their resolve to host a physical event in 2021, after the cancellation of Cannes in 2020 dealt a body blow to the international release circuit. If the festival does move from May, July appears the most likely timeslot: later in the year would precipitate a clash with major festivals such as Venice and Toronto, which normally take place in the last week of August or the first week in September; while space in Cannes in June is already taken by the Cannes Lions advertising festival, which is due to go ahead as planned. Variety suggests that the Cannes hotel organisation, the Syndicat des Hotels de Cannes et du Bassin Cannois, has been already told the festival will move to July – normally peak tourist season, but currently badly hit by the pandemic travel restrictions. A local hotelier is quoted as saying: “The dates we’ve agreed on are between July 5-25. So, the festival could start roughly around July 5, or a few days later.” According to an interview in French magazine Les Inrockuptibles, Cannes general delegate Thierry Fremaux has also raised the possibility of extending the festival’s length due to the likelihood of a backlog of high-quality films delayed by the pandemic. After the festival was called off in 2020, Fremaux presented a selection of over 50 films, including Wes Anderson’s as-yet-unreleased The French Dispatch, Pixar animation Soul, which premiered on streaming platform Disney+ in December, and Lovers Rock and Mangrove from Steve McQueen’s Small Axe anthology for the BBC.	348
Roger Corman’s 1964 movie The Masque of the Red Death is taken from Edgar Allan Poe’s eerie tale from the medieval mist, about a plague closing in on the castle of a cruel and wealthy sensualist. Disease is the implacable god. It’s a horribly appropriate moment for this film’s reappearance. This is an expressionist horror-ballet, extravagantly shot by cinematographer Nicolas Roeg, and for all its theatricality and Grand Guignol, there is really nothing absurd in it. In fact, Corman’s formal artistry and conviction on a limited budget look more impressive than ever, and with his iconic Poe adaptations he did more than anyone in academe to establish the author’s position in the literary canon. That disturbing red-clad figure, and the villain’s horror of the colour red, are surely a premonition of Roeg’s later masterpiece Don’t Look Now, and the mysterious cowled figure and final apocalyptic procession make it almost an indie-pulp American equivalent of Ingmar Bergman. Sonorous Vincent Price plays Prince Prospero, an Italian nobleman with the power of life and death over the poor villagers who are already terrorised by the “red death” pestilence, foretold or caused by a mysterious figure in a red cloak who sits in the bleak forest, his back against a gnarled tree, impassively dealing out tarot cards. On a vicious whim, Prospero orders a beautiful, pious peasant girl called Francesca (Jane Asher), together with her betrothed Gino (David Weston) and father Ludovico (Nigel Green), to be brought back to his castle, where he is preparing to host a magnificent masquerade ball for all his cringing courtier-sycophants, including the resentful Alfredo (Patrick Magee). To Francesca’s horror, Prospero reveals that he and his favoured mistress Juliana (Hazel Court) are satanists, and that this gruesome festival will be an orgy of indulgence climactically offered up to the evil one, in the very midst of poverty and sickness. In fact, screenwriters Charles Beaumont and R Wright Campbell drew on other Poe stories, including Hop-Frog, about a person with dwarfism employed as a jester and humiliated by the king. In this movie, Hop Toad (Skip Martin) is a dwarf jester who is required to perform a deeply strange dance for the assembled jeering aristocrats at Prospero’s hideous court with his love, Esmeralda (Verina Greenlaw) – and they are then abused and insulted. It really is one of the weirdest things about a captivatingly weird film. The colour scheme reveals itself like a Dulux sample chart from hell, as characters walk through rooms in Prospero’s castle that are each decorated in one colour – a very bad trip, like the ending of 2001. The “yellow” room, we learn, was used as a sadistic prison by Prospero’s father for one of his enemies and, on his release, the man could not bear to look at the sun. The entire film, in fact, seems to take place at night, or in that artificial day-for-night twilight I associate with Hammer vampire movies. The Masque of the Red Death moves with a sinuous, unselfconscious elegance. • The Masque of the Red Death is released on digital platforms, Blu-ray and DVD on 25 January.	618
Cult Japanese filmmaker Yoshihiro Nishimura, who started off doing special effects before moving into the director’s chair, is best known for pulpy, action-horror fare with self-explanatory titles such as Mutant Girls Squad and Tokyo Gore Police, as well as the more enigmatically monikered Meatball Machine Kodoku. Tokyo Dragon Chef, I’m assuming, lies tonally between the one about gore police and the one about meatball machines given it’s about a pair of ageing yakuza thugs, Ryu (Yasukaze Motomiya) and Tatsu (Yoshiyuki Yamaguchi), who decide to open a ramen restaurant. Their speciality, which does indeed look darn tasty, is a recipe Tatsu honed while doing time and working in the prison’s mess hall, a kind of ma po tofu with ramen. Soon, their tiny venue is drawing rave reviews from YouTubers and a pretty schoolgirl (played by pop star Rinne Yoshida) comes round to sing songs about ramen because – of course – this is also a musical. But then another pair of rival ex-yakuza types (the joke is that all four actors used to play gangsters in straighter films back in the day) start up a food truck business selling ramen across the street. What’s more, they’ve hired a buxom, pink-haired creature in a latex bodysuit (Saiko Yatsuhashi) who may not actually be human and somehow never feels the strain of the enormous quantities of food she can eat. The Japanese dialogue is probably much funnier than the subtitles make it seem, but it’s hard not to suspect that even native speakers might find the film’s concept more amusing than its execution. You have probably seen TikTok videos with more budget than this film. But it’s playful and brisk, and what’s not to love about any movie that has baddies who go around with giant eyeball masks on their heads, just like the immortal experimental punk band the Residents? • Tokyo Dragon Chef is available on digital platforms from 25 January.	377
Director Glendyn Ivin’s melodrama Penguin Bloom comprises two key plot strands – one involving a human and the other an animal – which have unsubtle intersecting metaphors. While vacationing in Thailand, Sam Bloom (Naomi Watts) falls off a ledge and becomes a paraplegic. Months after the accident, while she is in the throes of deep depression, her husband Cameron (Andrew Lincoln) and their three young boys (Griffin Murray-Johnston, Felix Cameron and Abe Clifford-Barr) bring into the family home an injured magpie they name Penguin, pledging to nurse it back to health. And so: a bird learning to fly again coupled with the story of a wheelchair user whose spirits are broken. Insulating Penguin Bloom a little from complaints that it trades in heavy-handed metaphors is the fact it was based on a true story (adapted from a book by Cameron Bloom and Bradley Trevor Greive). It reminded me of Craig Monahan’s gentle 2014 drama Healing, which was inspired by a real-life initiative that had prisoners working in a sanctuary for injured raptors – thus ripe with symbolism invoking broken wings and broken people. The idea of an animal’s physical and behavioural transformation mirroring a person’s is an interesting and multifaceted concept. Are we for instance projecting ourselves on to animals when we see our stories in them, or are some narrative templates – such as triumphing over adversity – so strong they transcend species, bringing a degree of narrative order to a chaotic universe? It becomes painfully clear early in Penguin Bloom, however, that Ivin – who recently directed two exceptional TV series, The Cry and Safe Harbour – is going to take the easy way out. Even talented directors find it difficult to resist the lure of the voiceover, despite that famous dictum being drilled into their heads since film school: the one about how they ought to “show, don’t tell”. The person doing the telling in Penguin Bloom is Noah (Murray-Johnston), one of Sam and Cameron’s sons, who begins by reminiscing that “Mum loves the ocean, she always has” and eventually concludes that she “is not the person she once was ... but for me, she’s more than that”. How was anybody not wincing when that line was recorded? I quickly found myself longing for less yakety-yak and more visual storytelling – only for another dictum, “careful what you wish for,” to start ringing in my head. In one dramatic scene Sam stares at a jar of honey and pushes it off the kitchen bench, as if to say: my life has been smashed to pieces – a moment so symbolically loaded they put it on the trailer. During another Sam smashes framed family photos with a broomstick, and yes – they put that one on the trailer too. Meanwhile, Penguin stays busy charming the characters and the audience, softening Sam’s hardened heart and embedding herself into the family’s routines – pottering around the home, stealing a teabag from a mug and generally behaving like a loveable little scamp. The way the bird (several were used during production) is integrated into various scenes – as if it really were a member of the family – is exceptionally well done: props to magpie trainer Paul Mander, who was assisted with modestly used and seamlessly integrated CGI. When Penguin finds herself in a traumatic situation, I discovered myself more emotionally involved than I thought, genuinely concerned for her safety – well aware that Australian cinema has a reputation for killing off animals (particularly dogs: Mad Max 2, Red Dog, Snowtown, I’m looking at you). I felt more invested in Sam’s journey in the second half too, when she takes up kayaking and Watts’ strong, solemn performance is afforded more space to breathe. But every once in a while Ivin did something to make me question his motives. Take for example a shot late in the piece, in which Sam looks ahead and imagines herself – smiling, upright and walking happily – beaming back at her. This image comes dangerously close to endorsing outdated and offensive views of disability: particularly the idea that a person isn’t “complete” unless they look and move like the majority. By this point shouldn’t the film be more interested in the person Sam has become, rather than who she once was? A postscript informs us that Bloom went on to achieve numerous sporting distinctions, as if this were nothing more than a small thing to bung on at the end. It is a final confirmation that Penguin Bloom, while heartening, is more about loss than rebirth. There is a great, moving story to tell about the real Sam Bloom – but this film only gets part of the way there. • Penguin Bloom is in Australian cinemas now	914
This two-hander from writer-director Sam Levinson starring John David Washington and Zendaya can be shouty, hammy and shrill, with handbrake-turn theatrical mood shifts. At its worst, it feels like an insufferable vanity project. But it’s pugnaciously well-acted, flavoured with vinegary insights and rage-filled denunciations, and a hilarious set piece of scorn about how awful film critics are. Malcolm (Washington) is a conceited young movie director and Marie (Zendaya) his smart, gorgeous girlfriend, returning to the fancy house rented for them by the production company after the gloriously successful premiere of his first feature. Malcolm pours himself one out in their luxury kitchen, puts James Brown on the sound system and is keen to indulge a new, private afterparty mood of angry triumph and self-congratulation that he couldn’t really show the other guests earlier. But Marie is simmering with discontent due to his failure to thank her in his gushing post-screening speech. She is deeply hurt by his failure to acknowledge that his movie is surely inspired by her own desperately unhappy life. Their subsequent ferocious row takes in sex, relationships, celebrity, the movies, the artist’s burden and what they both face as people of colour. Malcolm &amp; Marie is one of the first substantial feature films to have been made under Covid-compliant conditions, a project embarked on when Levinson’s HBO TV show Euphoria starring Zendaya had to be paused. Lockdown has enforced a new intimacy on us all, and intimacy is to some degree what this movie is about, although its formality and theatricality often rather precludes this. There’s a fair bit of shouting and actor-speechifying in the film. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t, although without this rhetorical mannerism Zendaya would not have been able to pull off a brilliant I’ll-have-what-she’s-having moment of deception near the end. The film can be self-conscious, even humourless. But there is a great scene when the first review comes through on Malcolm’s phone and he convulses with nerves. It is written by someone he derisively calls the “white girl from the LA Times” who had praised him at the party earlier, and he screams with rage when he realises he has to get through the paywall and scrambles for his credit card. Washington is very funny as he shows us how Malcolm is incandescent with rage at every single aspect of this review: even by the fact that it is a very good review. The critic calls his film a “masterwork” but Malcolm is infuriated by her ignorance of the technical aspects of cinema, that she calls a dolly shot a “Steadicam” and clearly has no idea about lenses. He is also incensed by her deployment of differing comments on sexual and racial politics. She praises his debunking of the “white saviour” myth – though Malcolm is certain that if he was white she would be accusing the same scene of endorsing this myth – and turns the tables on him as a man by accusing him of revelling in and sexualising a woman’s trauma. Malcolm is almost delirious with indignation at the idea that her praise for him entitles her to this supercilious identity-politics point-scoring. This scene is amusing, uncomfortable and educational for those of us in the white film-critic community, made only more intriguing by being clearly such a heartfelt personal moment from Levinson, part of the white writer-director community (and son of the renowned Barry Levinson, who is thanked in the closing credits). Malcolm and Marie argue about authenticity, and how this supposedly great virtue is demanded, or paraded, by those who do not have real knowledge or expertise, but still think their fuzzy and “real” emotions are what count. It is a shrewd point, and whether or not the film review scene is the most authentic thing about the film, it is part of a smart, fiercely performed movie. • Malcolm &amp; Marie is released on Netflix on 5 February.	748
It almost comes as a shock, in the era of Disney+ and multitudes of superheroes finding their way to the mouse house’s streaming Shangri-La, to recall that shows such as WandaVision and the forthcoming Loki will not be the first occasions we have seen Marvel’s costumed crimefighters on the small screen. Once upon a time it was ABC’s Agents of Shield and a quintet of New York-set Netflix shows, Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Iron Fist and The Punisher, that were getting the headlines. The former was recently cancelled after seven seasons, while the Netflix shows wound up in 2018 after a middling crossover event titled The Defenders. Despite occasional weaknesses – Iron Fist almost singlehandedly revived the painfully outdated “white saviour” motif, while Luke Cage and The Punisher struggled to retain interest after bravura openings – there was much to like about this slightly more rugged and grownup take on the Marvel universe. The problems faced by Matt Murdock, Cage and Jones on the streets of Manhattan were generally more down to earth than those of their big-screen counterparts: corrupt criminals or kung fu kicking gangs rather than alien invasion or maniacal super-robots. This made more sense for the modest budgets Marvel Television had to work with: it’s a lot cheaper to choreograph endless martial arts battles in New York warehouses than it is to depict costumed titans fighting off the latest interdimensional interloper, or flitting off to other worlds. (Interestingly, this is a problem Disney+ is already starting to experience: early episodes of WandaVision already suggest the show will take a less ambitious approach than we have been used to when watching Scarlet Witch and Vision in the multiplexes.) And yet if Marvel is already so keen to grab the best heroes and villains from another studio’s Spider-Man movies (Sony’s Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield-led films), there ought to be a place for the choice characters from the Netflix shows to join the MCU? Rumours this week suggest this might just be happening: Charlie Cox, AKA Matt Murdock/Daredevil, has apparently been seen on the set of the forthcoming third Tom Holland Spider-Man flick, setting off a wave of speculation about whether New York’s blind lawyer turned crimefighter might be returning. Daredevil was always the most likely “street-level” superhero to make the leap to more illustrious territory: Cox was a classy heavyweight in the role and the series was probably the best of the Netflix shows (with the possible exception of Jessica Jones’s superb first season). Moreover, Daredevil isn’t a minor player in the comics – for many British fans, his adventures were the first Marvel stories we came across in the 1980s – alongside such lost classics as Captain Britain – and he regularly interacts with Tony Stark et al in mainstream American print titles. Had it not been for the abject failure of the Ben Affleck-led Daredevil movie in 2003, the superhero would likely have already made an appearance in the Avengers films. Murdock’s arrival in Spider-Man 3 also makes sense because the webslinger is the Marvel superhero who is the most everyday, the most mundane: dealing with being an ordinary New York teenager. Murdock is also used to providing succour for those in need via his courtroom skills, though you wonder quite how he’s going to help Parker survive being publicly outed as Spider-Man by Jake Gyllenhaal’s mock Mysterio in Far From Home. If Murdock does appear, the odds are on his appearance being a virtual cameo. The next Spider-Man movie is heavily rumoured to deal with the multiverse, with the possible appearance of Maguire and Garfield as alternate versions of the wisecracking wall crawler, a la the Oscar-winning animated smash Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse. Daredevil isn’t going to be the go-to guy to help Parker navigate such head-spinning, far-out territory, so we can probably assume he’ll make a fleeting appearance. Even so, Murdock’s debut would be a nice nod to those of us who stuck with the Netflix shows through all their ups and downs. And Daredevil belongs in this hallowed company. Perhaps there might be a place in the MCU for Jones, Cage and Iron Fist too, at some stage. The return of Vincent D’Onofrio as Kingpin would be very welcome, especially after the oversized supervillain lit up Sony’s Into the Spider-verse. Of course, we really do have to draw the line somewhere. Just don’t – please – go crazy and bring back Colin Farrell’s godawful Bullseye, OK Marvel? Despite the studio’s current apparent willingness to rehabilitate and revive pretty much every supervillain under the sun, no matter where they started out, there remain some older adaptations that really are best left forgotten.	894
The movie business is a gamble at the best of times. And in the immortal words of Kenny Rogers, you’ve got to know when to hold ‘em and when to fold ‘em. Timing is all. The stakes are rising. So are the vaccination figures. Is Covid about to throw in its hand? And as they hunch in a circle round the poker table, studio chiefs are wondering: do we hold on to these prestigious, expensive, effects-laden, star-stuffed movie properties of ours, waiting for cinemas to reopen, but risking an unprofitable pile-up with other delayed releases? Or do we fold – dump them on streaming services, abandon the supposed theatrical-release profits and move on? Disney folded with its movies Mulan and Soul and was quite happy to release them on the streaming platform. But now there’s a shift towards holding, studios sticking toughly with the cinema release model, and so there is a rash of further delays. It’s like looking up at a departures noticeboard in the 1970s era of British Rail. Edgar Wright’s Last Night In Soho, Jason Reitman’s Ghostbusters: Afterlife, Kay Cannon’s Cinderella are all now delayed, along with the Jared Leto superhero film Morbius and the video-game adaptation Uncharted. And most outrageously of all, that James Bond film – its cast now probably first in line for the Pfizer jab – with the now hilariously appropriate title No Time to Die. It has been put back for the umpteenth time. This is a movie whose delays are now famed part of Britain’s lockdown story, like clapping for carers and Chris Whitty calling for the next slide. No Time to Die now exists purely for film critics to make facetious remarks on Twitter. Here is the paradox. Because the end is in sight, we don’t get the movies, we get delays. People are now daring to believe that the Covid era’s days are numbered, so they should hold their nerve with a financial model that has stood up for decades. This year’s awards season is effectively over, in any case, and production has been slowed almost to a standstill, so why not hold back with the stockpile? For movie-lovers it’s infuriating. And the endless delays have revealed to me something more about what we have lost in this lockdown. Of course we have lost out on the thrill of being in the cinema, in the darkness: laughing, gasping and screaming in real time along with everyone else, responding to the epic scale of the screen. But we’re also losing out on the framing events of cinema, the social platforms that elevated it and made it special. Even if you don’t go to see films, you’re supposed to hear about them when they’re premiered at glitzy festivals and then released in cinemas. You’re supposed to read interviews with their stars and directors, consume all the exciting debates and the rows. And you’re supposed to know they’re out there, up there atop pop culture’s Mount Olympus – a special going-out treat that you can decide whether or not to have. When they are put out on streaming services, as part of the slosh of content pumped out on Netflix and Amazon Prime, well, the specialness is gone. The thrill is gone. It’s like booking to see an exhibition at Tate Modern and being told it’s cancelled but you can access high-resolution images on your laptop instead. So the delays are, oddly, an encouraging sign that the movie studios aren’t giving up. In the meantime, we just have to dream of better times and bigger screens to come.	711
Secret Cinema has defended proposals for an immersive Dirty Dancing event in east London, saying it will invest in local businesses after residents claimed it would be “hijacking” vital green space this summer. The company, one of the biggest cinema experience brands in the world, was given a licence by Waltham Forest council to use Low Hall sports ground in Walthamstow for three months, despite more than 100 complaints. Residents and campaigners say the event, which could run from mid-July to mid-September and is billed as a mix of “steamy dancing and dangerously catchy songs”, will bring noise pollution, a risk of Covid-19 transmissions and stop locals from using the playing fields for most of the summer. At a meeting, residents said the event would make the sports ground unusable for local children, while others complained about the show leaving “no positive legacy” and described it as “hijacking and damaging public land”. The Secret Cinema chief executive, Max Alexander, said the company always engaged with local communities, and planned to give 1,500 free tickets to residents and invite local schools to use the site in the daytime. Alexander admitted that for residents who were uninterested in the event it would be “a bit of a pain”, but said the company would work “to mitigate that pain”. “We put places on the map and then other businesses come in our wake,” he said. “We are itinerant but we leave a positive legacy with the people we engage with.” In 2019, the company’s Stranger Things attracted 100,000 visitors during its six-week run, and residents fear that influx of people during the summer could expose locals to potential transmissions of Covid-19. Sarah Eastwood, a healthcare worker and community member, said residents were scared about the prospect of thousands of visitors potentially spreading the virus before widespread vaccinations had reached some in the community. “It’s our mental and physical health and we have not been given a choice,” she said. “If we get a handful of workshops and some people get insecure security work, that’s nothing compared to what we lose.” The company made its name by mostly using brownfield sites as venues for immersive cinema experiences that have included interpretations of Star Wars, The Shawshank Redemption and Blade Runner. But residents say the use of a playing field, which has been a vital resource during the pandemic, would have a huge effect on their physical and mental wellbeing. John Mannion of Coppermill Swifts FC, a veterans’ football team that uses the field, said: “The amount of people who have used this area during lockdown has shot up, there are so many more people using that green space.” Other residents raised concerns about the fact nature reserves are a few hundred metres from the event’s boundary, and that the cost of tickets – which start at £45 – would price out many locals. Secret Cinema said they would use only half of the space and claimed it had created jobs for hundreds of local people in recent years. The company said the skills people learn from working on site could help them start careers, and Alexander said there were plans to provide football coaching for locals as well as work experience placements, although these were only in the planning stage. Waltham Forest council told the Guardian Secret Cinema still needed to get planning approval for the event and it would consider all responses to the application, with the event being subject to any Covid-19 restrictions and government guidance.	662
Clue Most films would rather audiences remain unaware that a different ending was ever shot, although they often can be found as DVD extras or, as is the case for many on this list, on YouTube. Campy whodunnit Clue embraced the chaos: its 1985 cinema release randomly featured one of three different denouements to encourage repeat business. (The streaming version just daisy-chains them together with the help of some witty title cards.) Amazon Prime Video To Live and Die in LA William Friedkin’s bracingly bleak 1985 noir – starring a pre-CSI William Petersen – is a neon-lit fever dream. Nervous executives insisted Friedkin shoot a bizarre alternate ending in which its two maverick agents were exiled to an Alaskan outpost, despite one of them being indisputably shotgunned in the face. Farcical but fun. Available on DVD Scott Pilgrim Vs the World When adapting a six-part graphic novel series about the wayward love life of a gaming-obsessed slacker, director Edgar Wright had some leeway with the ending (mostly because during production the final volume had not yet been published). The alternate finale sees Scott reconcile with his very young ex, Knives Chau, whom he treated pretty shabbily throughout, rather than his dream girl Ramona. Netflix The Butterfly Effect Ashton Kutcher is a traumatised time-traveller in this 2004 head-wrecker, revisiting major decisions in his life to try and make things turn out better. It says something about the grim tenor of the film that among its multiple alternate endings, the one where Kutcher zaps back to the womb and strangles himself with his umbilical cord is the most effective. Amazon Prime Video Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story This fun but shaggy send-up of sport film cliches originally saw doughy deadbeat Vince Vaughn get trounced by Ben Stiller’s team of corporate hardbodies in the climactic showdown. With slow-motion celebrations for the villains and a rousing orchestral swell, it is a total hoot. Now TV Die Hard With a Vengeance The third Die Hard swapped out the usual Christmas setting for a summer showdown on John McClane’s home turf of NYC. The rather dull climax had our hero gatecrash the getaway of bomber Jeremy Irons. A gnarlier alternative sees McClane playing Russian roulette with a rocket launcher. Now TV Little Shop of Horrors The original off-Broadway musical had a Twilight Zone-style conclusion where carnivorous plants conquered the world. Producers reportedly splashed out $5m to recreate that epic climax for the 1986 movie only for early test audiences to comprehensively reject it. The sequence was restored on the 2012 Blu-ray and is now a selling point. Digital platforms (£) Terminator 2: Judgment Day James Cameron notoriously shot a laughable alternate ending for Titanic and, even in his killer robot days, was up to the same tricks: witness the T2 cut where Linda Hamilton in grandma makeup reflects that “Michael Jackson turned 40”, so Judgment Day has been averted. It is … well, it’s bad. But it could have slammed the door on those endless sequels. Digital platforms (£) Fatal Attraction The Watership Down of erotic 1980s thrillers originally had a very different outcome: jilted lover Glenn Close kills herself but successfully frames horndog Michael Douglas for her murder. However, test audiences seemed keener for Douglas to return to his family, so despite Close’s vehement objections, the status quo was restored. Now TV I Am Legend A virulent pandemic decimates the world? Enough with your sci-fi nonsense! This eerie 2007 blockbuster sees last man standing Will Smith roaming a NYC riddled with zombies. The cinema ending had Smith sacrificing himself to save some survivors; in a retooled version his Shrek-loving prepper lives. Unusually, both are now officially available. Digital platforms (£, both versions)	694
The most famous (or infamous) sequence in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice comes along just after Batman has bashed Superman over the head with a washbasin. Weakened by Kryptonite gas grenades, the Man of Steel (Henry Cavill) gasps that Lex Luthor has kidnapped his mother, Martha. “Why did you say that name,” roars the Caped Crusader (Ben Affleck). His own mother, you see, was called Martha, too. I remember, on seeing the film, being almost as staggered as Batman was. I’d been a superhero geek for decades, but I’d never noticed that the mothers of DC Comics’ two most iconic characters had the same name. And yet Zack Snyder, the director of Batman v Superman, or one of the writers, Chris Terrio and David S Goyer, hadn’t just spotted the coincidence, they had imagined the impact it might have on the characters in question, given that Batman’s parents were murdered when he was a boy, and that Superman was adopted by Martha Kent after his own biological parents were vaporised in a planetary cataclysm. As different as the two superheroes were, Batman v Superman showed that they were linked by the trauma of their parents’ horrific deaths. Genius! This is a film, I thought, that my fellow nerds were going to adore. I wasn’t entirely correct. Most critics slated Batman v Superman as a miserable mess with a headache-inducing score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL, and a colour palette so dingy that it looked as if Superman had washed his blue and red jumpsuit along with his black jeans. Even viewers with a high tolerance for masks and capes were unimpressed. All too soon, Snyder’s film became a symbol of the way that Warner was mishandling DC’s superheroes, as opposed to the way that Disney was handling Marvel’s. And nothing about it was as derided as the Martha scene. Well, OK. I admit that the dialogue could have been more elegant. Maybe the characters shouldn’t have kept referring to Superman’s adoptive mother by her Christian name. But I maintain that the Martha idea was a clever one, and it’s connected to the key theme which makes me love Batman v Superman while so many people loathe it. Snyder dared to take two of the most popular, commercially viable superheroes ever created, and to say that they were both screwed-up mummy’s boys. Marvel’s cinematic universe, in contrast, is stocked with well-adjusted, quip-swapping paragons. Even the Batman played by Christian Bale was a clubbable fellow. But Snyder gave some serious thought to the question of what our favourite costumed crime-fighters might be like if they actually existed, and he concluded, not unreasonably, that a near-omnipotent extraterrestrial and an orphaned, billionaire vigilante might have deep-rooted psychological issues. Inspired by Frank Miller’s game-changing 1986 graphic novel, The Dark Knight Returns, Snyder decided that Batman and Superman would be insecure, angry, guilt-ridden, nightmare-haunted – and despised by a fearful populace. Somehow, he got away with making a multimillion-dollar blockbuster on that very subject. Yes, it’s hectic, dystopian and apparently lit by a low-watt torch bulb. Yes, it has an over-inflated sense of its own importance. But that’s how its two paranoid frenemies see the world. Affleck’s Batman is a sadistic loner who – thanks to the star’s imposing size and well-publicised personal demons – could plausibly beat up a roomful of Russian gangsters. This was the brutal bruiser that we Dark Knight Returns devotees had been waiting for. Cavill’s perma-frowning Superman, meanwhile, isn’t the gentle charmer that Christopher Reeve’s was. Snyder prefers to depict him as a living missile, sonic booming through the sky, or else as a divine messenger, floating down from on high for a brief, contemptuous word with us earthbound mortals. Since Batman v Superman was released, a television series (The Boys) and a film (Brightburn) have both played with the notion that an indestructible, unaccountable Superman-type might be a terrifying existential threat. But Snyder’s uncompromisingly subversive epic did so with Superman himself. In a startling early sequence, the director recaps the climactic fight between Superman and General Zod from 2013’s Man Of Steel, but this time we see it from ground level. We see the shattering skyscrapers, the choking dust clouds, the innocent civilians who are killed and maimed. In short, we see the mass destruction which tends to be glossed over in Marvel’s blockbusters. I understand why this doom and gloom might have been off-putting, but it was supposed to be. Batman v Superman isn’t a superhero movie, but an anti-superhero movie: a film about two people only a mother could love. Batman v Superman is available on HBO Max in the US and on Now TV in the UK	944
Powered by a surging, impatient energy and a bracing undercurrent of spite, Ramin Bahrani’s version of Aravind Adiga’s 2008 Booker prize-winning novel is one of the more successful literary adaptations of recent years. The story of a poor but wily driver who claws his way out of the cage created by caste and servitude to become a success story in the new India, it’s not subtle in approach. Nor should it be: it’s a full-blooded assault on a rigged system designed to keep the privileged in their lofty place and the poor on the streets far below. Although it leans heavily on narration, the film’s skittish cinematography brings texture to the backdrop and a satisfying depth to the characters. The narrator is Balram (Adarsh Gourav, excellent in a slippery, hard-to-like role); he’s smart and ambitious, but destined to work on his family’s tea stand. Spotting an opportunity, he learns to drive, masters the flattery that the upper classes expect from their servants, and inveigles himself into a driving job for Ashok (Rajkummar Rao). Balram brings total loyalty to his urbane, US-educated new boss. But loyalty cuts both ways. When Balram is betrayed by his employers, his ingratiating smile curdles, and generations-worth of suppressed anger finally erupts. In contrast to the empathic embrace of Bahrani’s early films (Man Push Cart; Chop Shop), this is harder, more cynical. But we don’t need to warm to the characters to be enthralled by this compulsively watchable class parable. On Netflix	299
A chirpy, good-natured pregnancy comedy from New Zealand, Baby Done is carried by a no-nonsense performance from standup comedian Rose Matafeo. She plays Zoe, a professional tree surgeon who is completely unprepared for her unplanned pregnancy. While her partner, Tim (Harry Potter alumnus Matthew Lewis), embraces the idea of parenthood, Zoe frets over the unfinished adventures on her to-do list. Tinder-dry delivery bolsters the film’s gentle humour, and while the momentum sags a little in the second half, the natural chemistry between Matafeo and Lewis keeps the audience invested and the story relatable.

Winter 2020 in Wuhan, China: ground zero for the coronavirus epidemic. This urgent fly-on-the-wall documentary, shot in four hospitals during the 76 days of lockdown in Wuhan, shows the “fearless soldiers”, as one grateful patient describes the doctors and nurses, on the frontline of a battle with a then unknown foe. It is, at times, harrowing. The film doesn’t shy away from grief at its rawest, fear at its most paralysing. There are moments – the swollen fingers of an elderly patient clinging to the hand of a stranger invisible behind layers of PPE – that are wrenchingly sad. But crucially, there’s also an element of hope and even humour in this affecting tribute to healthcare workers everywhere. On Dogwoof on Demand and other digital platforms	148
The submission by Bosnia-Herzogovina for this year’s international feature Oscar is a slow-burn drama with a palpable sense of growing dread, set during the Srebrenica massacre of 1995. More than 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were murdered by units under the command of General Ratko Mladić, now facing a life sentence having been convicted of crimes against humanity. Yet if that makes Quo Vadis, Aida? sound like an unbearably tough prospect, be reassured that in the hands of writer-director Jasmila Žbanić, who won a Berlin Golden Bear for her 2006 debut feature, Grbavica, this horrifying tale is lent a profoundly human heart, ensuring that we keep on watching, a notable achievement for a movie that is centrally concerned with the spectre of looking away. Jasna Đuričić, feted for her role in 2010’s White, White World, is utterly convincing as Aida, a translator working at a UN base near Srebrenica, who sees first hand the failure of peacemakers to prevent an unfolding catastrophe. “Will anyone in the world witness this tragedy, this unprecedented crime?” pleads a voice on a radio. Yet it’s clear that, despite being an alleged “safe zone”, nobody is ready or willing to protect this area. Instead, thousands are forced to flee to the UN encampment, where the Dutch authorities promptly close the gates on thousands more. Having struggled to get her husband and sons in under the wire – an early indication of future conflicts of interest – Aida is forced to maintain an outward appearance of calm as Mladić (played with an air of reptilian contempt by Boris Isaković) engages in a grotesque pantomime of “negotiations”, commanding a camera crew to record his actions as he promises “the safety of all innocent people”. Meanwhile, his forces enter the camp, handing out bread and chocolate in a chilling scene to which Žbanić lends quietly apocalyptic undertones. From the biblical allusions of the title to a scene in which Aida climbs up to survey the lost tide of humanity before her, our anguished heroine is cast in a role that evokes both the wilderness of exile and the burden of tortured responsibility. Time and again, cinematographer Christine A Maier’s cameras capture her rushing through the labyrinth of the camp, frantically attempting to save her own family (the tension is amplified by Jarosław Kamiński’s taut editing) while simultaneously dealing with the wider disaster that she cannot prevent. Meanwhile, flashbacks to a party in happier times sit alongside present encounters with former neighbours turned tormentors, lending pointed emotional weight to unfathomable horrors. There’s a hint of Terry George’s Hotel Rwanda in the understated evocation of an approaching atrocity, the sense of something terrible playing out in full view of a world that does nothing. Both films manage to balance the enormity of dreadful historical events with the emotional specificity of individual stories, allowing the audience to engage even as they are appalled and outraged. Inspired by the book Under the UN Flag: The International Community and the Srebrenica Genocide by Hasan Nuhanović, Žbanić crucially describes her film as portraying the “courage, love and resilience” of “a woman caught in a male game of war”, and dedicates it to “the women of Srebrenica and their 8,372 killed sons, fathers, husbands, brothers, cousins, neighbours…” “Now you will see the real film,” says a soldier just before one discreetly devastating sequence from which the camera slowly withdraws. Yet like the unblinking closeup that concludes the deeply moving (and ultimately redemptive?) epilogue to Quo Vadis, Aida?, Žbanić’s powerful and personal film keeps its eyes wide open.

Within the first 15 or so minutes of Apple TV+’s Palmer, something clicks in, a feeling of overwhelming familiarity, an inner voice quietly realising, “Ohhh, it’s that movie.” In this particular instance, that movie being the one about the ex-con who must make good with the help of a cute kid, a sturdy tale oft-told. It’s not that reheating leftovers can’t make for a filling meal but when done with such low energy and with such a low-wattage central performance, it’s hard to see the point. Why not, errrr, tell a new story instead? To give screenwriter Cheryl Guerriero some credit, there is a slight tweak to the formula and it’s one that gives Palmer its most, arguably only, vaguely interesting moments. While the titular character, played by Justin Timberlake, is every frosty movie ex-con with an easily flipped frown you can think of, the kid who melts him is a gender non-conforming boy who lives in the trailer next door, an intriguingly untold dynamic but one that promises far more than is delivered. Palmer, straight out of jail for a violent crime and straight into the house of his grandmother, played by June Squibb, is eager to restart his life. But the town he’s come back to isn’t quite so ready, and Palmer’s good intentions quickly fade away. In between bouts of drinking and shagging, he strikes up an unlikely friendship with Sam, played by newcomer Ryder Allen, an eight-year-old boy whose choice of dolls over cars has him painted as an outcast both at school and at home. When Sam’s mother, played by Juno Temple, runs off with her violent boyfriend, Palmer is suddenly left in charge of him while also juggling a burgeoning romance with his teacher, played by Alisha Wainwright. In the hands of actor-director Fisher Stevens (whose work behind the camera has tended to be non-fiction), Palmer plays like a fourth-rate Oscar bid from the early aughts, all washed-out cinematography and guitar pluck score, the kind of film that would have aimed to break big at Sundance with critics calling its lead performance “revelatory”. Perhaps in another universe with a better script and a different star, that might have been the case. But instead, Palmer is more of an “I’ve seen everything else, so sure” kinda plane movie, sort of competent enough but never reaching any of the high highs and low lows a drama such as this requires. The story is one we can predict, almost down to every last beat, which again wouldn’t necessarily be a major problem if it was told with a bit more fire, but it’s all so low-key, so third gear, that it’s frustratingly hard to feel even the slightest of emotion. Where the film does briefly come almost alive is in its positioning of Sam, a boy who’s more comfortable playing with toys traditionally intended for girls and, when allowed, dressing that way too. Even if Guerriero can’t quite figure out the nuts and bolts of his relationship with Palmer (a sharper script would have been able to lay a more believable foundation in the first act for us to then be more attached by the third), there are effective moments showcasing the prejudices faced by kids who don’t conform to the gender norms we still thrust on to them. It’s told in broad strokes, but then stories like this, in order to reach a wider, judgmental audience who might need a bit of spoon-feeding, often need to be, and while I craved more substance and knottiness from the film, it’s a small step in the right direction with regards to a specific form of representation. It would have been understandable, and perhaps merciful, if Timberlake had decided to call it quits as a non-Trolls actor after his mortifyingly miscast turn as a sailor turned lifeguard who dreams of being a playwright in Woody Allen’s equally misjudged Wonder Wheel. Three years on and a gritty lead role in a more stripped back drama should be the one to finally edge him into a more mature stage of his career. But Palmer is the kind of character made for handsome actors who associate depth with beard length, a movie type rather than a living, breathing human being. Timberlake is just about fine, going through the motions with the same plod as the film around him, never truly bad but never good enough, a performance that fails to convince us yet again that live-action acting is a good fit for him. Despite the flashes of something more challenging, Palmer is a film content to play it safe (his true road to redemption is to slot himself into a ready-made nuclear family), a truly whelming experience that wants you to desperately feel everything from tears to joy. But ultimately, the only persistent feeling is that of deja vu, that we’ve been here before too many times, and wouldn’t it be nice if we could go somewhere else instead Palmer is available on Apple TV+ from 29 January	975
We can all agree that the restrictions brought about by Covid have reinforced all the things we previously took for granted. Some miss their loved ones. Some miss the pulsating mass of warm strangers on an unplanned night out. Me? It turns out that I apparently miss the sight of a massive gorilla punching a radioactive sea monster right in the middle of its dumb face. I didn’t know this, of course, until I watched the trailer for Godzilla vs Kong. Ostensibly, Godzilla vs Kong is the grand culmination of a long-gestating plan; a cinematic universe where we are first introduced to the biggest, most iconic creatures in movie history, then gasp in awe as they’re trained upon each other. Ostensibly, to enjoy Godzilla vs Kong, you would need to re-watch and appreciate 2014’s Godzilla, 2017’s Kong: Skull Island and 2019’s Godzilla: King of the Monsters in quick succession. But you’re not going to do that, because the entirety of this film’s backstory is completely contained within its three-word title. It’s a film about King Kong punching Godzilla. And, honestly, I can’t wait. No, really. In terms of sheer cinematic spectacle, the past year has been a total non-starter. I’ve managed to see just two films theatrically in the last 12 months; one was Proxima, a sad French drama about maternal guilt. And the other was Tenet. Tenet, for crying out loud. A film that committed the dual sins of being too incomprehensible to stay awake for and too noisy to sleep through. Tenet was advertised as nothing less than the saviour of the theatrical cinematic experience, which would have been great save for the fact that it wasn’t very good. Now, imagine if Godzilla vs Kong had taken Tenet’s place. Imagine if cinema’s escape plan had been a film where a 120-metre prehistoric allegory for nuclear destruction gets the atomic beam smacked out of its mouth by a gorilla wielding what appears to be a skyscraper aerial like a medieval battleaxe. No, really, imagine it. Because it is my sincere belief that a film like this would have not only kept the cinemas open, but forced the coronavirus into a terrified retreat. I’m exaggerating, but not by much. After the year we’ve all had, the act of watching the Godzilla vs Kong trailer was like getting a massage. It felt like someone had lifted your brain from the top of your skull and carefully dipped it into a nice warm bath. “I know things have been tough”, it seemed to say, “But here’s a film about two gigantic idiots whaling on each other for reasons that aren’t even slightly important. Nothing to worry about here. We’ve got this”. Genuinely, they should put that trailer on the Headspace app. There’s something so relaxing about how completely, unapologetically stupid it is. To see King Kong jump off an exploding boat like he’s auditioning for a 1990s Steven Seagal film. To hear Rebecca Hall say like “I made a promise to protect her, and I think that in some way Kong did the same”. To see the shot where someone has taped the newspaper headline ‘Monarch stumped as to Godzilla’s motives’ onto a map of the world like it is somehow a clue. To hear the agitated choral stirrings on the soundtrack, reminiscent of Ligeti’s Requiem, and think “Bog off, this is a film about a monkey fight”. The whole thing is perfect. True, the film itself could be awful. It could wrongly assume that people want to see a film rich with mythology and well-drawn characters, when all anyone wants to see is King Kong punch Godzilla in the mouth for two hours. It could get bogged down by an over-complicated plot, like Godzilla: King of the Monsters did, when all anyone wants to see is King Kong punch Godzilla in the mouth for two hours. It could have identifiable scenes and motivations, when all anyone wants to see is King Kong punch Godzilla in the mouth for two hours. Any of these would be a crying shame. Because this is what cinema is for. It isn’t about important character pieces, or even tentpole juggernauts. It’s about stupid, middling, March-released monster movies like this, that you only go and see because it’s raining and nothing else is on. It’s about leaving all your expectations at the door and still sort of hating it. It’s about the experience of collectively gasping with the realisation that someone actually made this rubbish. I’m not joking. I miss that. And, as such, Godzilla vs Kong has got me more excited than any film I can remember. Godzilla vs Kong is released in cinemas and on HBO Max in the US on 26 March and in the UK on 21 May	955
Here is a squawking, gobbling, factory-farmed turkey, and it’s a shame because its co-creators Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead are a film-making duo known for interesting sci-fi horror fantasy. In 2017, they gave us a very intriguing indie movie called The Endless, in which they also starred as two thirtysomething brothers who 10 years previously had been freed from a sinister cult, but make a strange decision to revisit this creepy brotherhood whose world now seems more interesting than their current banal existence. That was a very atmospheric, if confused film. Sadly, all the problems with it seem to have magnified for this muddled and exasperatingly slow and pointless drama. Anthony Mackie and Jamie Dornan play Steve and Dennis, two careworn paramedics in New Orleans having to deal with the casualties of a new synthetic drug called Synchronic with time-travel powers. The problem with “imaginary drug” films is that they’re an easy and unearned route to excitement, and only a very rigorously clear and consistent narrative, and preferably a humorous script, can make them work. Ariel Schulman and Henry Joost’s Project Power (2020) was another imaginary-street-drug-in-New-Orleans film that was successful because of bright performances from a cast headed by Jamie Foxx. Similarly, Neil Burger’s Limitless (2011), with Bradley Cooper’s washed-up loser getting a mega-IQ boost from a brain pill, was viable as raucous satire. But Synchronic is frankly just silly and tedious, with faintly absurd and jeopardy-free time-travel scenes and a dramatic focus hopelessly split between Dennis and Steve’s separate but equally tiresome lives. There is a laugh when Mackie’s exhausted time-traveller comes back to the present and declares to his video diary: “The past fuckin’ sucks, man.” As does so much else. • Synchronic is available on digital platforms from 29 January.	345
This is the much-admired feature debut of Georgian director Dea Kulumbegashvili, part of the official selection for last year’s cancelled Cannes film festival, where it might well have been a shock-cinema talking point had the event gone ahead. It is co-produced by the Mexican film-maker Carlos Reygadas, whose influence is very apparent, and the movie as a whole is an intensely, indeed overbearingly, curated and controlled experience. It is a succession of disquieting tableaux, shot mainly from fixed camera positions in which the relevant action can be happening very far away, and one of the speakers can be off-camera for long periods: a cinema in the high style of Haneke, Farhadi and Kiarostami. Yana (Ia Sukhitashvili) and David (Rati Oneli, the co-writer) are a devout Jehovah’s Witness couple with a child who preside over a newly-built prayer house in a remote community. When a religious meeting is firebombed by bigoted locals, David makes an official complaint to the (equally bigoted) police about their marked lack of effort or interest in finding the culprits, and makes a trip to Tbilisi to discuss matters with community elders. Meanwhile, Yana is left behind and is menaced and assaulted by someone claiming to be a cop. The central rape scene is very disturbingly shot and there is also what I admit is a potent final sequence, imagining some kind of retribution or spiritual degradation happening to the assailant in geological time. But there is something inert and frankly shallow in the film: a refrigerated mannerism in which rape and religious beliefs are both kinds of arthouse artefact, not made any more authentic or compelling by the suggestions of Yana’s own ambiguous attitude to what has just happened. Kulumbegashvili’s style is confident, if derivative. Her technique now has to evolve away from these self-conscious influences. • Beginning is available on Mubi from 29 January.	352
The Spanish illustrator Josep Bartolí lived enough life to fill a dozen epic biopics. He fought against Franco’s fascists and fled over the Pyrenees into France with 500,000 other refugees in early 1939. After escaping from an internment camp, he made his way to Mexico, where he became a lover of Frida Kahlo. In New York, he was friends with Rothko and Pollock, and designed sets for Hollywood – until his name ended up on the blacklist. Now his life has been turned into a film: not an epic, but a slender and haunting French animation focusing on his years as a prisoner in France. It’s the feature debut of Aurélien Froment, best known as a cartoonist for Le Monde where his work appears under the name Aurel. He frames the film with the fictional story of an elderly French man, Serge (voiced by Gérard Hernandez), who’s telling his grandson about his stint as a fresh-faced gendarme working as a guard at an internment camp. We see him as a young man (voiced by Bruno Solo), a gentle soul with a pleasant face. (He reminded me of a Raymond Briggs character.) His colleagues mock him for refusing to abuse prisoners, who are treated more like criminals than refugees. Secretly, Serge makes friends with one of the Spanish, a handsome man with a magnificent hooked nose, who is constantly drawing – scribbling pictures on cutlery, walls, in the dirt with his finger. He is Bartolí (Sergí Lopez). Aurel draws scenes inside the camp in a grim camouflage of greys and dust browns, and shows us Bartolí’s angry, Goya-like drawings of the horrors: prisoners’ faces ravaged by disease and hunger, contorted with despair. Often the image remains still, the characters’ expressions and movements static – frozen like memories fixed in the brain after all these years. It’s a delicate, thoughtful film, moving and real. Not utterly bleak either, ending with a rampage of colour and life in Mexico – and a brilliantly sweary cameo from Kahlo. • Josep is available on Mubi from 28 January.	404
Keira Knightley has expressed her discomfort with shooting intimate scenes, saying that she will no longer do so if the film is directed by a man. In conversation with director Lulu Wang and writer-producer Diane Solway on the Chanel Connects podcast, Knightley credited the “male gaze” and her own personal vanity with the decision. “If I was making a story that was about that journey of motherhood and body acceptance, I feel like, I’m sorry, but that would have to be with a female film-maker,” Knightley said. “I don’t have an absolute ban, but I kind of do with men.” She continued: “I don’t want it to be those horrible sex scenes where you’re all greased up and everybody is grunting. I’m not interested in doing that. “I feel very uncomfortable now trying to portray the male gaze. Saying that, there’s times where I go, ‘Yeah, I completely see where this sex would be really good in this film and you basically just need somebody to look hot.’ “So therefore you can use somebody else, because I’m too vain and the body has had two children now and I’d just rather not stand in front of a group of men naked.” “We all empathise with men hugely because, culturally, their experience is so explored. We know so many aspects of even male sexuality. But we don’t feel like men can say, ‘Yes, I understand what you’re talking about because I’ve got this wealth of art and film and theatre and TV from your point of view.’” Knightley has spoken in the past of clashes with male directors, launching a broadside against male colleagues in a 2018 essay: “They tell me what it is to be a woman. Be nice, be supportive, be pretty but not too pretty, be thin but not too thin, be sexy but not too sexy, be successful but not too successful. … But I don’t want to flirt and mother them, flirt and mother, flirt and mother. I don’t want to flirt with you because I don’t want to fuck you, and I don’t want to mother you because I am not your mother. … I just want to work, mate. Is that OK? Talk and be heard, be talked to and listen. Male ego. Stop getting in the way.” She has also spoken of the impossible position some women are left in unless they act either flirty or maternal. “Before motherhood, you’re sexy, but if we talk about the whole vagina-splitting thing then that’s terrifying; there’s no sex there, so what we do is go into the virgin-mother retrofit, that’s nice and safe. The problem with those two images is I think very few women actually identify with them. Women are meant to play the flirt or the mother in order to get their voice heard. I can’t. It makes me feel sick.” Knightley’s most recent role was in Philippa Lowthorpe’s Misbehaviour, in which she played an activist who stormed the stage at the 1970 Miss World ceremony, in protest at its sexism. Her next film is Silent Night, a Christmas comedy co-starring Matthew Goode, Annabelle Wallis and directed by first-timer Camille Griffin.	652
Spike Lee has likened Donald Trump to Hitler in an acceptance speech at a film critics awards show, adding that “the whole world is laughing at the United States”. The director made his comments when he accepted a special award from the New York Film Critics Circle for his short film New York, New York. The film was released in May 2020 and Lee described it as a “love letter to its people”. Lee said the comments about the Trump were recorded on 6 January, the day of the Capitol breach, which he said was “a very sad day in the history of America”. “We are living in a very serious time in America,” said the director. “His president, President Agent Orange, will go down in history with the likes of Hitler … all his boys, they are going down on the wrong side of history.” Lee has a history of sparring with Trump, including calling him a “motherfucker” over Trump’s response to the 2017 Charlotteville protests, during which activist Heather Heyer was murdered by white supremacist James Fields. Trump accused him of a “racist hit on your president” after an earlier acceptance speech by Lee at the 2019 Oscars.	233
Here’s a question: was Wonder Woman 1984 a hit movie? How did it compare to the first Wonder Woman? Or how about Soul, or Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom? Were they hits? How can we tell? In ordinary times we wouldn’t have to ask; we would have box-office figures to go by. Now, the pandemic has hobbled cinema-going, and for most of us the only way to access new movies is via streaming services, which tend to guard their numbers as if they’re nuclear launch codes. WW84, for example, got a limited cinema release but was mainly consumed in the US via HBO Max. How did it do there? All Warners said was that it had “broken records and exceeded our expectations”. If Hollywood is a place where “nobody knows anything”, streaming is a place where we know even less. So as Netflix unveils its formidable slate of star-studded new movies for 2021, it is hard to know how excited to get. This time next year, it will be just as hard to know how excited we were. In late 2019, Netflix changed the metric by which it gauges its “most-watched original films”. Previously, viewers had to have watched at least 70% of a film for it to count. Now it’s just two minutes. By that measure, its top films of 2020 were Extraction, Spenser Confidential and 6 Underground: all macho, mid-ranking action movies that generated very little wider buzz, and you suspect would have barely dented the box office had they been released in cinemas. There are other ways to judge whether movies are popular. We have professional critics, of course, who are never, ever wrong. Which is why they can pan movies such as Venom or Transformers and audiences flock to them regardless. Same goes for awards panels (*cough* Green Book). Even review aggregators such as Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic are now open to question, and possibly manipulation. Right after it opened, WW84 had a Rotten Tomatoes score of 90%. A few weeks later, after more reviews had been taken into account, it dipped below the site’s “fresh” threshold of 60%. What happened there? We still have our excellent individual tastes to go by, and streamers are very good at catering to those (rather than giving out data about their movies, they collect data on us). But one of the great things about box-office figures is that they offer nowhere to hide. There is no disputing a franchise-spawning smash such as The Matrix or Avatar, or disguising a bomb such as Cats. We celebrate those successes and revel in those failures together. It’s Darwinian but democratic. It binds us as a society. With streaming, we might get exactly the same good and bad movies, but served as more of an algorithmically curated mulch of “meh”, which nobody consumes in the same way. That doesn’t bode well for the future of movies as popular culture.	584
A book can crack open a whole new world for the reader. In the case of Australia’s all-female-directed horror film anthology, Dark Whispers, a mysterious ancestral book left upon a mother’s passing to her daughter becomes the very literal entrance point into an unsettling universe. For us, what lies inside is an eclectic bundle of 10 short films, ranging from a gothic animation, to a twisted mermaid fantasy, to an Indonesian ghost story. It was conceived by writer-director Megan Riakos, who issued a call-out to Australian women filmmakers for new or existing works, and those selected were granted their own unique chapter in the anthology. There’s real pop to the directorial visions on display in this assortment of psychological thrillers, some of which dip their toes into horror. The visually striking homage to old-school horror in Janine Hewitt’s 2005 short The Intruder, starring Asher Keddie (pre-Offspring fame) as Zoe, is gorgeously shot on 35mm film. With a raging storm outside, there’s plenty of dramatic, flashing lightning and shadowy interiors to keep the suspense alive in the short running time. When Zoe’s estranged friend Angela (Bree Desborough) unexpectedly arrives at her doorstep, it trades loud jump scares for the stewing fear of a lingering presence outside. Another highlight is Kaitlin Tinker’s The Man Who Caught a Mermaid (2016), which plays tonally as a light, jovial comedy before unleashing its disillusioned and delusional male protagonist, Herb (Roy Barker). Isabel Peppard’s 2006 stop-motion Gloomy Valentine finds tragic melancholy in its Corpse Bride-like leading lady; her sunken facial features and shattered heart gorge a visceral, bloody grief. Anthologies have had a formidable part to play in the horror film genre, with 1945’s Dead of Night helping to popularise the format. In the Australian context, there are Tracey Moffat’s Bedevil and Warwick Thornton’s The Darkside, as well as the recent all-Indigenous-helmed Dark Places. All unveil the breadth and depth of the local talent pool: there’s no lack of exciting, diverse national filmmakers working in these spaces. Time, though, in the anthology’s packed-in presentation, is crucial in making an impression. So it’s in the details that some stories shine over others, especially in how quickly they’re able to conjure up mood and deliver sometimes complex ideas. Briony Kidd’s Watch Me (2016) is a challenging story of an unhinged famous actor’s desperate spiral in front of her boyfriend and personal assistant; and Dorset-set The Ride (2011), starring Anthony LaPaglia, leans too heavily and swiftly into the overt racism of its dangerous white male saviour. Despite this, there are some effective performances in the tearful eyes of Rachael (Sarah Bollenberg) in the claustrophobic, elevator-situated Birthday Girl (2008), as well as in Indigenous supernatural thriller Storytime (2005), where a child goes missing within the tangled roots of the mangroves in the Kimberley region. The narrative binding these stories together centres on Clara (Andrea Demetriades) who, upon coming across the Book of Dark Whispers, becomes compelled to read on: first out of curiosity, then by a more elusive fear. Every time a story ends, there’s either a visual or sound cue that spills over into real life, such as when blood drips from Clara’s teeth on to the page, after she “reads” Grillz, Lucy Gouldthorpe’s 2015 black-and-white vampiric Tinder romance. It’s unfortunate that the framing device is less than inspired, if tacked-on, with little connection between it and the short stories themselves. As a whole, Dark Whispers is scattershot in its consistency from one tale to the next, partly due to its nature as a compilation of films from a spectrum of filmmakers’ varying tastes. For instance, it’s a jarring switch in era and aesthetic between the lo-fi dreamy magic realism of Katrina Irawati Graham’s White Song to the crisper, modern-day young adult comedy of Little Share House of Horrors. When appreciated separately, though, there’s distinctive artistry and promise in each chapter. The subtitle to Dark Whispers is “Volume I”, suggesting both an intended sequel and the fact that, if one chooses to look for it, there’s an abundance of untapped talent in the pages and beyond. • Dark Whispers is available to stream in Australia and the UK through multiple video-on-demand services	846
“When you’ve got the high ground you control everything,” Travis (Simon Baker) tells Gutjuk (Jacob Junior Nayinggul) during a key moment in director Stephen Johnson’s meat pie western, shot on location in Kakadu national park and Arnhem Land and set in the early 20th century. This is what we call a “title drop”, an oddly satisfying moment given it simply consists of a person inside the narrative universe pronouncing the title of the film. It isn’t one of those eye-rolling title drops, like when grizzly old Liam Neeson grumbled “she’s been taken” in Taken, or when a man unhelpfully told Casey Affleck “I pray for her, because she’s gone baby gone” in ... yes ... Gone Baby Gone. Johnson’s film – written by Chris Anastassiades and produced by Witiyana Marika, who was one of the founding members of Yothu Yindi and appears in a supporting role – has big things on its mind, such as the cyclical nature of violence and coming to terms with colonial Australia’s brutal history. In Johnson’s hands, this title drop is an opportunity to raise ideas about the film’s subtext and characters. The high ground is literal and symbolic. Travis is a sniper who positions himself on rocks and hills before scenes of confrontation (literal) and is also a fundamentally decent person, quitting the police force to become a bounty hunter after being appalled by the covering up of a massacre (moral and symbolic). Gutjuk takes Travis’s spiel about the high ground seriously, passing messages about how to “control and engage” on to other people. It feels weird for a white man to convey the key philosophy of a film that explores the brutal impact of settlement, though High Ground avoids the “white saviour” trope despite coming a little too close for comfort, with several moments of heroism and sacrifice establishing Travis as the moral centre of the picture. In the lead up to the first violent moment, Johnson depicts daily activities within an Indigenous community – a trio of men hunting for food, a young boy rehearsing spear motions – situated around an idyllic lake . When on-the-run bandits and police burst into the community and wholesale murder ensues, the point has been made that this scene is not just about the destruction of a single community but of a culture, a people, a way of living. Gutjuk is one of the survivors of the massacre and is subsequently raised on a Christian mission. He reunites with Travis 12 years after the event, the sharp-shooter recruiting him as a tracker after his former police chief (Jack Thompson) asks him to help hunt down another survivor, the vengeful Baywara (Sean Mununggurr). Like The Nightingale and The Furnace – two other recent westerns that ask important questions about Australia’s past – the relationship between a white principal character and a person of colour is core to the film. But while the relationship between Billy (Baykali Ganambarr) and Clare (Aisling Franciosi) felt intimately close in The Nightingale, and likewise for the friendship between Hanif (Ahmed Malek) and Mal (David Wenham) in The Furnace, a sense of distance splinters the relationship between Travis and Gutjuk in High Ground; the tensions between them feel under-explored. This has to do in part with gaps in time and geographical distances that separate them, as well as complex feelings Gutjuk has for Travis. But Johnson and screenwriter Anastassiades may also be held back by their fondness for Baker’s character. The film prioritises his perspective (which is reflected in its title) and is at pains to show him behaving valiantly – including killing his own men for harming Indigenous people and a significant climactic moment I won’t divulge here. Jacob Junior Nayinggul is a commanding and enigmatic presence as Gutnik; I wondered what the film would be like if it were framed more fully from his perspective. Baker is fine as the stoic Australian male: the stern and carefully spoken type who doesn’t say much, but when he does it counts. The great Aaron Pedersen is underused in a side role that’s also gruff and forbearing (with a Jay Swan-esque twang) and Ryan Corr doesn’t get to do much as a priest, despite the influence of Christianity on Indigenous communities being significantly underexplored in Australian film. Andrew Commis’ cinematography avoids the gluggy, highly saturated look associated with intense outback heat, with handheld camerawork that feels gently inquisitive. Small visual detours sprinkled throughout explore the natural world – from raptors gliding in the sky (visions of which become visual callbacks) to snakes slithering around and blades of grass oscillating in the breeze. These images are presented matter-of-factly, for the purpose of evoking environmental detail rather than creating a psychological impression of the landscape (as in the 1971 classic Walkabout). High Ground never comes close to matching the bittersweet majesty of Sweet Country or the painful polemic of The Nightingale – but it’s well made and directed gracefully, offsetting hard-hitting sequences with handsome production values. • High Ground is in Australian cinemas from 28 January	971
Chock full of delightful narrative surprises, imaginative genre tweaks, and warming performances from its two leads, this low-budget romcom-horror story is worth seeking out. Director Adam Stovall, who co-wrote the script with the film’s star MacLeod Andrews, makes an impressive feature debut with an obviously teensy budget. It’s smartly deployed to cover essentially one set, some theatrical makeup and kit for some fetching black-and-white cinematography that simultaneously recalls vintage-era spooky movies of the 30s as well as too-cool-for-school early Jim Jarmusch films such as Stranger Than Paradise. Andrews’ protagonist Jack is a handyman who works for a property management company. His job is to check over houses for damage and do some light cleaning after tenants move out. However, it looks as if the former residents of an ordinary looking, two-storey suburban house left in a hurry, leaving all their possessions behind; Jack’s boss wants him to find out why so many previous clients similarly skipped out in a rush. Turns out it’s because the place is haunted by Muriel (Natalie Walker), a “spectral agent”, as she insists on being called, who has felt a particular sense of ownership over the building for many years. At first, Jack doesn’t even notice the doors opening by themselves or the lights turning on, but eventually Muriel gets his attention and makes herself visible; the two discover a spiritual affinity of sorts, that grows into a friendship and more. Like Tim Burton’s Beetlejuice, the script’s world-building posits a kind of afterlife bureaucracy in charge of hauntings, albeit one that seems to have gone through a very 21st-century style rebranding that has banished use of the word “ghost”. Muriel is a respected worker, but her boss, officious desk ghoul Ms Henry (Amanda Miller), is determined to undermine her and puts another co-worker (Sydney Vollmer) on the case as well. All of this ensures the film is not in the least bit scary, and clears room emotionally for a conclusion that’s as weird as it is apt and genuinely moving. Choice musical cuts from Honeyhoney, the Bengsons and Wussy further enhance the film’s insouciant street cred. • A Ghost Waits is released on the Arrow player in the UK, US and Canada on 1 February.	437
“She might be crazy, or she might be the sanest person I’ve ever met.” Some cringingly obvious lines really lower the tone of this deep south melodrama (released in the US last year with the title Tuscaloosa). It’s an adaptation of Glasgow Phillips’s novel about a white kid in early-70s Alabama: a psychiatrist’s son, he falls in love with one of his dad’s patients. The director is Philip Harder, a veteran music promo maker who evokes time and place with the intoxicatingly intense colour and heightened reality of a William Eggleston photograph. But his film, though well-meaning, is disappointingly tame and soap opera-ish. What it has got going for it is a trio of gusty, heart-on-sleeve performances. Devon Bostick is terrific as Billy, a charismatic dope-smoking drop-out who’s back home in Alabama mooching about, working as a gardener at his dad’s psychiatric hospital. One day, he spots beautiful new inpatient Virginia (Natalia Dyer), who tells him she’s not crazy and that her dad locked her up for being a nymphomaniac. Dyer’s intelligent and sensitive performance does wonders for a character who, on the page, looks like a male fantasy: a cool-girl psychiatric case, fun-loving, free-spirited and up for anything. Marchánt Davis completes the trio as Nigel, Billy’s African American childhood friend. He joins a group of militant civil rights activists and becomes the target of racist cops, but there’s just too much going on to properly explore the dynamics of the two men’s friendship. Another subplot in flashback reveals the death in mysterious circumstances of Billy’s mother when he was a child – a storyline that seems to exist purely to fend off criticism that here we have a film about brutal racism and oppression of women told from the perspective of a privileged white man. • Summer of ’72 is available on digital platforms from 1 February.	371
Disney is to overhaul its Jungle Cruise theme park attraction to remove what it describes as “negative depictions of native peoples” and to “reflect and value the diversity of the world around us”. The changes were outlined in a blogpost on its Disney Parks website, which included concept art for the redesigned attraction, a simulated riverboat ride originally developed for Disneyland when it opened in California in 1955. It has since been replicated in Disney theme parks in Florida, Tokyo and Hong Kong. In a statement quoted by USA Today, Disney added that its designers “are addressing negative depictions of native people while adding a humorous storyline … this group of adventurers [will] be diverse – in background and fields of interest”. Partly inspired by the 1951 film The African Queen, Jungle Cruise has long been a target of criticism for its inclusion of caricatures of indigenous people as well as a character, Trader Sam, who offers “heads” for sale. A post by design group Thinkwell calls elements of the attraction “horrifyingly racist”. Disney’s redesign of the Jungle Cruise follows its decision, announced in June 2020, to rework its Splash Mountain attraction. Originally inspired by the now repudiated 1946 film Song of the South, Splash Mountain is being modelled on its 2009 animation, The Princess and the Frog, the first to contain an African American princess. A film version of Jungle Cruise, starring Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt, has had its release delayed until July 2021.	283
A classical pianist gives birth to a hearing-impaired son in Israeli director Itay Tal’s impressive feature debut. You could interpret his film as an allegory of tiger parenting and other child-raising techniques with gimmicky names. And the script raises all sorts of questions about whether talent is innate, how far it is influenced by genes, and whether it needs to be developed while young. Tal refrigerates these questions into an elegant and disturbing family drama that has echoes of Michael Haneke: it’s a film with a shard of ice lodged in its heart. Naama Preis is the pregnant pianist, Anat, who is on stage when her waters break. Not missing a beat, she carries on playing, amniotic fluid trickling into her shoe. At the hospital, routine tests reveal that her baby son is deaf – further investigations will be needed. I watched what Anat does next with my hands covering my face; it is a heart-stopping moment of scary-but-not-scary cinema. The story then skips ahead a few years. Anat has given up the piano to focus on moulding her son, Idam, into a musical prodigy. He performs in public for the first time aged seven or so. Later, there’s an unbearably tense scene as he sits down at 12 to play in front of the wider family after dinner. All of them are pianists, and musical greatness is the only measure of success. Anat’s father, a well-known composer, demanding and severe, is hypercritical of the boy’s technique. Through all of this Anat’s face is inscrutable, impossible to read. Is she numbed by guilt or has being raised in this toxic environment warped her self-esteem and sense of family life? Another director would insert epic meltdowns here, but Tal keeps things cool and collected – and his supremely satisfying film gets the job done in 80 minutes. • Available on Your Screen.	359
Cannes 2021 just got hotter. The annual film festival, which prides itself on launching the premieres – and careers – of some of the world’s top directors, will now take place at the height of summer, following concerns over the Covid pandemic. The festival had been scheduled to take place from 11-22 May; now it will run from 6-17 July. “As announced last autumn, the Festival de Cannes reserved the right to change its dates depending on how the global health situation developed,” explained a press release on Wednesday. Variety had reported last week that July was the most likely choice, with organisers extremely keen to host a physical edition of the festival after last year’s was called off following a series of postponements. Holding the event in July would mean that Cannes retains more than a month’s head start on the autumn festivals: Venice, Telluride and Toronto, which begin in late August. The Cannes Lions advertising festival is scheduled to take place as planned in the city’s Palais des Festivals in June. Local hoteliers were reported to be positive about the change as their hopes of a normal tourist season this year rapidly diminished. The event usually attracts some 200,000 visitors to the Riviera hotspot, generating an estimated 200m euros’ (£176m) worth of economic benefits for the area. Cannes general delegate Thierry Frémaux had mooted the idea of extending the festival’s length due to the likelihood of a backlog of high-quality films delayed by the pandemic; this appears to have ditched. After the festival was cancelled in 2020, Frémaux presented a selection of more than 50 films, including Wes Anderson’s as-yet-unreleased The French Dispatch, Pixar animation Soul, which premiered on streaming platform Disney+ in December, and Lovers Rock and Mangrove from Steve McQueen’s Small Axe anthology for the BBC. Premieres at the 2019 edition included Parasite, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Pain and Glory, Sorry We Missed You and Portrait of a Lady on Fire. The Sundance film festival begins later this week in a wholly virtual format. The Berlin film festival, which is normally in February, will now take place in two stages: digital only in March and physical in June.	420
Michael Caine already has the distinction of appearing in what many believe is the greatest Dickens adaptation of all time: The Muppets Christmas Carol, in which he played Scrooge. Now he is Fagin in this try-hard modern reboot of Oliver Twist, in which the plot and indeed meaning of the original has been jettisoned, leaving few of the characters – though the original’s tiny, sticky-fingered tealeaves are now promoted to supercool young adulthood. It never really comes to life and there’s a kids-TV feel to most of it, although the free-running scenes are watchable enough, and Caine’s disguise as a grumpy Russian plutocrat with a fake moustache raises some laughs. Rafferty Law (the dead spit of his dad, Jude Law) plays Twist, a young graffiti artist who gets roped into street crime and finds himself hanging out with some cheeky but nonviolent young chancers in Fagin’s employ: a gender-switched Dodge (Rita Ora), and a character called Red (Sophie Simnett), who is in an abusive relationship with another gender-switched character, Sikes, played by Lena Headey. Caine’s Fagin turns out to be a former art dealer ruined by an unscrupulous competitor (enjoyably played by David Walliams), so Fagin plans an elaborate robbery to get his own back on this absolute rotter. And so we are in caper-theft territory, with people disguising themselves as police officers, lowering themselves into lifts from a hole in a ceiling, spray painting over CCTV cameras and pinching Old Masters. Noel Clarke and Jason Maza are Brownlow and Bedwin, the flat-footed coppers on Twist’s trail, but hardly able to keep up with his parkour shenanigans. This movie’s not unlikable, but the action and comedy are under par. • Twist is released on Sky Cinema on 29 January.	341
There’s a necrophiliac fascination to this documentary about the life and times of Truman Capote, author of the 1958 novella Breakfast at Tiffany’s – filmed with Audrey Hepburn – and the true-crime reportage masterpiece In Cold Blood from 1966. The latter was about the brutal slaying of a Kansas farming family in which the cold-bloodedness of the crime was matched by the cold-bloodedness of Capote’s literary and journalistic performance – befriending the culprits with prison visits and privately agitating for their death penalty to give his book a sensational ending. If anyone had the splinter of ice in the heart that Graham Greene said a novelist needed, it was him. Capote was also a gay man in an era when being one was dangerous, but when those prominent in the arts could hide it in plain sight with extravagant mannerisms. Norman Mailer admired his courage and I found myself thinking of a German word invented by the English writer Ben Schott: schmetterlingsschnauze, or “butterfly jaws” – the toughness of the dandy. This film from Ebs Burnough, based on a cache of audiotaped interviews with Capote’s intimates made by Paris Review editor George Plimpton, is chiefly about the strange case of Capote’s unfinished novel, Answered Prayers. This was his anatomy of the New York idle rich with whom Capote mingled and for whom he threw the supposedly legendary Black and White Ball in New York in 1966, a bafflingly iconic event whose guest list – like the cast of people on whom Answered Prayers is based – now seems mostly like a pageant of wealthy mediocrities and Eurotrash narcissists. Maybe Capote’s novel-fragment attacking them was intended as the definitive, contemptuous dismissal: a final flick of the switch on the electric chair. But the contempt was surely also for himself. When a few chapters were published, it apparently lost him some A-lister friends, though he gained new ones to hang out with at Studio 54 in the 70s, including his acolyte Andy Warhol – who was really Capote’s cultural heir in the new age of celebrity. (This film could have said more about their relationship.) It is salutary to be reminded of a great writer, whose heyday was at a time when literary authors were at the centre of culture. Released on 29 January on digital formats.	431
Leaving their home in Jakarta, well-to-do dad Hanif (Ario Bayu), his wife Nadya (Hannah Al Rashid) and their three kids drive to the remote rural orphanage where Hanif grew up. At first, it’s all laughs and backseat bickering – until the car hits something. Having established that the collision was with a now dead deer, they drive off, only for the camera to reveal that the real victim was a child, now dead in a ditch. Up comes the title card, by which point viewers of this Indonesian horror will have some inkling that The Queen of Black Magic isn’t going to mess around. After this unnerving first 10 minutes, there is a long expository lull as an unwieldy cast of characters is introduced. These include the two guys Hanif was best friends with back at the orphanage, their wives, enigmatic servants, two of the current teenage residents, and the dying old man who ran the place. Eventually, after a couple of creepy anecdotes about demons and madwomen locked in bedrooms, the action finally kicks in with a pretty unrelenting stream of horror. Possessions by unquiet spirits result in regurgitated caterpillars, millipedes in eye sockets, someone getting their mouth stapled shut, a woman with an eating disorder mutilating her body, and a bus full of corpses. Then it gets really nasty. Director Kimo Stamboel deploys some clever visual effects and trick camera angles to heighten the gross-out factor – a twist reveals the agent of chaos isn’t just cruel but seeking justice for historical abuse. But ultimately it is all a bit repetitive, derivative (particularly of other Asian horror pics) and somewhat sleep-inducing. • The Queen of Black Magic is available on Shudder from 29 January.	329
Nothing to do with the 1990 musical by Stephen Sondheim about the people throughout history who have tried to kill the US president … yet maybe this film should itself be turned into a musical or opera. It is a documentary about the extraordinary 2017 assassination of Kim Jong-nam, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s half-brother, who had been living in exile in China and was not merely a persistent critic of the regime but seen as a possible alternative ruler. Bizarrely, Kim Jong-nam was killed by having VX nerve agent smeared in his face in Kuala Lumpur international airport’s departure hall by two young women, Siti Aisyah and Doan Thi Houng – from Indonesia and Vietnam respectively – who had been duped by North Korean agents posing as TV producers into thinking they were filming a hidden-camera prank show. The Malaysian government quickly and timidly allowed the North Koreans to go free when the regime effectively held Malaysian embassy staff hostage with their families in Pyongyang. So that left the two vulnerable young women facing a mandatory death penalty for murder, just so the Malaysian legal system could indict someone and save face. It is a gripping story, well told by documentary film-maker Ryan White, with the help of two journalists who covered it at the time: Bloomberg reporter Hadi Azmi and the Washington Post’s former Beijing bureau chief Anna Fifield. There is something genuinely chilling about the way the North Koreans groomed and gaslit their two young victims, making them do dozens of supposed pranks on people over many months, with regular payment and spurious reassurance: eerie dummy-run stunts, just to get them used to the technique. Aisyah and Huong were manipulated like young women being sex-trafficked and, in the strangest, unknowing way, like jihadis being schooled for a big attack. (The nerve-agent element has an extra resonance for the UK after the Russians’ novichok outrage in Salisbury in 2018.) Only the state has access to chemical weapons, and their use is designed to send a sickening message of triumphalism and nationalism. What an extraordinary story of sexism, violence, diplomatic bad faith and dishonesty on an international scale. One question remains: who had the bizarre yet satanically clever idea of a fake prank show? And how is it that the North Koreans, supposedly marooned in their Soviet past, managed to dream up something dripping with contemporary media irony? It could be down to a certain mysterious Japanese national who was identified as an accomplice, but never tracked down.

Dennis Harvey, the veteran film critic whose review of Promising Young Woman has sparked a furore across the industry, has hit back at accusations of misogyny amid calls for Variety to fire him. Harvey’s review was published more than a year ago, following the film’s premiere at the Sundance film festival. Largely positive, it called Mulligan’s performance “skilful, entertaining and challenging” while also querying the central casting. While “a fine actress”, wrote Harvey, Mulligan “seems a bit of an odd choice as this admittedly many-layered apparent femme fatale”. Discussing the character’s deliberate artifice in more depth, Harvey noted that “Margot Robbie is a producer here, and one can (perhaps too easily) imagine the role might once have been intended for her. Whereas with this star, Cassie wears her pickup-bait gear like bad drag; even her long blonde hair seems a put-on.” Mulligan objected to the review, telling the New York Times in December: “I felt like it was basically saying that I wasn’t hot enough to pull off this kind of ruse. “It drove me so crazy … I was like, ‘Really? For this film, you’re going to write something that is so transparent? Now? In 2020?’ I just couldn’t believe it.” Variety responded by adding an editor’s note at the top of Harvey’s review, apologising for “insensitive language” but leaving his words intact. Mulligan reiterated her discomfort at the review earlier this week in a video interview hosted by Variety, prompting renewed abuse of the critic on social media. Speaking to the Guardian, Harvey said he was ill at ease with the way in which Mulligan’s words to the New York Times describing her anger at the review had become received wisdom as to what his review actually said. “I did not say or even mean to imply Mulligan is ‘not hot enough’ for the role,” Harvey said. “I’m a 60-year-old gay man. I don’t actually go around dwelling on the comparative hotnesses of young actresses, let alone writing about that.” Harvey added that he had been “appalled to be tarred as misogynist, which is something very alien to my personal beliefs or politics. This whole thing could not be more horrifying to me than if someone had claimed I was a gung-ho Trump supporter.” Harvey said he avoided the social media discourse triggered by the fallout on the advice of friends who said nobody commenting appeared to have read the review and that some people had said “I must be advocating rape, was probably a predator like the men in the film”. “What I was attempting to write about was the emphasis in the film and [Mulligan’s] performance on disguise, role-playing and deliberate narrative misdirection. Nor was bringing up Margot Robbie meant to be any comparison in ‘personal appearance’. “Robbie is a producer on the film, and I mentioned her just to underline how casting contributes to the film’s subversive content – a star associated with a character like Harley Quinn [Robbie’s Suicide Squad character] might raise very specific expectations, but Mulligan is a chameleon and her very stylised performance keeps the viewer uncertain where the story is heading.” Harvey conceded he may not have expressed such a sentiment specifically enough in his review, but said that he was driven by a desire to withhold the plot’s twists and turns from the audience. “I assumed that film-makers who created such a complex, layered movie wouldn’t interpret what I wrote as some kind of simpleminded sexism. And while Carey Mulligan is certainly entitled to interpret the review however she likes, her projection of it suggesting she’s ‘not hot enough’ is, to me, just bizarre. I’m sorry she feels that way. But I’m also sorry that’s a conclusion she would jump to, because it’s quite a leap.” Mulligan’s publicists have not yet responded to the Guardian’s request for comment. Harvey also highlighted the discrepancy between the reaction of the film’s star and its US distributor, who “immediately asked permission to use multiple pullquotes from the review in their marketing a year ago”. He also queried the timing of the controversy, noting that his review had apparently been found unobjectionable enough to escape complaint for 11 months, “until the film was finally being released, promoted and Oscar-campaigned”. Only then was his review “belatedly labelled ‘insensitive’ and flagged with an official ‘apology’”. Variety’s editors had not raised any concerns with the review when he first filed it, said Harvey, nor in subsequent months until the New York Times article. His professional fate remains uncertain. “It’s left in question whether after 30 years of writing for Variety I will now be sacked because of review content no one found offensive until it became fodder for a viral trend piece.”	959
Until relatively recently, an apology in the arts review columns of any publication was vanishingly rare, if not non-existent. If crow had to be eaten, it would be the end result of some unprecedented legal action in which defendant and plaintiff had grimly established – through a poker-game exchange of solicitor’s letters – what the likely outcome would be in court. Not any more. In 2018 the New York Times’s then drama critic Ben Brantley issued an apology after being accused of transphobia for a quip about the Broadway musical Head Over Heels. He had affected a satirical confusion about its star, the trans performer Peppermint whose character identified as non-binary. Now Variety – a magazine with a first-class roster of film critics – has felt the need to apologise for its review of the Carey Mulligan movie Promising Young Woman, in which the reviewer Dennis Harvey said that he thought Mulligan had been miscast. Harvey wrote that “though a fine actress”, Mulligan was “an odd choice” and appeared to be in “bad drag”. He said the film’s producer Margot Robbie may have been better in such a confrontationally sexual role. The review was published in January 2020, but after Mulligan attacked it in an interview, Variety has done something that can only be described as having your humble pie and eating it. They have run an apology: “Variety sincerely apologises to Carey Mulligan and regrets the insensitive language and insinuation in our review … that minimized her daring performance.” But they’re still running the review below, with the supposedly offensive passage quite intact. That is very feeble of them. And in the immortal words of Christopher Hitchens: “Apologies are a bore. What we want is an explanation.” Maybe Mulligan was particularly angry about this review because it appeared in a magazine considered to be the industry bible, vital in awards seasons, and so a review is closer to a school’s Ofsted report than the subjective piece it might be in other publications. And as the Telegraph’s Robbie Collin suggests, it could well be that Variety’s sheepish half-climbdown is due to a cringing fear of the all-powerful studio and talent PRs, ferociously threatening to close down access to the stars in their stable. But that is not the point. There are legions of women commenting on social media today to say that – guess what – they too are bored, in the withering Hitchens sense, with Variety’s timid semi-apology and what they want is a broader and more diverse range of critical opinions and more women’s voices coming through. And something else too: they will want critical freedom and publications with the intellectual courage to back them up. For what this is worth, I disagree sharply with Harvey about Mulligan being miscast. She doesn’t just do “English rose” personae. This is a performance to compare more with her brilliantly challenging and transgressive role in Steve McQueen’s Shame. But critics are allowed to have opinions, however disagreeable, and even make remarks about an actor’s image up there on the screen – as long as they are offered in good critical faith, which I think the Variety review was. Mulligan is entitled to her opinion as well, and critics are not immune from criticism.	623
Most of us have a movie that we turn to again and again when times are hard – whether it’s to distract us, remind us that life can be amazing or just confirm that some people have it much, much worse. It could be a romantic comedy, a feelgood fantasy, a musical, a sci-fi epic, or a disaster flick. When our film critic ranked his favourite comfort films last year, his list included Babe and Galaxy Quest alongside Casablanca and Titanic. What’s your favourite comfort movie – and what makes it so special? Is it something about the plot, the characters or the issues, or the way they resonate with your own life or bring back memories of happier moments? We would love to hear from you.

Some films have to work harder than others to get bums on seats. Some can charm audiences with big stars, or the lure of a continuing franchise, or the promise of a scene where King Kong takes a swing at Godzilla like he’s half-cut in a Wetherspoons car park. And then, right at the other end of the scale, is Spencer. Make no mistake, Spencer will have to be brilliant to make people go and see it. Better than brilliant, even. It will have to be the perfect movie; entertaining and fun and moving and so technically accomplished that film historians will come to view it as the moment that cinema entered a new epoch. Anything less than that and Spencer is done for. Because it’s just up against so much. Spencer is a film about Princess Diana that will exist in the wake of Emma Corrin’s extraordinary, definitive performance in The Crown; it will star Kristen Stewart. It’s the first feature big feature film to be made about the princess since 2013’s Diana, a film bad enough to be labelled “car crash cinema” by Peter Bradshaw. It has already been heralded as a totem of post-Brexit failure, after it was (apparently inaccurately) reported that Prince William couldn’t be played by anyone with a British passport over visa fears. It’s being filmed in Germany, for crying out loud. Have these people no decency? And now, as production begins, a new image of Stewart as Diana has been released. And, while it would obviously be incredibly stupid to judge an entire movie that hasn’t even been made yet on the basis of a single photo, it looks a little like Spencer might just have pulled it out of the bag. Again, this is all very premature, but there is no denying that Stewart looks like Princess Diana. She’s all eyes and awkward head-tilt, and it’s hard to tell if she’s looking at something that she really likes or something that’s objectively repulsive. That’s the trademark Diana look, and Stewart pulls it off without a hitch. Working against the photo, however, is the fact that Stewart is wearing a black birdcage veil. It’s easy to look vague and mysterious when you’re essentially hiding behind a portable net curtain, but much less so when you’re having to emote at full-tilt at an actor dressed as Prince Charles in broad daylight, which is presumably what 95% of this film is going to be anyway. We do, at least, have some idea what Stewart will sound like. Statistically, given that at the time it felt as if it had been made expressly to be the sixth film anyone would watch on a long-haul flight, you are unlikely to remember anything about Snow White and the Huntsman. However, its one saving grace was Stewart’s British accent. It was entirely convincing, hitting the exact self-conscious, detached-jaw, pseudo-estuary drawl that posh people have adopted now they’ve realised how silly received pronunciation sounds. She sounded exactly like Prince William, basically. That has to work in its favour. What’s more, some more of Spencer’s cast has been announced, and it includes Timothy Spall, Sally Hawkins and Sean Harris, who are all dazzlingly reliable actors. It will be scored by Jonny Greenwood and directed by Pablo Larraín. You’ll remember that Larraín’s last English-language film was Jackie, a work that elevated what had the potential to be a cosily prestigious middlebrow piece of Oscar bait into something so nervy and paranoid that at times it functioned as an all-out horror movie. A Jackie about Princess Diana has the potential to be truly astonishing. So maybe, just maybe, Spencer has what it takes to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. Chuck in a scene where King Kong karate chops Godzilla in the face and I’m sold.	757
There’s a moment so striking and rich with power at the center of Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson’s Summer of Soul (…Or, When The Revolution Could Not Be Televised) that, while watching it, I actually forgot to breathe. It comes as Mavis Staples completes singing her section of the gospel song Take My Hand, Precious Lord. The audience is a packed Harlem park of almost exclusively African Americans who have just heard Dr Martin Luther King eulogized by a man who witnessed his assassination merely one year earlier, the electrifying Rev Jesse Jackson. And they know this was the slain leader’s favorite song. As Staples brings the crowd to a near-stunned state of rapture, she hands the microphone to her mentor, Mahalia Jackson, who simply explodes with cathartic, full-bodied emotion. It goes beyond the category of mere singing, it’s an expression of grief, tenderness, community and healing. And what’s unbelievable is that this footage has been collecting dust in a basement for 50 years. There’s a lot to talk about with Summer of Soul, and part of the story is how this extraordinary event was nearly forgotten. In 1969, a club singer, concert promoter, raconteur and very sharp dresser named Tony Lawrence convinced the New York City parks department to allow him to produce a series of summer concerts in Harlem’s Mount Morris Park (now known as Marcus Garvey Park). He found a sponsor in Maxwell House coffee and had an advocate in John Lindsey, the progressive-for-his-time mayor. Part of the thinking was that the previous year saw riots in Harlem after King’s killing as well as a campus occupation at nearby Columbia University inspired, in part, by sympathetic whites upset the school was building what was essentially a racially segregated gymnasium in Morningside Park. It was determined that free concerts on six consecutive Sundays might release some necessary summer steam. The shows, officially called the Harlem Culture festival, were a revelation. They were marvelously programmed to highlight different avenues of black music, from Motown pop to jazz to Afrobeat to gospel to psychedelic funk. The performers were all thrilled to play in the heart of Harlem, and witnesses reported that they’d never seen such a large gathering of black people in one spot before. The NYPD presence was minimized, and Black Panthers provided security for the talent. Yet despite an unbelievable list of celebrated names like BB King, Stevie Wonder, the 5th Dimension, Sly and the Family Stone, Nina Simone, Max Roach and Abbey Lincoln, Hugh Masekela, Mongo Santamaria, Gladys Knight and the Pips, Babatunde Olatunji, David Ruffin of the Temptations and many more, the filmed record found no buyers. Meanwhile, the three-day festival of predominantly white acts a few hours north that occurred just as this was winding down, Woodstock, became synonymous with the counter-culture generation, and its documentary and soundtrack records made a fortune. Memories of the Harlem Culture festival faded. As producers tried to sell this project back in the day they even branded it Black Woodstock. In some of the new interview footage you can read on the slate that Black Woodstock was Summer of Soul’s working title, but it’s good that it’s been changed. This document is special enough on its own without the comparison. The concerts had separate aims, and Questlove’s film is more than just archival footage. Different performances work as a conduit to different aspects of black musical tradition, be it blues, gospel or Berry Gordy-produced pop, and with each one we get a short, illuminating history. Questlove turns to some of the surviving musicians (and other celebrities) to offer commentary while looking at the material again all these years later, but the most touching moments come from concertgoers who were simply kids from the neighborhood reflecting on a transformative summer. Watching Sly and the Family Stone burn down the stage with their closing number Higher, witness Musa Jackson is moved to tears. You can tell he’s been clinging to these hazy memories for 50 years, and may have even doubted himself when others called his stories of six weeks of free concerts in Harlem crazy. The lack of awareness of this event is another tragic example of black history being ignored. Only this time the record survived, and now we all get to share in it. Summer of Soul (…Or, When The Revolution Could Not Be Televised) screened at the Sundance film festival and is released on 2 July in the US and 16 July in the UK. Thie article was amended on 30 January as Berry Gordy was originally mistakenly referred to as Berry Gordon	882
While life ground to a halt for just about everyone in 2020, Nanfu Wang had a most eventful year. Exactly 12 months ago, the Chinese-born film-maker was at the Sundance Film Festival to sit on the World Cinema Documentary jury while her two-year-old son stayed with her mother in China to prep for the New Year celebrations. But as the threat of Covid-19 grew more urgent by the day, her husband traveled to the Wang family’s remote village to safely retrieve their child. Soon, she would scuttle her plans to convene with them in Asia after wrapping things up in Park City, and start doing everything she could to coordinate the emergency return of her loved ones from a viral hotspot. Wise enough to recognize a rich, important subject when it fell into her lap, she immediately got the wheels turning on a documentary to follow her well-feted 2019 feature One Child Nation, with the goal of taking a closer look at response on the ground in Wuhan and how it relates to the dire events unfolding in the States. She went to work making contacts with photographers and videographers in China and with journalists in the west, most of her quarantined days spent sifting through the hours of eye-opening footage sent back to her. And then in October, amid an on-the-fly production poking the bear of a formidable authoritarian state, the MacArthur Foundation named her an official fellow and awarded her the coveted “Genius Grant”. All of which has now circled back to a Sundance gone virtual as Wang premieres her shocking and heartrending new film In the Same Breath, a clear-eyed assessment of governmental failings on both sides of the Pacific. Last summer, Ai Weiwei’s CoroNation weighed the limited personal freedoms of Xi Jinping’s administration against its ruthless efficacy in quashing a crisis, suggesting that repression and oppression may be the cost of a national death toll around 4,000. Wang’s research calls that number into question, its most stunning revelation that “only a fool” would buy the official party line about how well everything went when the real statistics run in the tens of thousands. Her remote yet trenchant investigation found that officials wallpapered over a plague with propaganda, the cover-ups and denialism leaving the situation to fester until it became far worse than it ever had to. The major point of divergence from the handful of coronavirus docs already released, which have honed their focus to mishandling in the US or abroad, is Wang’s efforts to connect the two. Drawing on her uniquely apropos perspective as a Chinese émigré living in the US for the last nine years, she exposes the parallels in the disinformation campaigns coming from the highest levels of authority. Though a viewer in the English-speaking world may see a trace of the dystopian in the montage of Chinese news anchors repeating the exact same lies word for word, they’re not so far removed from the clips of Trump and even public health crusader Dr Anthony Fauci urging a lax attitude in the pandemic’s early days. Xi’s methods rely on a tightly maintained control and Trump’s seem more rooted in uncaring neglect, and still they’re joined by the impulse to create an image of success as a way of distorting the truth. Human rights activists in the Hubei province are “disappeared” without explanation, while doctors in New Jersey get fired from their hospital jobs for speaking to the press. The anti-mask demonstrators crying hoax at town halls stateside find counterparts in the thoroughly deluded widows thanking the party for its benevolence through their tears of grief. The former group is poisoned by skepticism, the latter by credulousness, two sides of a single coin. Wang builds her political theses around such intimate moments, some touching on her own life. Sobbing mourners recall how they couldn’t hold or see their spouses and parents as they died; ambulance workers race around the city in search of a hospital that won’t turn them away. Passages of pulverizing sadness illustrate the fallout of decisions made in the corridors of power, the real-life stakes charging the reportage with terrible, immediate emotion. So potently poignant are these images that an artistic flourish near the end in which time reverses itself to imagine how it all should have played out lands like an overreach, too false in the face of shattering realness. Business as usual has largely resumed in Wuhan, but Wang’s film contends that that’s just the problem. The same apparatuses of messaging and censorship are still in operation, ensuring that the full extent of the malfeasance may never be fully known. Those survivors of the virus still need to live in a country bent on order over all else, whether that’s over there or over here. Their psychological scarring will last long into the future. In the Same Breath is screening at the Sundance film festival and will be released on HBO later this year with a UK date to be announced	926
George Clooney could be heading to outer space once more after it was announced he had joined the team putting together a reboot of the classic sci-fi series Buck Rogers. The Hollywood Reporter writes that the project, written by Under the Dome’s Brian K Vaughan, could be a “starring vehicle” for Clooney, who will be executive producer of the series. The character Buck Rogers is a war veteran who falls into a coma and wakes up in the 25th century. After the success of a late 70s film a TV series followed starring Gil Gerard, as the US army air corps officer, and Erin Gray. Rogers first appeared in the 1920s before becoming a comic book mainstay in the 1930s, with early radio, TV and film adaptations, all before 1950. Clooney is in the awards race for another post-apocalyptic sci-fi project in the guise of Netflix’s The Midnight Sky. He has joined the project as executive producer, alongside his Smokehouse Pictures partner Grant Heslov, while Flint Dille – the grandson of the original Buck Rogers publisher, John F Dille – will produce. There have been aborted attempts to revive the Rogers franchise, with Frank Miller, the Sin City comic book writer turned film-maker, announcing in 2008 he was working on a film adaptation of the story, but it has never seen the light of day. Earlier reports said the reboot would go back to the character’s first appearance in the 1928 story, Armageddon 2419 AD, where Rogers is introduced as a first world war soldier trapped by a cave-in while investigating strange phenomena in an abandoned Pennsylvania coalmine. In the story, Rogers is exposed to radioactive gas and wakes up nearly 500 years later in the 25th century and helps a resistance force attempt to retake the US, which has been taken over by a conquering force. The original 1970s TV show has been part of a boom in nostalgia-fuelled streaming during the pandemic. It forms part of the lineup on Forces TV, the commercial arm of the British Forces Broadcasting Service, a charity that provides TV and radio for members of the armed forces.	396
If we are ever to get another glimpse into the world of Donnie Darko, Richard Kelly’s phantasmagorical 2001 masterpiece, the time is probably now. Kelly has struggled in the intervening years to reach the heights he sustained with his mindboggling directorial debut, perhaps because his first movie was so perfectly pitched, as if Radiohead had come out with OK, Computer as their debut. The small town of Middlesex, Virginia boasts such an intriguing blend of wormholes, teenage angst and 80s nostalgia that it is a wonder Netflix hasn’t snapped up the rights to a streaming revival. We live in a time in which Karate Kid spinoff Cobra Kai has been seen by 73 million people and Stranger Things, tapping into nostalgia for Reagan-era Stephen King, has become the biggest TV show on the planet. Donnie Darko showed a a similar fascination with the horror and wonder of late 20th-century suburban America, like a time capsule dug up to expose a crusty Sony Walkman loaded with lashings of alt-pop brilliance. It seems perfectly set up for a streaming sequel or prequel, largely because it left so much to the imagination. Kelly has been hinting at a follow-up for years, and recently told comingsoon.net: “I’m probably not allowed to say anything more than there has been an enormous amount of work completed. I’m hopeful that we might get to explore that world in a very big and exciting way. But we’ll see what happens. But there has been a lot of work done.” So where would the follow-up start? Bringing back the original cast might be a key issue, with Jake Gyllenhaal now one of Hollywood’s most sought-after stars. But since Donnie himself didn’t make it all the way to the end of the original movie, there ought to be room for manoeuvre. On the other hand, the movie’s dependence on time travel and alternate realities means there’s ample space for Darko to return. Perhaps a sequel could focus on the troubling legacy of Patrick Swayze’s Jim Cunningham, the weirdo motivational speaker who is exposed as a paedophile thanks to Donnie’s time-travelling antics. It might represent a welcome route back to dramatic roles for Drew Barrymore, most recently seen trying to forge a new career as a talk show host. Her liberal schoolteacher Karen Pomeroy, along with Mary McDonnell’s Rose Darko, in many ways represented the emotional and moral core of the film, their battles with conservative gym teacher Kitty Farmer an prelude to America’s current culture wars. It was also a movie that featured early roles for Maggie Gyllenhaal, Jena Malone and Seth Rogen (in a small role as a thuggish bully), lest we forget. But if Cobra Kai can bring back Elisabeth Shue for an extended cameo, there ought to be no reason why Kelly cannot pull off similar miracles. The film-maker’s vision of curdled conservatism is far from the only disturbing element to his debut. Where the sense of threat in Cobra Kai stems from a legacy of cruel-minded adults who have passed on their flaws to impressionable teenagers and Stranger Things goes for common-or-garden nasties from another dimension, Donnie Darko was always a weirder, neo-dystopian concoction. Make no mistake, this could be a creepy, sinister and off-kilter follow-up. We are never quite sure whether the most terrifying events of the movie are mere manifestations of Donnie’s mental illness. Writers would have to ensure they avoided fetishising psychosis, and yet the apparent link between Donnie’s ability to see into the future and his struggles to control his own mind are what make the story so fascinating. Over to you, Mr Kelly – in this era of nostalgic fan-fulfilment it is surely your turn on the carousel. Let’s hope that, just as in the movie, the story comes full circle and we really do find ourselves once again bouncing to the sounds of Echo &amp; the Bunnymen while delving deeper into the world of Donnie, Middlesex and that giant evil death bunny of doom.	763
The act of censorship cuts to the heart of this lairy, seedy, insidious pulp-horror melodrama from first-time feature director Prano Bailey-Bond, with images and ideas developed from her short Nasty. (She must have thought about using that title again, but Censor has the right technocratic chill.) The film is partly about the way censorship is a cousin to the more value-free business of editing, making sense of experience by cutting things out and rearranging the remaining parts. Memory is a selective, editorial act. It is 1985 in Britain, a time of dialler phones, VHS rentals and indoor smoking, the ruling classes grimly waiting out the miners’ strike and the press in a panic about “video nasties”. Niamh Algar plays Enid, a depressed woman who, with great conscientiousness and professionalism, works as a film censor. (Although, in fact, it was in 1984 that the British Board of Film Censors cut the grumpy, puritan word “censor” and changed its name to the British Board of Film Classification.) Enid has the unpleasant task of sitting through horrible films, with endless rape scenes, alongside her insufferable colleague Sanderson (amusingly played by Nicholas “Nathan Barley” Burns), who waves everything through, while insisting on making undergraduate comparisons to the Gloucester-blinding scene in King Lear. Enid remarks to her female colleague Anne (Clare Perkins) that her male co-workers seem pretty relaxed about male violence against women. Her boss, Fraser (Vincent Franklin), is a stuffy bureaucrat who has a questionably friendly relationship with creepy horror producer Doug (a typically sharp, black-comic turn from Michael Smiley), who breezes in for lunch with Fraser and makes odious sexist remarks to Enid. But Enid has a terrible secret: she is haunted by a childhood trauma of loss, now a “cold case” that the police have long since given up on, and which she has spent her adult life trying to excise from her mind. This impulse explains her current vocation. And then, in the line of duty, she has to watch a strange film called Don’t Go into the Church by a mysterious exploitation director called Frederick North (Adrian Schiller), produced by Doug. The woodland scenes in his film are like the horrifying flashbacks from her own childhood that keep crowding back into her mind. Does this Frederick North know something about her case – does he have the answer to the mystery that her parents and the police couldn’t solve? Is he, in fact, the culprit? The foggy, gloomy texture of Bailey-Bond’s movie has many sense memories of horror: the Italian slasher movies of Joe D’Amato, the under-the-counter sleaze of Michael Powell’s Peeping Tom, and the video-fetish connoisseurship of Harmony Korine’s Trash Humpers, Brad Miska’s V/H/S horror anthology and Hideo Nakata’s J-horror Ringu. I also wonder if in creating Don’t Go into the Church, Bailey-Bond has been influenced by Edgar Wright’s spoof 70s trailer for an imaginary Brit horror called Don’t. Censor returns us to an era when dodgy material that was under the counter could stay hidden. Explicit movies could exist in a shadowy world, where they were just a rumour, a culture that existed below the stratum of respectability, and even finding out about mainstream movies was difficult. Now digital technology and searchable databases have rendered the counter transparent and almost everything can be seen. Bailey-Bond reconstructs the uncanny, almost occult world of film itself, and, using her budget cleverly, projects the 80s from claustrophobic closeups on period detail. Enid even says that phrase that people only say in old movies and TV: “I’ll see myself out.” And she says it at a highly unpleasant moment. With production designer Paulina Rzeszowska and cinematographer Annika Summerson, Bailey-Bond creates something almost unbearably close and oppressive, like the bottom of a murky fish tank. It’s a very elegant and disquieting debut. I wonder what certificate it’s going to get?	764
There’s an earnest old-fashioned Sundance-ness to writer-director Sian Heder’s broad comedy-drama Coda, the kind of warm-hearted crowd-pleaser that the festival is most widely known for. In any normal year, it would probably have been met with audible approval throughout its premiere. But this isn’t a normal year, with the majority of festival goers watching the film at home, perhaps less pumped up by the thrill of seeing it with a crowd. With or without an audience, it’s a minor film, a little too formulaic at times, a tad too comfortable sticking to a dog-eared playbook, eager to be loved but not really trying hard enough to be remembered. Ruby (Brit Emilia Jones, boasting a pitch perfect American accent) is a Coda – a child of deaf adults – who helps her family fishing business while struggling to stay ahead at high school. Her mother (Marlee Matlin), father (Troy Kotsur) and brother (Daniel Durant) need her to translate, and so she’s required to be in five places at once, ensuring her brother isn’t getting ripped off before helping her parents understand an awkward medical diagnosis. But when Ruby decides to join the school choir (to be closer to a crush), she realises that singing is a passion she wants to pursue outside just her bedroom, sparking the interest of her music teacher and the ire of her family. Pleasantly ambling along, hitting every beat one would expect, there’s plenty to like here but nothing to really make it stand out from the crowd, filled with films ever so slightly similar (Coda itself is a remake of French movie La Famille Bélier). Despite the grit of the Massachusetts setting and the earthy way in which Heder chooses to shoot it, Coda firmly takes place in Movie Universe, where a great deal of the action and dialogue isn’t rooted in enough of a recognisable reality for it to have much of an impact. The plot, which contains an inspirational sassy music teacher, a burgeoning young romance, wacky horny parents, a big last act school concert and a big last act singing audition just feels a little too assembled, the end product resembling a generic, low-stakes Netflix teen movie rather than anything of much substance. The differentiating factor, that Ruby’s family is deaf, does create some of the film’s more interesting situations, and gives us brief insight into an intriguing dynamic that’s been mostly unexplored (plus, we get to learn the sign language for “twat waffle”, which feels important). Depictions of deafness on screen are still incredibly rare and Heder (who made the equally sensitive yet far more effective Tallulah in 2016) handles the set-up with care, showing us the frustrations that are felt by both Ruby and her family, how communication can rapidly go from easy to impossible and how home becomes its own community, safe from judgment and misunderstanding. Jones is a winning, confident lead, believably plucky enough to stand up to the fishermen who denigrate and mistreat her family and a strong enough singer to sell her musical subplot. There’s a non-cloying sweetness to her YA romance scenes, helped largely by the decision to have her and crush tasked with a duet of You’re All I Need to Get By (a song that’s nicely used in a climactic scene with Ruby and her father too) and the aforementioned big concert sequence is smartly designed, allowing her parents to understand the effect her voice has on others. Heder takes a few too many abrupt shortcuts with some of her plotting, forgetting some characters and shoving other key moments in a montage, with Ruby’s best friend and mother both introduced with gusto then confusingly sidelined and the rise of her family’s relaunched business happening with confusingly breakneck speed. These problems would perhaps be less distracting if Heder accepted that her film takes place in the realm of fantasy, the kind inhabited by Nicholas Sparks adaptations and Lifetime Christmas movies. But it takes itself a little too seriously for that to be the case, leaving it awkwardly stuck between both worlds, the rules it subscribes to not making sense in the structure of a grounded indie drama. Coda is a mostly likable concoction, but one that’s just too formulaic and ultimately rather calculated to secure the emotional response it so desperately wants by the big finale. A sweet but forgettable start to the festival. Coda is screening at the Sundance film festival with a release date yet to be confirmed	862
At the centre of the agonising drama Mass is a conversation of overwhelming difficulty, the kind that makes you wince to even think about how it might play out. Watching it unfold for almost two hours is then something of an endurance test, an often suffocating experience trapped in a room with four people who don’t want to be there but know that they should, driven by the vain hope that maybe it might chip away at some of the paralysing pain they’re all stuck with. It’s going deeper into the darkness to try to see the light, asking hard questions knowing the answers will be even harder, a grim yet necessary torture chamber. It takes place six years after a devastatingly familiar tragedy: a high school shooting. A room in a church is being prepared for a meeting between two sets of parents arranged by a lawyer and encouraged by a therapist. Both couples lost their sons that day and have been doggedly trying to process their grief ever since. For Jay (Jason Isaacs) and Gail (Martha Plimpton) that’s led them here, sitting down with Richard (Reed Birney) and Linda (Ann Dowd), struggling with their loss too but also their responsibility for it was their son who was the shooter. After an opening stretch slightly marred by an over-mannered turn from Breeda Wool as a nervy woman working at the church the couples are heading to, actor turned first-time writer-director Fran Kranz locks us in with the foursome and doesn’t let us out until they’re through. There’s something admirable in his lack of interest in combatting accusations of staginess, deciding against his characters taking any brief excursions out of his one location (even to the toilet) and refusing to use any form of flashback to visually illustrate the event being discussed. It’s an airless chamber piece, a self-assured gamble that pays off almost instantaneously thanks to the four impeccable performances at its centre, each parent processing, intellectualising and vocalising their anguish in different ways. Their discussion is polite and delicately structured at first, influenced by advice from their respective therapists but soon Jay and Gail’s burn takes over, a desperate, if doomed, desire to know every small detail about the killer, to find some way of placing further blame at his parents’ feet. How could they not have known? What did they not pick up on? What could they have done differently? A lazier script would have turned Birney’s defensive dad into more of an antagonist, a gun nut perhaps (Kranz cleverly glides past political debate early on) or simply someone unwilling to accept the gravity of what his son has done. But what’s so sad and messy about Mass is that everyone here is a victim, including the shooter himself, a bullied boy with undiagnosed mental health issues, and so the breathless charge to find someone to be angry at, to punish, doesn’t lead anywhere; it never will. Jay and Gail were armed, expecting something more fractious perhaps but what they find is yet more sadness, two people who have also lost their son but whose grief will never be validated in the way theirs has been. If it all sounds rather torturous then, yes, at times it is but the speed of Kranz’s dialogue and the quartet’s knotty, no-stone-unturned pathologising make it a gripping watch, bleak but never oppressively so. It’s anchored by four never-better actors, digging into their haunted characters, avoiding histrionics and instead showing us the constancy of grief, always there, always hurting somewhat, rather than one which emerges during a frenzied outburst. Birney, an actor best known for his stage work, and Dowd have the harder roles to pull off but they’re both able to convincingly convey the unfathomable conflict of still loving someone who did something so horrible (Dowd’s final moment in the film, a story she tells about her dead son, is a gut punch). Kranz, bizarrely best known as the stoner in Joss Whedon’s meta-horror The Cabin in the Woods, has crafted an impressively bracing debut devoid of sentimentality, a film of difficult questions that avoids easy answers. Mass may not be a particularly enjoyable experience but it’s a strikingly effective one. Mass is screening at the Sundance film festival with a release date yet to be confirmed	835
The shaggy bromance comedy On the Count of Three explains its title and premise in its stark opening scene. Two best friends have guns trained at each other’s head, agreeing that, yep, on the count of three they’ll shoot, bringing to end two lives that in their eyes haven’t been worth living, an inevitable solution to a bleak problem. Predictably we then rewind to “earlier that morning” to see how the pair found themselves on the precipice of suicide at the back of a strip club. Val (Jerrod Carmichael, also the first-time director) goes from glumly smoking in bed to glumly smoking at work, a life without aim or purpose, one that he sees no point in continuing. Kevin (Christopher Abbott) is no stranger to trying to kill himself, having bounced from therapist to therapist to an institution where he’s currently staying, doggedly attempting to convince his doctor to let him go despite a suicide attempt just three days prior. When Val goes to visit, he decides to break him out, revealing his life-ending master plan, but just as they prepare to fire, Kevin decides that there are a few things they need to do first, taking them on a journey through their youth, tying up loose ends, before they die later that evening. In the space of just 84 minutes, comedian Carmichael, working off a script from Ari Katcher and Ryan Welch, tries to wring humour and pathos from the pair’s manic last day, hitting everything from child molestation to depression to domestic violence with cameos from Henry Winkler, Tiffany Haddish and JB Smoove, a bravely stacked debut that just about avoids toppling over. Like the characters themselves, though, it’s forever on the verge of falling apart, hurtling along at speed with every hit matched by a miss. It’s the unusually wrought friendship and the frank mental health discussions that keep it on track. We’re so accustomed to seeing young men talk around issues of depression that it’s a relief to see two characters facing it head on without shame or embarrassment and the script shows how they exist on opposite ends of the same sad spectrum, dealing with their hopelessness in different ways. Carmichael, more traditionally associated with strictly comic fare such as his well-received sitcom The Carmichael Show, makes a striking debut as a film-maker, opting for unusual visual and music choices throughout and showing confidence with the film’s more ambitious setpieces (a final quarry-based standoff is rather beautiful in scope). He’s not always as well-served by the script, though, which relies a little too heavily on unfunny buddy comedy quarreling, a tactic that starts to grate by the film’s finale. It’s a shame because there are also nice little character details littered throughout – Kevin’s unease with using a gun, as it betrays his political leaning; Val’s effective monologue about the doomed idea that fixing one thing might fix everything; the discussion over how playing on-the-nose songs to match your emotion is corny – that hint at a better, slicker draft of the same story. The pair do their best with the uneven dialogue they’re given and there’s a strong enough chemistry between them to sell the more underwritten elements of their friendship but still, one keeps wondering what could have been with something a little tighter. Abbott in particular is a marvel, a Sundance mainstay at this stage, allowed to play the more fully fleshed of the two, whose childhood of abuse and willfully unhelpful therapy has led to a fractured view on the world and he digs deep to sell even the falsest of moments. With delicate material, the film treads sensitively (Carmichael consulted mental health experts to ensure authenticity) and any fears over something that might glorify or diminish suicide are quickly allayed. While it’s ultimately a little too messy to work quite as well as it could have, given the interesting and ambitious ingredients, On the Count of Three is proof that Carmichael is a director to be excited about, hoping that perhaps he finds time to write his next script himself (although his upcoming slate as a writer – including a 48 Hours remake with the Safdie brothers and a Django Unchained sequel with Quentin Tarantino – suggests he might be a tad busy). It’s a good shot but next time, I’m sure he’ll hit the bullseye.

Georgian writer-director Dea Kulumbegashvili’s fierce feature debut, about a Jehovah’s Witness whose faith is tested, opens with an act of hostility. The camera observes from a fixed point at the back of a Kingdom Hall as the space fills and blinds are eventually drawn. Minutes into the service, someone throws a firebomb into the room. The camera continues to watch as flames start to spread. Beginning centres on Yana (Ia Sukhitashvili), former actress and dutiful wife of congregation leader David (Rati Oneli, who co-wrote the film). Yana must navigate both her domineering husband and Alex (Kakha Kintsurashvili), a dangerous man who insists he is a police detective from Tbilisi. Kulumbegashvili draws parallels between the local contempt for Jehovah’s Witnesses – a religious minority in the Georgian mountain town of Lagodekhi – and a broader patriarchal contempt for women. Sukhitashvili’s subtle performance brings interiority to a character who might otherwise be defined entirely by her suffering. The director favours a static camera and extended takes that give her compositions a holy quality. The length of certain scenes feels confrontational, not unlike Chantal Akerman’s long takes in her 1975 feminist classic Jeanne Dielman, 23, quai du commerce, 1080 Bruxelles. Through this rigorous aesthetic, a distinctive point of view emerges. An act of sexual violence takes place in a setting of natural beauty – a babbling brook flanked by wildflowers. The juxtaposition feels like a provocation. • On Mubi	276
One of the most frustrating yet common subgenres of festival movie is the kind that is assembled with a high level of craftsmanship, a beautifully wrapped present urging us to see what’s inside. But once opened, you find out there is nothing there, a cruel gotcha that disappoints then aggravates, a problem facing the first-time director Pascual Sisto’s underwhelming psychodrama John and the Hole. The script, from the Alejandro González Iñárritu collaborator Nicolás Giacobone, offers up a tantalising set-up. John (Charlie Shotwell) is a dead-eyed 13-year-old living with his wealthy family in a luxurious house surrounded by woodland. After encountering a bunker close-by, John decides to drug his parents (Michael C Hall and Jennifer Ehle) and sister (Taissa Farmiga) and leave them down there. As they scramble for a reason, as well as wait patiently for infrequent food and water deliveries, John carries on with his new life, one without as many rules but with a great deal more responsibilities. The crudest way to describe what transpires in John and the Hole would be Home Alone if re-envisioned by Michael Haneke or perhaps Yorgos Lanthimos in the broadest possible terms, a chilly atmosphere successfully evoked but without any of the thought or intellect that both film-makers would also bring to the table. Sisto and the cinematographer Paul Ozgur have created something visually effective here, from the sleek yet soulless home the camera glides through and around to the menacing woods that surround it, a world we’re eager to explore with more depth, hoping that such distinctive style isn’t just a cover for a lack of substance. In the first act, it’s hard not to be intrigued, an interesting escalation of boundary-pushing as John checks the limits of the world around him and tests what he might be capable of, the things he might be able to do and whether some form of conscience might stop him. There is a great deal of dream logic that is then required for him to drug his family and physically move them all the way down into the bunker, given his age and slight frame, but Giacobone intersperses his script with scenes of a mother telling her daughter a story, clueing us in that everything might not be as it seems. This genuine early creepiness though turns into a fear that actually, Giacobone doesn’t really have much to say or do with his concept, like it was written on the fly, an elevator pitch panicked into production. Teases of something more to grab on to come and go as the story progresses with John inviting a rambunctious friend to the house, both of them as fascinated by a morbid drowning game as they are by the idea of unlimited fast food, before the realities of adulthood start to dawn, a world of promise and agency but also one that’s messier and crueler than what came before. Investment starts to fade as intrigue turns to boredom and as hard as Shotwell might try, he’s given so little to work with that he starts to seem as lost as we feel. By the time we edge toward a third act realisation that is remarkably similar to something Macaulay Culkin figured out in 1990, it’s clear that we’ve been hoodwinked, a disappointment for us and a waste for Ehle and Hall, both better than the material they’re attempting to elevate. As a calling card, Sisto shows an assured hand and one can see him being snapped up to make an “elevated” arthouse horror, an ease with creating unease that will be utilised far more efficiently in the future (although his decision to use a 4:3 aspect ratio never manages to be anything but an inconsequential and frequently overused gimmick). For now, he’s stuck dressing up what is revealed to be nothing much of anything, a hole that’s been diligently dug but remains completely empty.

In what’s proving to be a rather sub-par Sundance (an understandable blip given the unusual nature of this year’s virtual festival), it’s a genuine thrill to encounter a film as exciting and immediate as Flee, a much-needed jolt of energy now reverberating on laptop screens across the country. Even in a traditional year, it’s the kind of audacious and uniquely told story that would have attendees excitedly buzzing around Park City, urging others to seek out, and despite the fractured nature of this year’s edition, a swell of digital support has helped it nab a seven-figure deal with Neon (helped also perhaps by its star producers Riz Ahmed and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), this year’s first big sale, a well-earned reward for what’s likely to be the best film of the festival. The true story at its centre is one that’s tailor-made for some form of cinema, a harrowing and suspenseful refugee narrative of loss and resilience, and director Jonas Poher Rasmussen could have brought it to the screen in many ways, almost all of them more conventionally easier than the one he finally chose. Rasmussen’s friend, known in the film as Amin but whose real identity is being kept confidential, has an untold backstory that he only revealed to him years into their friendship. Amin is an Afghan refugee, now living with his fiance in Denmark, who agrees to share how he made his way from war-torn Kabul in the 80s to now, living a settled, open life as a gay man, one he’d never thought was possible. Whichever form of storytelling had been settled on, the staggering details of Amin’s life would have been undeniable, but in animating his interviews with him and the various events being recalled, Rasmussen finds an unusually immersive way to pull us in even closer, one that’s both emotionally involving and artfully realised. Amin’s childhood, as with many others like him, was interrupted in the late 80s as conflict forced him and his family to escape their home, finding their way to Moscow. The following years are then told in pieces: fearful encounters with corrupt Russian police, desperate attempts to smuggle the family bit by bit to Europe and Amin realising, then hiding his burgeoning sexuality as a gay teen, fearful of the consequences of being open. While Rasmussen animates the majority of the film, there are also interspersed montages of archival footage, deftly informing us of the basics of the political chaos that surrounds Amin’s life in both Afghanistan and Russia. It’s impossible to recall a refugee story told with such devastating efficacy as well as such specific nuance, showing us the horrors Amin experienced but also, importantly, how they stuck to him in the years after and still do. There’s an immense weight he carries, an almost constant fear of being removed, his home being taken away, a sudden yank back to a life of violence and uncertainty. There’s also an unimaginable burden, a feeling that he must always prove his worth, a responsibility to his family to succeed, an obsession with his career that we see causing tensions in his relationship. There are sequences of almost unbearable suspense, as Amin tries to find safety, and infuriating injustice, as traffickers and officials take advantage, but also poignant liberation, as Amin steps into his first gay club, a scene of joyous comfort, the safest haven after so much strife. Amin’s life has involved so much suppression, both as an immigrant and as a gay man, that his identity has become such a confusing construct. His story shifts a few times in the film, as he sifts through what’s real and what he’s had to train himself to believe about himself and his past in order to survive. There’s a natural rhythm and sense of discovery to these recollections, as if he’s working so much of it out for himself still as he talks, the conversations between him and Rasmussen feeling therapeutic rather than exploitative. It’s a nakedly personal film and we feel honoured being allowed in the room with them, albeit in an animated version, intimately observing a story that up until now had been mostly repressed. Flee is a remarkably humanising and complex film, expanding and expounding the kind of story that’s too easily simplified. Rasmussen has created a loving and unsparing tribute to his friend, a brave survivor whose story I’ll find impossible to forget. Flee is screening at the Sundance film festival with a release date later this year	877
In February 2017, at Kuala Lumpur airport, two young women smeared the deadly chemical agent VX across the face of Kim Jong-nam, estranged half-brother of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. He died less than 20 minutes later. CCTV footage of the incident shows one of them wearing a white top emblazoned with the phrase LOL. According to their lawyers, the pair thought they were competing in a YouTube prank show. Perhaps wisely, Ryan White’s slick documentary chooses not to mine the bizarre scene for comic potential. Instead, he spins the arrest of Siti Aisyah and Doan Thi Huong – economic migrants from Indonesia and Vietnam respectively – into a parable about political corruption. • On multiple platforms	132
Former American football star Palmer (Justin Timberlake) has just been released from a 12-year stint in prison. It’s a shock, then, when he ends up having to care for a bullied young boy (Ryder Allen) in this modest family drama. Allen is a little cutesy as Sam, who is obsessed with fairies, dolls and dresses. Still, the film’s treatment of a gender-nonconforming character is clear-eyed. Timberlake can certainly act (see his turn in The Social Network), but the role of hardened, monosyllabic Palmer isn’t a neat fit. The showy singer turned actor struggles to modulate his natural charisma, a flirtatious, extroverted energy repeatedly leaking out where it should be muffled. • On Apple TV	141
This bittersweet tale of the unearthing of the Sutton Hoo treasures on the eve of the second world war has gentle charm to spare. Adapted by screenwriter Moira Buffini from the historical novel by John Preston, it’s a melancholy whimsy about common purpose, new friendship and the persistence of the past, bogged down occasionally by a somewhat superfluous romantic subplot but buoyed up by Mike Eley’s lush cinematography, which beautifully captures the lonely beauty of the open English landscapes. Ralph Fiennes is Basil Brown, the self-taught, working-class archaeologist who wears his immense learning lightly, and who rides his panniered bike under imposing skies, now darkening with the impending threat of war with Germany. Basil’s demeanour is quiet and unassuming, but there’s a steely defiance beneath the surface deference, an awareness of his own worth, both professionally and financially. By contrast, Carey Mulligan’s Edith Pretty is a wealthy widow whose extensive land includes a series of imposing earth mounds, which she enlists Brown to excavate. “My interest in archaeology began like yours,” Edith tells the initially sceptical Basil, “when I was scarcely old enough to hold a trowel.” So begins an unlikely friendship between two very different people, both of whom believe that “it speaks, the past”. In a film defined by understatement, it’s the little details that matter. There’s an admirable eloquence to Fiennes’s portrayal of Brown, from the studied precision of his very specific Suffolk accent to the way his gaze alters as he looks from the sod to the stars, finding equal time-travelling wonder in both worlds. Plaudits, too, to Monica Dolan, who makes the most of a supporting role as Basil’s wife, May, breathing years of history into a few fairly short exchanges, telling us more about their life together in a fleeting glance or a tentative touch than any amount of expository dialogue. Meanwhile, the redoubtable Ken Stott takes a broadly written caricature of academic archaeologist Charles Phillips and keeps it just the right side of credible, personifying the snobby establishment who march in to take credit for Basil’s discoveries, looking down their noses at Brown whom they consider to be little more than a labourer – an earth mover. In a recent interview, Fiennes described Buffini’s script as “a story of kindred spirits” that is “not clouded by love or romance”. That’s an accurate description, despite a distant echo of the repressed longings that underpinned Merchant Ivory’s adaptation of Kazuo Ishiguro’s The Remains of the Day. A shame, then, that The Dig gets sidetracked by a subplot that sees Lily James’s real-life archaeologist Peggy Piggott falling for Johnny Flynn’s fictional airman Rory Lomax, a distraction that feels as though it has been foregrounded simply to broaden the film’s appeal to younger audiences, rather than as an organic addendum to the central story. Altogether more integral is Basil’s increasingly paternal relationship with Edith’s son, Robert (Archie Barnes), the young boy finding solace from the distressing realisation of his mother’s ailing health in the company of someone who has a touch of eternity about him. Through Basil, Robert sees a world in which the past is never lost, a theme that chimes with the undercurrents of mortality and living legacy playing out in the present. Director Simon Stone may have learned his craft in the theatre, but his second feature (after 2015’s feted Australian drama The Daughter) has a rich cinematic glow that reminded me of Jessica Swale’s lovely Summerland, another affectionately nostalgic Brit pic with its feet on the ground and its head in the heavens.

The GameStop content race is on, even as the Reddit-fueled market rebellion against billionaire hedge funds continues to play out in real time. Netflix is reportedly in talks to ink a film adaptation of the social media David v Goliath saga, in which a small army of online investors upended Wall Street by driving up the prices of shares in the ailing video game chain and other shorted companies, with Mark Boal (Zero Dark Thirty, The Hurt Locker) set to write and To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before’s Noah Centineo attached to star. The as-yet-untitled project would be the second adaptation of the merely two-weeks-old GameStop saga already in development, after MGM acquired rights in a bidding war last week to the book proposal The Antisocial Network by Ben Mezrich, the author of The Accidental Billionaires, which served as source material for The Social Network. That adaptation is set to be produced by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, both played by Armie Hammer in David Fincher’s drama. An auction for the book itself will begin this month. According to Deadline, which broke the news, sources claim the Netflix project would use the recent market frenzy, in which a motley crew of Reddit users and amateur investors targeted billionaire hedge funds’ short-selling bets and sent GameStop stocks surging 135% on a single day, to explore the broader cultural shifts, for good and ill, as social media has leveled the playing field and overruled former gatekeepers. The film will reportedly cover the GameStop saga as well as the proliferation of misinformation on social media and intentionally disseminated disinformation on election fraud, which propelled the pro-Trump assault on the US Capitol earlier this month. This is not the first time Boal has incorporated real-time developments into a fast-track screenplay; following the news that US Navy Seals had killed Osama bin Laden in a 2011 raid in Pakistan, Boal and his directing partner, Kathryn Bigelow, quickly adapted a long-gestating project on the hunt for the al-Qaida leader into Zero Dark Thirty, a thriller on controversial US intelligence techniques and the successful raid.	386
This awkward British feelgood cancer comedy by director Victor Buhler never entirely comes together, switching from serious to silly and not exactly comfortable in either tone or register. What Running Naked has got going for it are two likable supporting performances by Samuel Bottomley and James Senneck as Mark and Ben, teenage cancer patients who meet in a Manchester hospital. Bored and terrified, they make mischief on the wards. (There’s a funny scene in which they make a break for it, reaching as far as the carpark before realising there’s nowhere to go, and skulk back to their beds.) Skip ahead 15 years, and the film is on shakier ground. Now in their 30s, Mark and Ben (played by Matthew McNulty and Andrew Gower, respectively) survived but live with an increased risk of developing cancer as adults. Mark is a doctor on the same ward where the pair were treated as lads. He’s the more successful of the two, but is held back emotionally by a nagging fear that bad things happen to him. So he laddishly dumps the love of his life, fellow doctor Jade (Rakhee Thakrar), before anything goes wrong with the relationship. Still, he’s loyal to his old mate Ben. Grownup Ben is more problematic. He’s dweeby, anaemic-looking and wears a terrible cardboard-coloured suit – imagine Jarvis Cocker playing Mr Bean. Since remission he has suffered from hygiene-related obsessive behaviours, and there is something questionable in the way his struggles get played for laughs. The script here is unkind and unfunny, and perhaps actually backfires, since many of us can now relate to applying hand sanitiser every five minutes. The plot hinges on a twist you can see coming for miles; this is one of those Britfilms with a sitcom feel. It might have worked better over four or five episodes with sharpening of the script – and more teenage pranks. • Available from 8 February on digital formats.	372
Edgar Wright’s films have always been palpably clever, energetic and they revel in existing outside of clear genre lines. It’s a natural fit, then, that his first documentary would focus on the art pop duo Sparks, a palpably clever and energetic band who revel in existing outside clear genre lines. Those who know and love Sparks should prepare for 135 minutes of archival ecstasy, as Wright’s The Sparks Brothers is a beat-by-beat close read of Ron and Russell Mael’s career from their late 1960s college experiments to today. Newcomers to this beloved cult group, which is certainly most people, especially in the United States, will find that Wright’s technique swiftly knocks down the barriers of entry with 50 years of material. The reason why some people are absolutely in love with Sparks is that Sparks are fun, and you just have to hear it and see it to get it. Ron, 75, and Russell, 73, were born in the Los Angeles area, even though they’ve been mistaken for British for most of their careers. Their father, who was an artist and illustrator, died when they were young, and their doting mother was cool enough to take them to see the Beatles twice. As they got interested in music Ron, the thinner and perhaps weirder one, wrote most of the tunes. He plays keyboards and for years sported what was either a Charlie Chaplin or Adolf Hitler mustache, depending on how you wanted to read it. Russell had more typical rock god looks, and their first albums differentiated themselves with rich, humorous lyrics and instantly catchy melodies. They sounded a bit like the Kinks and Roxy Music, and soon found more success in the UK than back home. There was also an element of camp to their whole career – “are they kidding with this?” is a question that hangs over so much of their best work. The single This Town Ain’t Big Enough for the Both of Us from the 1974 album Kimono My House nearly out-Queens Queen with its operatic bombast. Their Top of the Pops debut was one of those life-changing television broadcasts for people looking for unconventional music acts. But whenever they got into a groove, whether it connected with audiences or not, they were driven to change direction. Their vaudevillian pop with producer Todd Rundgren turned to a grander, studio-symphony sound with producer Tony Visconti. As the punk and No Wave scene was happening they relocated to New York, then ditched that to collaborate with Giorgio Moroder for 1979’s No 1 in Heaven, one of the first all-synthesizer pop-rock albums. Later albums grew even more difficult to describe. Some had a minor hit or two, others went straight into obscurity. But their frugal living and determination prevented them from ever retiring as the legend just grew. Edgar Wright’s movie is more than just a typical portrait of artists. While the structure is quite rigid (all 25 Sparks albums get their bullet point) the formality allows Wright and the Maels to color outside the lines. The Sparks Brothers employs stop motion and 2D animation, re-enactment video, cheeky “lower third” graphics, props and even moving cameras during talking head videos. Wright knows some people won’t want to watch a long documentary about a band they’ve never heard of, so he’s sure to keep it funny and alive at every possible turn. With Sparks being “musicians’ musicians” there’s no shortage of luminaries eager to sing their praises. (Beck, Flea, “Weird Al” Yankovic and Jonathan Ross are just the tip of the iceberg here.) What’s strange, though, is that the film seems a little uneasy about getting to know the Maels beyond their personas. Part of their whole mystique is how mercurial they are, but Wright seems, at the beginning, to announce that we’ll finally get to know these guys. One of the first questions seems the most personal: whether they are gay or straight. (They are straight.) But other than a small period in time when Russell dated Jane Wiedlin of the Go-Go’s, we don’t hear a thing about other relationships. It is also baffling that not once in this movie is it mentioned that the Maels are Jewish. They were born just years after the Holocaust to parents named Meyer and Miriam, and have steadily devoted their lives to being outsider artists. For year’s Ron was described as “that Hitler guy”. You’d think at some point during this extremely in-depth documentary the topic would come up. But we do watch the pair work at a humble home studio, learn Russell’s coffee order and see Ron’s snow globe collection. This is a film that loves its subjects and only someone with a biological revulsion to catchy pop or grand rock theatrics will dislike the film. For most, Sparks is uncharted territory. Luckily there’s a lot to explore. The Sparks Brothers is screening at the Sundance film festival with a release date to be announced	971
There is some interesting material in Clementine, but it is an indulgent mood piece, unfocused and unfinished, and one that feels like an idea for a short film, but stretched out to feature length. Otmara Marrero plays Karen, a woman deeply hurt at being dumped by her older, wealthier lover D (Sonya Walger), who has moreover kept Karen’s beloved dog, Ramsey. In an angry, confused and vengeful mood, Karen drives to D’s beautiful lake house, where they had spent so much blissful time together, and breaks in – just to hang out, or somehow to assert herself. But here she encounters Lana (Sydney Sweeney), a disconcertingly smart, beautiful woman sunbathing by the lake, and a weirdly intense relationship develops between the two of them. Exasperatingly, we are asked to stay tuned for long periods of time while the sexual tension between Karen and Lana smoulders inconclusively away, but then the dramatic focus lurches over to Beau (Will Brittain), a hunky guy who has come to do odd jobs around the lake house, but may be spying on Karen on D’s behalf, and may have designs on Lana. Then he, too, is upstaged in the toxic male sexual danger department by some creepy guys Lana knows, claiming to have contacts in the LA movie business. They have a video camera at their place and give innocent Lana an “audition”. Afterwards, this is the subject of an actor-ish monologue by Lana, which itself feels like an audition piece. (It certainly should go on Sydney Sweeney’s showreel.) Where are we going with all this? Nowhere very satisfying: there is a lot of non-suspense leading to non-thrills and non-revelation of character. The performancesby Marrero and Sweeney, though, are perfectly fair. • Released on digital formats on 8 February.	354
Winter Flies’ two teen runaways, as they make a break across country in their hot-wired Audi, are prone to spontaneously breaking out in incredulous laughter; that’s the guiding spirit of this unforced, inquisitive and winningly optimistic Czech road movie. There’s a hint of unspecified family troubles in their rear-view mirror, but the underage drivers – blasé loverman Mará (Tomáš Mrvík) and rotund Heduš (Jan František Uher) – are more focused on heading anywhere-but-here. Recounted in cross-cut flashback from the police station where Mará is being interrogated on his own (with Heduš’s fate unknown), the duo use the journey time to trade their obsessions: joining the Foreign Legion, sleeping-bag protocol, Mará’s supposed military hotshot granddad and, of course, getting laid. These kind of semi-delusional adolescent hobbyhorses could have ended up as a Superbad-style gag-fest, but Slovenian director Olmo Omerzu patiently teases out a subtler humour and pathos. Nuzzling tightly to the actors’ perspective, Omerzu in his third feature comes close to the kind of miraculous naturalness Hirokazu Kore-eda achieves in his films. Mará proves to have a tender centre, something first relayed when he saves a dog from drowning. There’s an initial suggestion that he may be an unreliable narrator, and Mrvík, pink-cheeked but with a testy gaze, holds the screen with star conviction. But the film finally has no heart for any guile and remains beautifully sincere. In one sequence, Mará falls asleep at the wheel, and the car appears to be driving itself down a snow-streaked Czech highway, as if on the momentum of insolent bravado and the innocence of dreams. • Available from 29 January via YourScreen. • This article was amended on 8 February 2021 to correct the main image credit information.	334
You might not be in the mood for an apocalyptic disaster movie right now, especially one where the best-case scenario is a long stay in an underground bunker, but here’s Greenland, in which Gerard Butler takes a break from saving endangered presidents to save his family. As a comet brings extinction-level mayhem to the planet, Butler is informed he has been selected for a space in the bunker since he’s a structural engineer – a useful trade, post-apocalypse. So he loads up wife and son in the car and says: “So long, suckers!” to his distraught neighbours, and all those other unskilled Americans rioting and dodging comet chunks in the streets. Disaster movies are a little like slasher movies: half the fun is seeing who survives and whether they deserve it. The other half is the epic destruction, which the mid-budget Greenland dials down. That leaves us rooting for a privileged, self-interested family who have already got their golden ticket. Things don’t pan out entirely smoothly for them, but do they really deserve our sympathies? Shouldn’t disaster-movie survival operate on some kind of karmic reward system for moral virtue or selfless heroism? The brave medic, the scientist who predicted all this, the spineless coward who finds their inner steel – that sort of thing. Or at best, it’s random luck. Even in heavily rewatched pandemic thriller Contagion, the life-saving vaccine is distributed by birth-date lottery. In the real world, poorer countries are still waiting for their share of the Covid vaccine. Perhaps the old rules no longer apply. Greenland brings to mind 2012’s The Impossible, which chose to portray the real-life Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004 through the experience of Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts and their separated family rather than, say, the hundreds of thousands of Asian people who died around them. Accomplished though the film-making was, the focus on the plight of some privileged foreign tourists was at best sympathy-challenging, if not downright insulting. James Cameron took a blunter approach with Titanic, conveying the reality that first-class passengers had a much higher chance of getting into the lifeboats – even the evil ones, such as Billy Zane. Leonardo DiCaprio’s Jack had heroism, artistic talent and a twinkle in the eye, but Kate Winslet’s Rose had poshness, so she survived. In a genuine apocalypse we know who the real survivors would be: it would be prepper weirdos like John Goodman in 10 Cloverfield Lane, the gun-toting cannibals of The Road, Mad Max’s wasteland warriors. It will be survival of the most violent. If there’s any justice, when the privileged survivors of Greenland emerge from their bunkers, that’s what will be waiting for them in the sequel.	524
Some may regard the use of a line like “We’re in his mouth!” as an indicator of a film’s less than stellar quality. The sort of on-the-nose dialogue, they would say, that should be nowhere near the final cut. The fact the same line is immediately repeated for wholly unnecessary added emphasis, considering it comes from a character quite obviously in the jaws of 300ft radioactive reptile, is, to those same joyless people, an even more egregious indictment. To me, however, it’s exactly this kind of silliness that makes the 1998 Roland Emmerich film Godzilla, much better than almost everyone would have you believe. What the scathing critics at the time – who variously described it as “idiotic” and “overblown” – failed to understand was that it is clearly not supposed to be taken very seriously at all. We’re talking about a lizard the size of a skyscraper battling it out with Matthew Broderick and Jean Reno. You’d be quite disappointed if it wasn’t at least a little bit idiotic and overblown. Incredibly, one critic even complained about the “inaccurate science and basic implausibility”, which is a bit like complaining about the wetness of water. Criticism like that never seems to take into account the fact the film-makers might actually be intelligent people too, who know exactly what they’re doing. The mouth line and cartoonish scenes like the one where Dr Niko Tatopoulos (played by Broderick) emerges from an elevator to find some murderous baby godzillas munching on popcorn before wryly muttering “wrong floor”, aren’t there by accident. They are funny, very deliberate, winks to the audience that the makers know just as well as you do how ridiculous the whole enterprise is and a green light to sit back, not think too much and enjoy the ride. And helicopters chasing a giant monster around the skyscraper gorges of New York is some ride. Emmerich has even said himself that he never took the original Godzilla films seriously stating “they were just the weekend matinees you saw as a kid, like Hercules films and the really bad Italian westerns. You’d go with all your friends and just laugh.” If you view the film the way the director himself seems to, then Godzilla is uncomplicated entertainment of the best kind. Mindless isn’t always an insult. The plot, such as it is, sees the biologist and radioactive worm enthusiast Dr Niko Tatopoulos drafted by some important-looking government guys on to a taskforce hoping to work out what in the hell could have made some giant footprints in Panama. His expertise and unique insight prove priceless as he shrewdly observes that the city-block sized animal “is much too big to be some kind of lost dinosaur”. For some reason they continue to keep him around, which is just as well because after the beast makes a dramatic landfall in New York, he discovers that it is nesting in Madison Square Garden. And worse than that, it’s gone and laid 200 Volkswagen coupe-sized eggs that are seconds away from hatching. There are some subplots involving the French secret service, a long-lost college girlfriend and a sleazy news anchor but much more important than a trifling thing like the plot for a film like Godzilla, is how it makes you feel. Simply put, it makes you feel like a stupidly excited 11-year-old. It’s basic but there is just something about really big animals, mythical and real, that thrills like nothing else. It must be some deep atavistic fear that films like this, or indeed the diplodocus in the Natural History Museum, tap into. The scene in the film where Godzilla scares some fisher witless as it approaches a New York pier obscured by a wall of water does this magnificently. A tsunami hiding a monster. It’s a classic Emmerich moment and brings to mind the first appearance of the alien spaceships emerging through ominous rolling clouds in Independence Day. Emmerich is the master of that spine-tingling transition from everyday life to end of days that keeps people flocking back to his disaster movies by the millions. Godzilla is too long, the characters are sketchy at best, Broderick is weirdly miscast and at times it feels like the script never got past the first draft. But it’s exactly this recklessly slapdash energy that makes it so entertaining to watch. It hasn’t been polished to within an inch of its life and there is something very likable about that. Perfect films, like nutritious food, are great but sometimes all you want is a cheeseburger. Godzilla is a whopper. Godzilla is available to stream on Starz in the US and Netflix in the UK	889
John Travolta stars in this ridiculous and mostly boring hardboiled thriller (AKA The Poison Rose), playing a private detective investigating the disappearance of a woman from a psychiatric hospital. The web of interlinked crimes he unravels barely makes any sense and there are some epically pointless plot twists – one left me so baffled that I wondered if I might’ve momentarily nodded off and missed a scene. It’s a film with no energy, not much pace and few signs of life. It’s exhausting to watch. Travolta goes beyond “world-weary” to give an almost vegetative performance as Carson Phillips, a PI in the poker-playing, bourbon-drinking tradition. In his youth, Phillips was the star quarterback on the local football team but skipped town after a scandal. Back in Texas for the first time in a couple of decades, he gets short shrift at the hospital where the patient has vanished. The doctor in charge (Brendan Fraser) shiftily evades his inquiries and the nurses shoot each other alarmed looks. Morgan Freeman plays casino owner Doc, the richest man in town and clearly not to be trusted. (Like everyone else here, Freeman puts his feet up, taking a breather from doing decent acting.) Wouldn’t you know, it turns out the town is riddled with crime, corrupt to the core. Phillips repeatedly drawls on the voiceover that he’s a sucker for a beautiful woman with a sob story – so inevitably one of the dead bodies is linked to his teenage sweetheart whose daughter (played by the actor’s daughter Ella Bleu Travolta) is accused of murder. It’s a preposterous plot, with a damp-squib ending, and like an episode of Dallas, the dialogue gets phonier and phonier. “This is a bad place. Far worse than you can imagine.” Ditto the film. • Released on 5 February on Amazon Prime Video.	360
Here is an earnestly intended psychological drama about Mary Shelley, and her relationship with Percy Bysshe Shelley, Byron, Polidori and Claire Clairmont during that legendary summer in 1816 on Lake Geneva when Byron challenged everyone to write a ghost story – and Mary conceived of Frankenstein, so commercially outpacing the literary alpha males and anticipating the modern world in ways far beyond them. The film’s drama centres on the trauma of her pregnancy and childbirth, yoking together the ideas of her dark imagination with pre- and postpartum depression, as well as the patriarchal male-author myth – Percy is shown being threatened by Mary’s creativity and sensuality. It is an idealistic and heartfelt film, but also precious and self-conscious with some pretty callow performances, like a student production at the Edinburgh fringe. What it also appears sometimes to be doing is making a play for some old-fashioned horror scares, in honour of Mary Shelley’s enduring creation, with periodic hallucinatory flashes of Mary (Alix Wilton Regan) looking as she perhaps imagines herself to be – gaunt and monstrous and demonic, approaching a kind of emotional breakdown. But the film can’t quite make up its mind if it wants us to surrender to out-and-out genre thrills, or if we should be taking a step back and responding on a loftier literary-historical level, considering the sexual politics that lay behind the production and consumption of the Frankenstein myth. Philippe Bowgen is a ridiculous and roistering Byron, often shown with his shirt half-off, sensuous, anarchically laughing and wine-quaffing, while Giullian Yao Gioiello is a blandly unsympathetic Percy Shelley. It’s a dry and somewhat lifeless tableau. • Released on 4 February on Shudder.	314
Two-thirds of the way into this experimental Greek docu-fiction, one of the wandering souls featured – apparently watching footage from the film – loses his rag. “This is not about birds. It’s about us being crazy as loons. Come on Babis, I’m a customer here, too, I need to understand.” With director Babis Makridis showing all the confrontational strangeness of the Greek new wave here, the exasperation is understandable. What Makridis has cobbled together is a poetic and initially utopian manifesto for self-liberation inspired by Aristophanes’ play The Birds, in which a king transforms into a hoopoe. In nine chapters with titles such as “Find your voice” and “Take off, land”, Makridis quizzes the characters in poker-faced interview setups about their hopes of becoming birds, and observes these avian wannabes as they make strange fluttering calls on urban streets and roam stark landscapes in search of their inspiration, “Mr Hoopoe” – all intercut with performance excerpts from Aristophanes. The precise significance of all this remains up in the clouds with the aerobatic planes he marvels at; although the assemblage starts to drum up an almost shamanistic mania as people perfect their bespoke bird caws and incant against a lightning-blasted cityscape. Perhaps the lack of easy graspability is trying to jar us into a similar consciousness shift, to get modern society soaring above its current disillusionment. Whether this utopia is psychological or social, it quickly recedes; the mood darkens. Makridis takes us to a grillhouse to illustrate lines from Aristophanes about the indignities visited on birds. “Then they stuff their entire hands into your innards, and they tear out your heart, your spleen and your little liver.” Someone rants about avian aspirations offending the gods. By this point, Makridis’s melding of his elements has become a bit lumpen, and his own self-referential cameo in the film after a cast member complains – breaking the generally forthright mood – seems almost an admission he is losing control of his message. This metamorphosis is only semi-achieved. • Birds (Or How to Be One) is on Mubi from 8 February.	397
Sensory overload and incoherence are sadly the dominant qualities of this idealistic crowdsourced YouTube video project from director Kevin Macdonald and executive producer Ridley Scott, which is about everything and nothing. It is a follow-up to Macdonald’s Life in a Day movie from 2011, in which legions of people responded to a request to send in homemade videos on what they were doing on a certain day in 2010: a time-capsule snapshot mosaic from all over the world. This time he and Scott put out a worldwide call for people to record all the various sad, funny, passionate or banal things they were doing on 25 July 2020; he got 324,000 videos from 192 countries. Macdonald has edited all this down to an 87-minute presentation, which he has modified here and there with background music; some videos are broken up into micro-episodes and spread out over the collection, building in one case to a poignant twist ending. A decade on from the first film, smartphones with higher-quality cameras have probably resulted in a technically more sophisticated haul; people have better equipment and are arguably more savvy about curating their content. More people are sending in drone footage with impressive high-def 4K images. There are vehemently presented slices of life, with fierce comments on the Covid pandemic, racism, the climate crisis, poverty and inequality. Yet mulching all these themes together has the effect of giving equal weight to all the video molecules. It makes for a bland coleslaw of user-generated content, however startling and even remarkable the individual strands are. Exasperatingly, we are mostly not told where exactly they were filmed and the context-free mood makes it feel like a gigantic we-are-the-world corporate ad for life insurance. There are some absorbing vignettes. A man proposes to his girlfriend in a beauty spot but is rejected; a Japanese woman tells her boyfriend (who is doing the filming) that she believes their relationship is doomed, and begins to cry. Some of the videos don’t earn their keep on any level. A train-spotter kid makes it his business to film seven types of train on a single day in Illinois … that’s niche, to put it mildly. But I enjoyed the bored guy in lockdown who had given names to all the spiders in his apartment. Easily the strongest moment is when a mother reveals that the adored teenage son who appeared in the first Life in a Day film has died of Covid. Macdonald may well have considered, if only for a second, making this film a complete follow-up for every single one of the people in that original, but discarded it as too close to Michael Apted’s Up series. And yet that mother’s testimony was powerful not merely in what it revealed but in its structural form. It had the compelling quality of narrative: that was then, this is now. The rest of this film is almost entirely formless. However moved or touched you may be by any particular moment, it is disconcerting to have that moment replaced by something completely different – tragic followed by quirky, funny followed by bleak – so you can’t process or understand the emotion. This is a high-minded project conceived on an ambitious scale. But, for me, in the end there was an image satiety that was unrewarding. Life in a Day 2020 is screening at the Sundance film festival on 1 February, then available on YouTube from 6 February.	642
Do we need a defensive ring of steel petticoats erected around Jane Austen’s novels – something, anything to stop them being updated into perky formulaic romcoms like this? Modern Persuasion is, to state the obvious, a modern version of Austen’s last (and arguably best) novel Persuasion: the story of Anne Elliot, who at 27 – still a mere slip of a girl – is staring down the barrel of spinsterdom. Eight years earlier she made the terrible mistake of turning down an offer of marriage from a penniless naval officer. The film-makers have meticulously transferred the book’s characters and plotting – and, to be fair, some of its warmth – to modern-day New York. But lost in adaptation is any trace of Austen’s wit and razor-sharp satire. That said, Alicia Witt brings several shreds of dignity to the role of single gal Wren Cosgrove, a highly-flying PR exec living in New York with her cat. The boyfriend she never got over is her college ex Owen (Shane McRae, performing with the charisma of a wardrobe). After graduation, Wren refused to move to San Francisco with him. Now he’s a tech billionaire; though pointedly not a douchebag since his new project is a charity-giving app. When the pair accidentally meet up again – after he hires her firm to do his PR – Owen acts frostily like they’re strangers. Instead he flirts with Wren’s two young assistants (nicely played as irritating yet endearing by Daniella Pineda and Tedra Millan). Here the script misses a trick; it could have mimicked Austen, skewering the social hypocrisy of men marrying younger women while women of the same age are deemed to be mothballed – plus ça change. But instead the film mostly satirises the assistants’ aggressively millennial social media abbreviations – impenetrable to the oldies. Still, the biggest crime against Austen, and the film’s fundamental flaw, is turning woman-of-substance Anne Elliot into yet another romcom thirtysomething cat lady sighing dreamily at the Manhattan skyline while waiting for Mr Right. • Modern Persuasion is on digital platforms from 8 February.	400
This year’s Golden Globes will be the first film awards season event to unfold in the grim and globally buzzkilled new world of Covid restrictions, but some traditions are sacrosanct: the world of snubs. Christopher Nolan’s colossal metaphysical thriller Tenet was lauded by many in the business, but was sent away almost empty-handed in nominations (one nod for Ludwig Göransson’s score). It is also disappointing that the overwhelmingly moving and mysterious Pixar animation Soul gets only two nominations – animation and score. Surely it deserved best film musical or comedy? In terms of diversity, the Globes have not disgraced themselves, with three out of the five director nominees being women: Emerald Fennell for the brilliant rape-revenge satire Promising Young Woman, Regina King for the true-life 60s encounter One Night in Miami and Chloé Zhao for the docudrama Nomadland – although some will be disappointed to see the relative failure in the best film categories of the big black-ensemble pictures such as One Night in Miami, Spike Lee’s Da 5 Bloods and Shaka King’s Judas and the Black Messiah. Of course, the streaming giants are crowding out the rest. Netflix has 22 film nominations in total, way ahead of the next contender Amazon Studios, with seven. Disney must content itself with joint third place with a mere five. As far as frontrunner movies go, I have a hunch that it is Nomadland that will wind up with the bragging rights, and with its nominations for drama, director and actress (Frances McDormand) might very well be in tune with this year’s sombre and ruminative zeitgeist. It is not about Covid but rather the social consequences of the 2008 financial crash, with sixtysomethings and newly penniless retirees forced to move into Winnebagos and roam around the country looking for seasonal work in giant Amazon warehouses and the like. It is a wonderful film, that speaks to a new thoughtfulness in the air. In the nominations tally, Nomadland with four nods is outclassed by David Fincher’s Mank, the league leader with six. This is the dreamlike alt-reality riff on Herman J Mankiewicz (charismatically played by Gary Oldman), the screenwriter who, after a career of what he felt was tinseltown hackwork, found himself sharing the screenplay Oscar with Orson Welles for Citizen Kane. (The movie was scripted by Fincher’s late father Jack, who gets a posthumous screenplay nomination.) The film mischievously amplifies the famous or notorious dissident theory advanced by Pauline Kael that Mankiewicz was Kane’s true driving force – which some have found intolerable and others fascinating. I am in the latter category. Florian Zeller’s The Father also has four nominations, with Anthony Hopkins as the ageing dementia sufferer and Olivia Colman as his daughter; it has devastated all who have seen who have seen it. This too is a serious and heartfelt film with overwhelmingly disturbing and moving sequences from the point of view of the person with dementia, and may also be a Globe winner that addresses our sober new mood. Fennell is a brilliant young film-maker who has scored a dazzling triumph with her debut movie Promising Young Woman, the rape-revenge suspense satire starring Carey Mulligan as a mysterious avenger faking falling-down drunkenness in clubs, so that predatory men can take her back to their place where she has a surprise in store for them. It has nods in director, drama, actress and screenplay. But my feeling is that this is the year for Nomadland and The Father.	655
This South African-made action-drama unfolds against the background of a conflict little known about above the equator, much less used as a setting for film – the Namibian war of independence from 1966-90, AKA the South African border war. Often considered South Africa’s version of Vietnam, it was, among other things, a proxy fight between South Africa, then still under apartheid, and its allies at the time, and the People’s Liberation Army of Namibia, who were backed by the Soviet Union and Cuba. Although there’s a fair amount of on-screen contextualising in the opening minutes to explain key terms and ideas, The Recce feels made for a local audience that has a grasp of the cultural and historical background. That means it’s not easy for outsiders to read the ideology of this stylised, fictional account of an elite Afrikaner soldier, Henk Viljoen (Greg Kriek), the “recce”, who is ordered to go across enemy lines alone one last time to kill a Russian officer. Henk leaves behind his pregnant wife Nicola (Christia Visser), with whom we spend a lot of screen time as she looks anxious, remembers happier moments in her marriage and visits Henk’s parents, who are sick with worry about their son. In the narrative mix is Captain Le Roux (Grant Swanby), an English-speaking South African officer who is also worried about Henk and the general madness of the war. All three have internal monologues where we hear their poetic musings as the visuals show slow-motion action, often backlit with the blazing African sun, or drinking in the vast, awe-inspiring landscape. I’m guessing writer-director Johannes Ferdinand Van Zyl has been huffing Terrence Malick movies, particularly the ones about sensitive manly types, such as The Thin Red Line and The Tree of Life. At any moment you expect Kriek to do a magical backflip in slo-mo as the soundtracks keens mournfully and magic hour breaks across the bush. The characters of colour, such as the many indigenous people Henk shoots on his way in and out of Angola, don’t get to share their thoughts in dreamy voiceovers, which smacks more of oversight rather than overt racism. Nevertheless, the end result feels limited and ultimately a little pointless. • The Recce is available on digital platforms from 8 February.	439

The French-Swiss actor Laetitia Dosch lavishes all her underappreciated star quality on this insouciantly explicit movie about amour fou and erotic obsession, adapted by the director Danielle Arbid from the 1991 novel by Annie Ernaux. Dosch plays Hélène, a university lecturer in Paris, divorced with a young son, who has fallen passionately in love with an icily sexy, dead-eyed and tattooed young Russian diplomat called Alexandre, played by Ukrainian-born ballet star Sergei Polunin. When he is not driving too fast while buzzing from Scotch in his top-of-the-range Audi and giving Hélène top-of-the-range orgasms, Alexandre has a habit of not returning her pitifully submissive voicemails. He casually leaves her waiting in the midday hotel room where they’d agreed to meet in all her brand new La Perla lingerie, while he disappears back to Moscow to spend quality time with his wife. Dosch brings a wonderful humanity and sensitivity to the role, and the movie begins with a sensational closeup on her face as she wonderingly recounts to an unseen person how and when (though not exactly why) the affair began and how by fanatically recalling the details she feels she might somehow bring the affair back to life in the present. With her tremulous secret half-smile, she seems always on the verge of laughing dismissively or bursting into tears. It’s a shame that Dosch’s character could not have been given a less cliched job (interspersing sex scenes with coolly cerebral lectures about Baudelaire, Aphra Behn etc), and a shame that she could not have been cast opposite a better actor, or – dare I say it? – an actual actor. But of course it is Polunin’s very reptilian unresponsiveness which makes him mysterious and attractive. (The Vladimir Putin tattoo which Polunin famously had inked on his chest has been covered by makeup for this film.) Hélène is functioning reasonably well while this madly destructive affair carries on. She takes her young son Paul (Lou-Teymour Thion) to school and home again, and just about manages to fix his meals, though always in an agreeable state of post-coital dishevelment and reverie after long bouts of illicit daytime sex. (Is there any other kind?) Occasionally, she will go out for a movie with her sane, humorous friend Anita (Caroline Ducey); they go to see Hiroshima Mon Amour and Hélène marvels at the way Emmanuelle Riva gets to be imploringly addressed by her suitor. Simple Passion is very funny on the way poor Hélène will suddenly turn off her hairdryer, fearing that she might not be able to hear her phone, and I laughed when she takes a weekend break in Florence and finds herself gazing at the buttocks of the replica David statue in the Piazza della Signoria. Yes – there is a certain resemblance to Polunin’s buttocks. It is also excellent on the overwhelming and devastating sense of loss both after and during an affair: those dead stretches when Hélène has to wonder, yet again, if it is all over; she is in denial about the awful truth that if you have to wonder … then, yes, it is all over. Hers is the agony of not knowing whether simply to surrender yourself utterly to that loss. There is also a great sequence when Hèlène – stunned into a state of shock when the end does appear to have come – takes a ride on a train and finds herself looking at the faces of all the placid, evidently unlovelorn people with her. She is crushed by the pure, unbearable irrelevance of everything that is not Alexandre. It is a pity that Polunin could not have been a little relaxed in the role: but, as I say, his opaque hauteur is rather the point. And Dosch is great. • Released on 5 February on Curzon Home Cinema.	710
There is some epically bad acting in this silly and tiresome sci-fi fantasy-mystery from writer-director Mike Cahill, whose renowned debut Another Earth in 2011 left me sceptical, yet intrigued. But this is a conceited mess, which almost from the very first frame tips you off that we are heading for some version of the time-honoured cheat/twist ending that has – admittedly – been with cinema since its earliest days and attracted some of the biggest directorial names. Owen Wilson plays Greg, a stressed and ill-looking guy who is working in a call centre firm called Technical Difficulties, the job being to help people on the phone with their problems. He has a corner office, so is presumably a big cheese. But Greg is slacking off, more concerned with doodling some dream city of his own imagination. He also has a strained relationship with his grownup daughter Emily (Nesta Cooper), who is about to graduate from college. Greg is estranged from Emily’s mother and talks about having “messed up”. But after a calamitous confrontation with his boss, he winds up in a scuzzy bar where he meets a Manic Pixie Grownup Tramp Woman called Isabel, played with unbearably peculiar mannerisms by Salma Hayek. Isabel red-pills Greg about the false nature of the universe: it’s all a digitally created illusion apparently – digitally created by Isabel, in fact – and now Greg is going to discover the truth, just as he is in full, traumatised retreat from the emotional pain in his personal life. Every syllable of action, as we grind towards the broadly guessable finish, is jeopardy-free and interest-free. Wilson looks as if he is thinking about something else: the halting sing-song rhythms of his voice sound vapid, and Hayek is trilling, whooping and smirking away in a world of her own. • Released on 5 February on Amazon Prime Video.	349
They came under the shadow of darkness – quite literally. Just as Dracula star Bela Lugosi was no doubt being tucked up for the night, director George Melford, cast and crew made their way on to the Universal studio lot in 1931 to shoot a Spanish-language version of the Bram Stoker 1897 horror novel, filmed using the same sets and costumes as the much more familiar Tod Browning masterwork. Melford’s production of Dracula was what is known as a multiple-language version – AKA MLV – which was one method by which the recently developed sound “talkie” aimed to reach non-English speaking audiences. Initiated by the 1927 release of The Jazz Singer – which featured 15-minutes of synchronised singing and talking – producers created prints in which dialogue was replaced with music and foreign inter-titles – the “international sound version” – but this became quickly obsolete and close to extinction by 1931. Instead, producers began to make entirely new versions of the same film: Paramount Pictures’ Paramount on Parade, directed by Edmund Goulding and released in 1930, saw 13 different releases, with Czech, French, Dutch, Hungarian, German, Italian, Japanese, Romanian, Polish, Serbian, Swedish and Spanish as well as English. But the MLV was expensive, and could rarely escape the perception that they were lesser productions. The Spanish Dracula, or Drácula, may be an exception. Director Melford had been a stage actor of some note before making the jump to movies, first as character actor, then director. He was behind the camera for the sensational 1921 silent hit The Sheik, starring Rudolph Valentino. It’s been said that Melford was given the Drácula gig due to his ability to speak Spanish. He’d directed La Voluntad del Muerto for Universal, a Spanish language adaptation of The Cat Creeps, a year earlier. However multiple sources claimed, including Mexican-American actress Lupita Tovar, who played Eva Seward – Mina Harker in all but name – that the director couldn’t speak the language at all, only ever communicating via a translator. Shot in half the time the Lugosi vehicle was allotted, and on a much smaller budget, Drácula contains revealing differences. It’s 29 minutes longer the Browning’s film, with more dialogue – we see more of Dracula’s castle; and the framing of shots are argubly superior – thanks to Melford’s crew having access to Dracula’s dailies when they arrived at night, thereby being able to make revisions to lighting and camera angles. More emphasis is placed on religion; hardly surprising given the dominance of Catholicism within the markets that Melford’s film was targeting; on the other hand it’s saucier, an early dawn for the erotic tropes that would come to define define the vampire genre. Only when Tovar saw the American version did she realise how different her costumes were. “The dresses that Helen Chandler wore were all covered up,” she recalled in a 2014 interview for a DVD extra. “What they gave me were big décolletées, what you’d call sexy. I wasn’t even aware of it!” Tovar married the film’s producer, Paul Kohner, a year after Drácula’s release. They remained a couple until his death, aged 85 in 1988. Tovar was the last of the cast to pass away, doing so aged 106 in 2016. And what of the Count himself? Played by Córdoba-born Carlos Villarías – credited here as Carlos Villar – the Spaniard’s take on Dracula is less carnal than Lugosi’s, chivalrous even. He kisses the hands of the women he meets; he shakes their husbands’ hands. Less overtly monstrous perhaps, but this shroud of humanity still chills. Like so many MLVs, Drácula was long feared lost. Prints for many similar productions were often recycled for their silver content, and by the late 1950s it was assumed that Melford’s film had gone the same way. In the 1970s, however, a copy was found in a New Jersey warehouse, though large sections of it had long rotted away. Then in the early 1990s it transpired there was a copy in Cuba, a fact confirmed by the Cinemateca de Cuba in Havana. Still, it took four meetings – the UCLA Film and Television Archive had to fly out to take part in negotiations – to arrange a temporary loan. As of 2015, the film sits in the US Library of Congress, preserved forever in the National Film Registry. MLVs are long gone, but Drácula will live on forever.	866
The amount spent in the UK on making Hollywood films, such as Batman, and prestige dramas including Netflix’s The Witcher slumped by more than £700m to £2.8bn last year as the pandemic took its toll on the film and TV production industry. The amount spent on film production in the UK, mostly on Hollywood blockbusters including Mission: Impossible 7 and the third instalment of the Fantastic Beasts franchise, which halted filming on Thursday due to a Covid case on set, fell by 31% year-on-year to nearly £1.4bn. The figures also underlined the rise in high-end TV shows costing at least £1m an episode, with the amount spent overtaking that invested in film-making in the UK for the first time. The streaming wars have been led by Netflix and Amazon but the shift in viewing habits has also encouraged the BBC, Sky and ITV to invest more in big budget shows. The move has fuelled a boom in UK-made shows from Netflix’s The Crown and Sky’s Britannia to the BBC’s War of the World’s and Amazon’s Outlander. Last year, despite the disruption of the pandemic, spending on prestige shows remained relatively resilient, declining by a more modest 11% to £1.5bn, the first time it has outstripped film spend since the government introduced tax relief on high-end TV shows to encourage more to be made in the UK in 2013. However, total spend on film and high-end TV production in the UK fell by 21% year-on-year to £2.84bn, the worst level since 2016, according to the British Film Institute, which publishes the figures annually. The BFI’s annual report also highlights the torrid time cinema owners continue to experience as venues either remained closed for extended periods, or were starved of blockbuster content in the brief period when they welcomed back audiences. Cinema admissions fell by 75% last year to 44m, down from 176m in 2019, the lowest level since records began in 1928. Similarly, the box office take in the UK &amp; Ireland totalled £307m last year, an 81% year-on-year drop, the lowest level since 1992. The top grossing film of last year was WWI drama 1917, which came out pre-pandemic and made £44m. “It has been a challenging year for cinema but we remain optimistic for the day when we can welcome back audiences,” said Ben Roberts, the chief executive of the BFI. The BFI preferred to focus on the huge return of spend as the year drew to a close, thanks to initiatives such as the government-backed insurance scheme to protect against Covid shutdowns and facilities being repurposed with virus transmission safety measures in place. Almost £1.2bn was spent on film and TV production in the final three months of last year, the second highest ever quarterly spend on record, as broadcasters, Hollywood studios and streamers rushed to get the pipeline flowing to plug the pandemic gap in fresh content viewers were facing. “Last spring it was hard to imagine that we would be generating £1bn worth of production activity in the final quarter,” said Roberts. “This has been achieved by industry and government pulling together and the determination of our workforce to get back up and running.” Last month, Netflix, which spends more than $1bn (£730m) annually on UK-made content, announced it is to release 70 films this year, promising one new release each week, its biggest ever slate. And Sky, which is owned by NBC Universal-parent Comcast, has announced a 125-title film and TV slate for this year. In December, relative streaming newcomer Disney announced a doubling of content spend to $15bn by 2024, as it aims to attract as many as 260m subscribers to its Disney+ streaming service. “Production recovery in the UK is well underway and demand for content is not only still there but in fact greater than ever before,” said Adrian Wootton, chief executive of the British Film Commission, the industry body supporting UK film and TV production.	748
Like many people, one of the first things I did after the March lockdown in the UK was watch Steven Soderbergh’s 2011 film Contagion. I was completely clueless about the nature of infectious diseases, and I was foolish enough to hope that a Hollywood film might provide the answers. Which is a tremendously stupid thing to do, I’ll admit. The world is full of extraordinary epidemiologists who have dedicated their careers to researching and preparing for the sort of global pandemic that has brought humanity to its knees. If I had actually been interested in learning anything about Covid, I could have read some of their papers, or watched some of their interviews. But no. Instead I watched a made-up film about a made-up disease because, in part, it starred several pretty women. What an idiot. What an absolute, unforgivable bonehead I was for thinking that it would be of any use whatsoever. Anyway, it turns out that Matt Hancock did the same thing. Speaking to LBC this week, Hancock revealed that viewing Contagion had influenced his vaccine policy. “In the film, it shows that the moment of highest stress around the vaccine programme is not before it’s rolled out – when the scientists and manufacturers work together at pace – it’s afterwards when there is a huge row about the order of priority,” he said. To be clear, Hancock also pointed out that Contagion wasn’t his primary source of advice. But still, it’s troubling that the people in charge of disaster response turned to Hollywood in a time of historic crisis. We already know that Boris Johnson has cited Larry Vaughn, the shark-denying, catastrophe-baiting mayor of Amity Island, as a figure to look up when times are rough. But what next? Recent analysis from Nasa has suggested that the Earth might be struck by a skyscraper-sized asteroid known as 99942 Apophis in 2068, resulting in an explosion 20 times larger than the biggest nuclear bomb ever detonated. Does this mean that, somewhere in Whitehall, high-level civil servants are watching Michael Bay’s Armageddon and drawing up a list of handsome and charismatic miners they can send into space to blow it up? The Earth is long overdue a cataclysmic super-volcanic eruption. Does that mean that experts are huddled around a DVD of Dante’s Peak? Seismologists repeatedly warn of a devastating earthquake along the San Andreas fault. Does this mean that scientists are preparing to breed a clone army of Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson to take it down? That said, Contagion wasn’t entirely useless. There’s a helpful scene where Kate Winslet explains R numbers with a clarity that real-life scientists and politicians have struggled to match. Jude Law’s conspiracy-theory character neatly predicted the harrowing effects of misinformation on a frightened population. And, yes, the vaccination segment was relatively insightful. In the film, the vaccination rollout hits a bottleneck and governments have to resort to a birthday lottery to get things moving again. The UK has avoided this so far, because it ordered its vaccines earlier and in larger quantities than was recommended. Indeed, when you look back at just how badly Britain botched every element of the pandemic – except for the one that was specifically influenced by a film – perhaps I’m being much too hard on Contagion. In fact, is there any chance we can have Steven Soderbergh as health secretary?	647
Sia, the musician whose debut film earned two Golden Globe nominations on Wednesday, has addressed concerns about the movie’s depiction of autism. Writing on her Twitter account, which she shortly afterwards deleted, the artist said that she has “been listening” to the criticism surrounding the film’s portrayal of a nonverbal autistic person, played by Maddie Ziegler, who does not have autism. She said the film will now be preceded with a warning that reads: “Music in no way condones or recommends the use of restraint on autistic people. There are autistic occupational therapists that specialize in sensory processing who can be consulted to explain safe ways to provide proprioceptive, deep-pressure feedback to help with meltdown safety.” She then tweeted: “I’m sorry,” and said she plans to remove the restraint scenes from future prints. “I listened to the wrong people,” she said, “and that is my responsibility, my research was clearly not thorough enough, not wide enough.” This week, Music was the surprise recipient of two Golden Globe nominations: one in the best musical or comedy category and one for lead actress Kate Hudson. Last November, Sia first engaged online with autism rights activists who felt she was approaching the condition from the perspective of a neurotypical person, as was her leading performer. At that time, Sia remained robust in her defence of the film, writing: “The movie is both a love letter to caregivers and to the autism community. I have my own unique view of the community, and felt it is underrepresented and compelled to make it. If that makes me a shit I’m a shit, but my intentions are awesome.” A petition asking for the film to be cancelled subsequently gained more than 17,000 signatures, and the petition page was flooded with responses from people unhappy at both Sia’s approach in the film and her “lack of remorse”.	367
Author and artist Catherine Hanrahan has adapted her novel of the same name for the screen and William Olsson directs. It is the story of Margaret, a young American woman in Tokyo, who has snagged a job teaching trainee flight attendants how to enunciate their English properly. Margaret drinks a lot, parties a lot, shows up hungover and late to work; she is also into BDSM, and is a sub, but can’t find any satisfactory partner, until she chances across Kazu (Takehiro Hira), a yakuza mobster whose naked body naturally turns out to be almost completely covered in scary tattoos. He has exactly the right fiercely negligent ruthlessness when he takes her to love hotels, but through an ironic quirk of fate turns out to have a softer side – something that this liaison with Margaret has unlocked, and in bed confesses to her mournfully that he is about to get married, and this lends something weirdly poignant and melancholy to their eroticism. The film isn’t perfect, and there is a touch of orientalism about the obsessive-affair-with-Japanese-man trope (which surfaced also in Wash Westmoreland’s The Earthquake Bird in 2019). But there is also something well controlled in the movie as it maintains its cool, even pace and Alexandra Daddario’s performance as the vulnerable, secretive yet emotionally open Margaret is smart. There is also good support from Carice van Houten as Margaret’s cheerfully cynical expat friend Ines and also from Misuzu Kanno as Nakamura, the older woman who is Margaret’s employer, balancing her competing impulses towards caring and disapproval. • Released on 8 February on digital formats.	307
With Room 237, a deep dive into theories about Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining, writer-director-animator Rodney Ascher practically invented a new sub-genre of documentary: the fathoms-five-low inspection of fandom theories and nuttery. Tonally blending sympathetic dispassion and ever-so-slight amused mockery over a fast-shuffling montage of clips that just fit under the bar of fair use, Ascher’s technique created a fascinating brainstorm essay equally about cinema, spectatorship and the ability of works of art to generate interpretations well beyond the intentions of their makers. His latest, A Glitch in the Matrix, pulls off the trick again, appropriately enough on an even bigger scale. This time the subject is simulation theory: the hypothesis that we are all living inside a synthetic world, like the human beings in The Matrix movies who are kept in pods, jacked into a giant supercomputer that injects a delusion straight into their brainstems. The film interviews individuals with differing opinions on simulation theory: some philosophers, some journalists and some likable kooks who fervently believe they’re living in a simulacrum, a few of whom appear disguised in digital avatar get-ups that add a bizarre comic layer. Elsewhere there’s a long archive clip of the great sci-fi seer of simulation theory, Philip K Dick, giving a lecture in the 1970s on his theories about slippery realities that he channelled into his books The Man in the High Castle and Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said. Ascher deploys abundant clips from the Matrix films and the many film adaptations of Dick’s fiction, but there’s plenty of his own original animation to illustrate some of the stories, including an account from one young man who killed his parents because he thought he was in the Matrix and nothing mattered. Parents of adolescent and younger kids will be interested to see Minecraft world-building is also in the mix, along with Plato’s allegory of the cave, the Mandela effect and Elon Musk talking about artificial intelligence. What’s missing from this fecund brew, which you could imagine being twice as long, is any kind of judgment or analysis of the subjects. It’s up to the viewer to notice that some of the interviewees talk of deeply religious upbringings or receiving a diagnosis of schizophrenia, which might explain the roots of their beliefs. Or maybe they’re right and we are all living in a simulation. • A Glitch in the Matrix is available on digital platforms from 5 February.	459
The decades-long saga of child sexual abuse allegations against famed Hollywood director Woody Allen will be explored in a new HBO documentary series. Allen v Farrow will draw on home movies, police evidence, court documents and never-before-heard audio tapes to explore the 1992 allegation of sexual abuse against Allen by seven-year-old Dylan, his adopted daughter with his then partner, Mia Farrow; the custody case that followed in the early 1990s; Allen’s marriage to Farrow’s adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn; and the years of controversy over how to handle his films and body of work. Allen has repeatedly denied all allegations. The four-part series, which will premiere on 21 February, comes from directors Kirby Dick, Amy Ziering and Amy Herdy, the film-makers behind The Hunting Ground, the film on college campus sexual assault, and most recently On the Record, which explored longstanding allegations of sexual assault against the hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons and the music industry’s reluctance to root out sexual abuse. Allen v Farrow will feature exclusive interviews with Dylan Farrow, Mia Farrow and her son Ronan Farrow, the New Yorker journalist, as well as family friend Carly Simon, prosecutor Frank Maco, relatives, investigators, experts and eyewitnesses. The series will also take a broader look Allen’s films and how public allegations can force a reconsideration of an artist’s body of work. The series is the latest in a years-long, slow-moving reckoning for the acclaimed writer and director of such comedies as Annie Hall, Manhattan, Midnight in Paris and Blue Jasmine. In 2017, Dylan Farrow wrote an op-ed for the Los Angeles Times which asked “Why has the #MeToo revolution spared Woody Allen?” Several prominent Hollywood figures including Greta Gerwig, Colin Firth and Mira Sorvino have publicly vowed not to work with him. In 2019, Allen sued, then settled, with Amazon after the tech behemoth terminated his film deal, worth $68m, following Allen’s controversial comments on the Harvey Weinstein and #MeToo revelations. Allen called the situation “very sad for everybody involved”, but Amazon pointed to the comment: “You don’t want it to lead to a witch-hunt atmosphere, a Salem atmosphere, where every guy in an office who winks at a woman is suddenly having to call a lawyer to defend himself.’” The legal battle delayed the release of Allen’s 2017 film A Rainy Day In New York, starring Timothée Chalamet (who donated his salary to charity), until 2020, to mostly negative reviews. Allen has continued to direct films and deny the allegations, telling the Guardian in May 2020, upon the release of his memoir Apropos of Nothing: “It doesn’t pay to sue. Do I really want to be tabloid fodder for two years and go to court? And do I really care?” His 50th film, Rifkin’s Festival, starring mostly European actors and backed by the Spanish media giant Mediapro after the Amazon suit, premiered at the San Sebastián film festival in September 2020. • This article was amended on 8 February 2021. An earlier version referred to Mia Farrow as Woody Allen’s “then wife”; the couple never married.	606
There are so many things wrong with David Ayer’s original 2016 Suicide Squad movie that it’s hard to know where to start. It’s like a superhero flick from the bad old days, before Marvel and Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight trilogy. A movie made by hired guns rather than comic book fans. The suspicion is that nobody involved cared enough about this team of badass criminals turned government-backed problem solvers to imbue them with personalities. It’s well documented that Ayer lost control of the final edit to the team that put together Suicide Squad’s hugely popular trailers, resulting in a movie apparently made for filmgoers with the attention span of toddlers. As for Cara Delevingne’s excruciatingly over-the-top turn as June Moone/Enchantress … it’s remarkable that the former model escaped with her acting career intact. The story of how director James Gunn came to cross the Marvel/DC divide and sign on for forthcoming The Suicide Squad (AKA Suicide Squad 2) is a strange one. Gunn, the director of both Guardians of the Galaxy films, had been fired from part three after ill-advised tweets from more than a decade ago were dug up by the Daily Caller website. Eventually, Marvel owner Disney reinstated Gunn after several stars spoke up, and the film-maker now finds himself looking after movies for both comic book studios (Guardians of the Galaxy 3 is due in 2023, The Suicide Squad in August). He follows in the footsteps of Avengers director Joss Whedon, whose work on Justice League left a lot to be desired. Like Whedon, Gunn is accepting what at first glance looks like a DC take on the Marvel superhero flicks that helped make his name. Just like the Guardians of the Galaxy, the Suicide Squad are a motley gang of miscreants who find themselves in the position of unlikely heroes. And yet, without the protective blanket of Marvel, it remains to be seen whether Gunn will be able to repeat his previous success. A new synopsis for The Suicide Squad, released this week, gives us a hint at how the sequel will pan out. “Welcome to hell – AKA Belle Reve, the prison with the highest mortality rate in the US of A. Where the worst supervillains are kept and where they will do anything to get out – even join the super-secret, super-shady Task Force X. Today’s do-or-die assignment? Assemble a collection of cons, including Bloodsport, Peacemaker, Captain Boomerang, Ratcatcher 2, Savant, King Shark, Blackguard, Javelin, and everyone’s favourite psycho, Harley Quinn. Then arm them heavily and drop them (literally) on the remote, enemy-infused island of Corto Maltese.” “Trekking through a jungle teeming with militant adversaries and guerrilla forces at every turn, the Squad is on a search-and-destroy mission with only Colonel Rick Flag on the ground to make them behave and Amanda Waller’s government techies in their ears, tracking their every movement. As always, one wrong move and they’re dead.” Corto Maltese is a fictional island off the coast of South America that has appeared intermittently in DC Comics and related movies. It was the centre of a Cuban missile crisis-style standoff in Frank Miller’s seminal The Dark Knight Returns graphic novel, and appeared briefly in Tim Burton’s Batman as the war-torn subject of Vicki Vale’s photojournalism. The plotline sounds like a Fortnite-style video game. But if it’s going to be elevated into something we want to spend two hours watching, Gunn is going to have to really knock it out of the park. It’s easy to imagine a film-maker such as Quentin Tarantino taking this grubby Dirty Dozen-esque template and transforming it into a film that transcends its cheesy roots via snappy dialogue and narrative sleight of hand. Gunn? Well, he has a strong cast, including DC newcomers Peter Capaldi as The Thinker, Idris Elba as Bloodsport and Michael Rooker as Savant (the latter pair also hopping over from Marvel). Margot Robbie, Joel Kinnaman and Viola Davis will all return as Harley Quinn, Rick Flag and Amanda Waller, while there’s even an unspecified role for Sylvester Stallone. Let’s hope we get a detailed backstory for all of them and that Rick and Amanda receive more subtle treatments. Last time out, it felt like Kinnaman’s lines had all been left on the cutting-room floor, while Amanda came across as little more than a blunt-nosed sociopath. While the comics paint her as a bully with few redeeming features, it still felt like a waste of Davis’s talents. Gunn certainly has the chops to alchemise trashy comic book silliness into precious metal. And yet, as many of Tarantino’s imitators have found to their cost, the problem with recycling pulp is that you can easily find the end result falling apart in your hands.	917
Donald Trump has resigned from the Screen Actors Guild (Sag-Aftra), the union for US performers on film and TV, as the union’s leadership began moves to expel him. In a letter dated 4 February 2021 and addressed to Gabrielle Carteris, the union’s national president, Trump said: “I write to you today regarding the so-called Disciplinary Committee hearing aimed at revoking my union membership. Who cares!” Citing his appearances in Home Alone 2, Zoolander, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps and the TV show The Apprentice, Trump added: “I’ve also greatly helped the cable news television business (said to be a dying platform with not much time left until I got involved in politics), and created thousands of jobs at networks such as MSDNC and Fake News CNN, among many others.” After claiming the union “has done little for its members, and nothing for me”, Trump finished his letter saying: “I no longer wish to be associated with your union. As such, this letter is to inform you of my immediate resignation from Sag-Aftra. You have done nothing for me.” The union responded with a two-word statement: “Thank you.” Trump’s move follows an announcement by Sag-Aftra in January that Trump was being referred to a disciplinary committee after the Capitol breach and what the union described as “a reckless campaign of misinformation aimed at discrediting and ultimately threatening the safety of journalists, many of whom are Sag-Aftra members”. Carteris said at the time: “Donald Trump attacked the values that this union holds most sacred – democracy, truth, respect for our fellow Americans of all races and faiths, and the sanctity of the free press. There’s a straight line from his wanton disregard for the truth to the attacks on journalists perpetrated by his followers.” According to financial reports disclosed in 2020, Trump currently earns a pension of over $98,000 for work on union-covered projects, which would not be affected by his leaving.	381
The rush by film studios to buy stock in the GameStop story is a natural Hollywood reaction to a major event. Rival interpretations of the day Reddit took on Wall Street will be produced by Netflix and MGM, with the latter acquiring rights to Ben Mezrich’s forthcoming book about the news. While it’s likely Netflix will release its film first, does it really matter if it wins the race? Dotted through Hollywood’s history are releases that carry more than a passing resemblance to each other. “Twin films” are a sign of studios’ compulsion to capture a historical moment on celluloid as soon as possible. For instance, after the 2013 Boston marathon bombings came Patriots Day and Stronger; and the 2018 rescue of 12 Thai children and their football coach, first depicted in The Cave (2019), will soon be the subject of a Ron Howard movie. Going back further in history, Brian Cox’s portrayal of Britain’s wartime leader in Churchill arrived only months before Gary Oldman’s Oscar-winning turn in Darkest Hour (2017). Twinned films are a long-established phenomenon in Hollywood. Jezebel (1938), made in the shadow of the hotly anticipated Gone With the Wind, which was released the following year, was conceived in part as a consolation prize for Bette Davis, who had been unsuccessful in her attempts to be cast as Scarlett O’Hara in Gone With the Wind. Both films feature a “southern belle” caught in the deep south on the eve of the civil war. Though Jezebel hasn’t resonated in the same way as Gone With the Wind, it still had a marked success, earning a best actress Oscar for Davis. More recent years have seen this doubling up repeated on a blockbuster scale. The classic example is the match-up between Michael Bay’s Armageddon and Mimi Leder’s Deep Impact, with its attendant mythology about how Disney and Paramount fought to gain a competitive edge. Bruce Joel Rubin, co-writer of Deep Impact, said that prior to Disney passing on the script, an early meeting featured a canny executive scribbling notes throughout discussion of the film, which subsequently sparked a furious debate over plagiarism. In the end, Disney chairman Joe Roth’s last-minute decision to invest $3m in bolstering Armageddon’s special effects was designed to provide breathing space between the two. Released just one month apart in the summer of 1998, Leder’s thoughtful look at planetary doom grossed more than $300m at the international box office, while Bay’s bombastic, Aerosmith-inflected blockbuster raked in more than $550m. Being beaten to the punch is not as financially disastrous as you might imagine, but claiming the cultural space can have a significant impact. In 1997, Dante’s Peak, starring Pierce Brosnan, was released two months before Volcano, a similar tale of geological apocalypse, and while neither captivated critics and audiences, Brosnan’s buffer between Bond films is arguably more keenly remembered. In Olympus Has Fallen (2013) secret serviceman Gerard Butler rescued president Aaron Eckhart from terrorists; months later, White House Down saw Channing Tatum protecting Jamie Foxx from a similar threat. Though neither made more than $200m worldwide, Butler was gifted with a franchise that will soon return for its fourth instalment, Night Has Fallen. If there’s an air of plausible deniability to twinned films – who will notice if we just switch Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman (No Strings Attached) with Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis (Friends With Benefits), right? – then on the far end of the spectrum we have mockbusters: straight-to-video film-making that brazenly mirrors blockbuster releases. Less than a week before Sam Mendes’ 1917 arrived in UK cinemas, supermarket shelves were flooded with copies of The Trench, which was later joined by 1917: War Above the Trenches. Though these titles may frame their releases as an honest homage, or as standalone adventures, they thrive on unsure audiences. Whether twin films confirm blockbuster film-making’s lack of originality or its desire to give audiences what they want, the phenomenon isn’t going away. As Dorothy Parker shrewdly observed more than 70 years ago, plagiarism is the only “ism” Hollywood believes in.	805
In 2008, David Gordon Green surprised his modest but dedicated following by pivoting from Malickian post-industrial indie movies to Pineapple Express, a stoner buddy picture so indebted to cheeseball 80s action comedies that it commissioned its own Huey Lewis theme song. Far from a sellout, the movie still exhibited his sensibility, chasing humanist absurdities with unexpected violence, recalibrated for mainstream delight. Three years later, delight turned to alienation with his follow-up, Your Highness, a fantasy-spoof vehicle for Green’s longtime friend and collaborator Danny McBride. Critics cringed, audiences stayed away, and McBride’s career as a big-screen star was short-lived. It worked out for the best; McBride found a more productive outlet for his antihero coarseness on a series of HBO shows, and Green had his biggest hit ever with his 2018 Halloween follow-up, which McBride co-wrote. But given how often Hollywood tries and fails to make entertaining big-budget fantasy comedies, usually by ripping off Ghostbusters, the gnarly goofiness of Your Highness deserves another look 10 years later. McBride plays Thadeous, a foppish vulgarian of a prince consumed with petulant jealousy over his dashing older brother Fabious (James Franco). Fabious is engaged to marry Belladonna (Zooey Deschanel), and when an evil wizard (Justin Theroux) kidnaps her on their wedding day, Fabious and Thadeous set out on a standard-issue quest to save her. Along the way, they cross paths with vengeful warrior Isabel (Natalie Portman), along with various nymphs, knights and creatures. The best joke of Your Highness is that it’s a genuinely inventive fantasy pastiche, reminiscent of the way that the Jack Black/Kyle Gass rock band Tenacious D satirizes prog-metal bombast with well-crafted songs. Green’s movies always have a sense of texture and this one is no exception, with Green and frequent cinematographer Tim Orr capturing verdant tones before unleashing neon lightning blasts in the grand finale. The fantasy details are sketched in with the enthusiasm of detailed ballpoint-pen drawings on an eighth-grader’s binder: an acid-spitting five-headed hydra controlled by a deranged ruler sticking his hand into a cauldron of yellow goop; golden fairies ground up and snorted by the grotesque wizard; a maze of branches and eyeballs housing a pants-less minotaur. It’s all silly, yes, but in service of celebration. Green and McBride seem to find this stuff sincerely cool and worthy of their full attention, content to let the anachronism-heavy jokes swap in for (and playfully josh) the ponderous dialogue of more straight-faced fantasy epics. Even the more blatantly irreverent elements are weirdly character-based. When Thadeous learns that the lifelong kinship Fabious shares with an old soothsayer has a creepily sexualized side, it’s a statement about the traumas men train themselves to suppress or ignore in the name of masculinity and a bad-taste sight gag where McBride and Franco must make intimate contact with a lizard-y puppet character. Opposite its caricatures of impossibly pure-hearted heroism and blowhard insecurity, the movie offers exaggerations of two popular types of genre-movie female characters: Portman as an all-business badass who moves swiftly between acts of violent revenge, and Deschanel as a naif so sheltered she’s flummoxed by a fork. (Little Mermaid homage? You be the judge.) They both go a long way toward tempering McBride’s sometimes-overbearing comic style. Even that coarseness, though, has a certain honesty in the way it rejects a then common comic narrative of belated maturity, in favor of a simpler reconciliation between siblings. Like Step Brothers, the movie recognizes how many male impulses aren’t just immature but barely adolescent. While I enjoyed Your Highness from my first viewing in largely empty “premium large format” auditorium in Times Square, it looks less inexplicable (and perhaps less offensive to those who didn’t vibe with it) following another decade’s worth of Green movies, varying in content and style while remaining recognizably his. The prolific film-maker seems to increasingly make films in groups of two or three: after the studio comedies Pineapple, Highness and the similarly ill-regarded (and underrated!) The Sitter came a triptych of smaller-scale character studies toying with movie-star personas (Prince Avalanche; Joe; Manglehorn), then a pair of fact-based dramas (Our Brand Is Crisis; Stronger), and now an in-progress trilogy of Halloween sequels. Your Highness isn’t Green’s most essential film; it’s not even his most essential broad comedy. (Yes, Pineapple Express is much better.) Yet it’s far from the lazy Pineapple cash-in many saw in 2011. Like it or not, Your Highness is a part of David Gordon Green’s whole deal. Its very existence is a tribute to its creators’ bizarre desire to make it. Your Highness is available on Peacock in the US and on Amazon Prime in the UK	907
Tom Hanks leads this handsomely shot but stolid and blandly self-satisfied western, based on the 2016 novel by Paulette Jiles; it’s directed by Paul Greengrass (who co-wrote the screenplay with Luke Davies) but mostly without the dynamism and visceral action he’s known for. Hanks plays Kidd, a former Confederate captain with a secret sadness in his heart, making a living in the troubled and lawless state of Texas after the civil war, travelling around like a huckster or a preacher, reading aloud stories from the newspapers to the mostly illiterate townsfolk for 10 cents a head. One hot afternoon, he chances across the body of a hanged black man who has evidently had the charge of a terrified and now mute little white girl that Kidd finds cowering nearby. This is Johanna, whose German migrant pioneer family were slaughtered by Kiowa Native American warriors, who took Johanna away and renamed her “Cicada” but who were then slaughtered in their turn by white marauders. Lonely, rueful Kidd makes it his business to take Johanna to her German aunt and uncle, who must be persuaded to take her in. They are reasonably near San Antonio – where he can also finally make a reckoning with his own demons. As for Johanna, or Cicada, she sometimes speaks Kiowa and sometimes German but mostly nothing at all. Yet she has certain warrior skills which are to be vital for their survival. Johanna is played by the fierce young child actor Helena Zengel who made such an amazingly strong impression in the recent German drama System Crasher, in which she played a troubled nine-year-old problem child whose anarchic energy brings the social services to breaking point. Sadly, this script and this movie don’t allow her to let rip in anything like the same way. Zengel and Hanks trot along together, sort of like Mattie Ross and Rooster Cogburn in True Grit, or even Mowgli and Baloo in The Jungle Book: an odd couple who never really have a falling out, or even that much of a falling in. Tom Hanks’s own nice-guy persona encompasses the movie’s unspoken accommodations and triangulations: Kidd is a former Confederate soldier (bad) but now a mild campaigner in the cause of peace and reconciliation (good). Johanna/Cicada has seen her white kin murdered by Native Americans and then her adoptive Native American kin murdered by white bandits. So she is steered straight down the middle path of 21st-century victimhood equivalence. The one moment where the movie really comes alive, and when something really seems to be at stake, is when three deeply unpleasant men come to Kidd’s news-reading and take a vicious interest in the little blond child. They ask Kidd how much he wants for her, sneering that they could just as well take her by force. A very tense chase ensues, with Kidd all too well aware that, although he has a pistol, his shotgun is filled only with useless birdshot. This is one moment where Hanks’s risk-free decency is sensationally tested. Here are vicious murderous sex trafficker paedophiles, and Kidd must kill or be killed. It’s a powerful scene, where Greengrass’s action expertise suddenly flares up. And the rest of the time? Well, the movie is presented to us like the unexceptionable news stories that Kidd reads aloud to his crowd with a liberal message, and – disconcertingly – the liveliest news-reading scene is saved for the very end, almost happening over the closing credits. I found myself thinking of Hanks’s other “Southern” role: the sinister dandy and criminal mastermind Goldthwaite Higginson Dorr in the Coens’ ill-starred remake of the Ealing classic The Ladykillers. Not a great movie, or indeed a great role for Hanks who doesn’t quite suit villains, however tongue-in-cheek they’re supposed to be. But there was a point, or an edge, to that character. His persona here is equable and easy-going, qualities which are of course necessary to his sympathetic brand identity, but he doesn’t plausibly change in any dramatic way. This is a slow news day. • Released on 10 February on Netflix.	782
Sheep-farming brothers Colin (Sam Neill) and Les (Michael Caton) are linked by blood. Not just their own but also, like generations before them, the bloodline of the rare breed of sheep they raise on their scratch of land in Western Australia. The feud between these bristling, taciturn men has festered for decades: they haven’t spoken in 40 years. When a deadly disease is diagnosed in Les’s prize ram and the authorities order a livestock cull in the valley, his response involves whisky and a shotgun. But Colin is cannier. Can the brothers finally find common ground? Adapted from Grímur Hákonarson’s acclaimed 2015 film, this version trades frostbitten Nordic reserve for a broader comic approach. It works on the assumption that a story about grumpy old gits united against a common foe has a universal appeal. True, to an extent, but what the makers of this film fail to realise is that it was the specificity of the Icelandic original that made it such a glumly hilarious delight.

Chloé Zhao’s road movie Nomadland took home three awards at the London Critics’ Circle film awards on an evening when female film-makers dominated and Zhao’s film continued to gather momentum as the Oscars approach. A strong favourite heading into the event, Nomadland won film of the year, while its star, Frances McDormand, was named actress of the year and writer-director Zhao screenwriter of the year. Zhao’s film began generating awards buzz after it won the Golden Lion for best film at the Venice film festival, and is part of a group of films with female directors that have drawn large numbers of nominations, upending the status quo of poor representation for female film-makers. The British horror Saint Maud also took three awards, including British or Irish film of the year, with its director, Rose Glass, given breakthrough film-maker, and Morfydd Clark won British/Irish actress of the year. Sarah Gavron’s London coming-of-age tale, Rocks, scored the second most nominations with six, and on the night it took home two awards: Lucy Pardee won the technical award for her casting and Bukky Bakray won the breakthrough acting award. There was a posthumous win for Chadwick Boseman, who won best actor for his role in Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, while best supporting actor went to Shaun Parkes for his performance as Frank Crichlow, the restaurant owner turned activist, in Mangrove. Steve McQueen won best director for his five-film Small Axe anthology (which included Mangrove), while Riz Ahmed was named British/Irish actor of the year for his performances in Sound of Metal and Mogul Mowgli. The Long Goodbye, the short film that Ahmed wrote, produced and starred in, also won British/Irish short of the year. “As always, the critics have spread the love around among a range of films this year, particularly recognising female film-makers and a diverse range of talent both behind and in front of the cameras,” said the film section chair, Rich Cline. Cline added that the combination of theatrical and streaming releases fuelled by the Covid-19 pandemic meant the judges had to watch an unusually large number of films. Boseman’s award was accepted by his co-star Colman Domingo, and Maria Bakalova also appeared virtually to accept supporting actress of the year for Borat Subsequent Moviefilm, with the entire event being streamed on the Critics’ Circle YouTube channel. The Danish director Thomas Vinterberg won foreign-language film of the year for Another Round, his story about a teacher who turns to alcohol, while Alexander Nanau’s Collective won documentary of the year.

As a documentarian, Rodney Ascher is more comfortable than many with subjectivity. Having previously delved into a host of far-fetched theories about Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining with Room 237, Ascher now explores “simulation theory”: the belief that the world in which we exist is artificial – a rendered reality; part of a game or experiment controlled by a higher intelligence. The jumping-off point for this elliptical combination of computer animation, archive footage and virtual interviews is a 1977 lecture by Philip K Dick. But the development of the idea is traced from Plato’s allegory of the cave and numerous religions, through films, literature and computer gaming, to current advocates such as Elon Musk. It’s a messy, mind-blowing collision of philosophy, technology, religion and fruit-loop paranoia which, while it doesn’t exactly make a watertight case, does provide a fascinating, and in one case deeply disturbing, insight into the thought processes of those who believe it. • On multiple digital platforms	189
One of the genuine guilty pleasures of last year’s lockdown releases was Skyfire, a spectacularly silly Chinese disaster movie in which Jason Isaacs builds a hotel on the side of a volcano and then tries to reassure everyone (in a South African accent) that “we’re all going to be fine!” After watching Gerard Butler get into a fistfight with the weather in Geostorm, I had similar expectations of this end-of-the-world action film about an impending meteor strike. But though originally announced with Chris Evans as star and Neill Blomkamp of District 9 as director, Greenland turns out to be the perfect vehicle for Butler and director Ric Roman Waugh, reuniting after Angel Has Fallen for a sharply written and grippingly executed apocalypse pic that, like 2008’s breakout hit Cloverfield, punches well above its mid-budget weight. Butler is John Garrity, a structural engineer in Atlanta attempting to rebuild his broken marriage to estranged wife Allison (Morena Baccarin). The couple’s diabetic young son, Nathan (Roger Dale Floyd), is thrilled by news of a comet due to make “the closest flyby in history”. But when John receives a presidential alert announcing that his family have been chosen for “shelter”, it becomes clear that bits of the comet are on course for Earth. Next thing, “the sky is on fire”, Tampa is toast, and the Garrity clan are heading for a military airfield to be transported to bunkers near the north pole. While fans of Butler’s action movies may be expecting him to simply punch the asteroid out of the sky, Greenland instead casts him as just another ordinary Joe caught up in the same chaos as everyone else. “That didn’t take long,” says John sardonically about the looters he spies from the wheel of his car, before promptly getting stuck in the kind of traffic jam commuters encounter every day. When he and Allison are separated after a mix-up with Nathan’s meds, failing phone signals and a visit to the chemist become panic-inducing matters of life and death, thanks to a whip-sharp script by Buried writer Chris Sparling. Even Butler’s inevitable scraps have the anxious atmosphere of a nasty bar-room brawl (plaudits to cinematographer Dana Gonzales), while Allison’s hitchhiked lift with nice couple Ralph and Judy turns a rear-view mirror into a window on to the darkness of the “civilised” soul. The threat of destruction falling from the heavens is a disaster movie staple dating back to the 1916 Danish silent Verdens Undergang, about a passing comet wreaking earthly havoc. Since then, we’ve had everything from Abel Gance’s troubled 1931 French sci-fi thriller La fin du monde, in which rioters and revellers await doomsday, to 1979’s star-studded Meteor, about cold war enemies working together to fend off an approaching threat. Yet for all its fiery action elements (exploding planes, torched cities etc), Greenland arguably has more in common with the character-driven traits of Lorene Scafaria’s end-of-days romcom Seeking a Friend for the End of the World (or even Lars von Trier’s Melancholia?) than with the 1998 double-whammy of Deep Impact and Armageddon, the latter featuring Bruce Willis as a deep-sea digger enlisted to ‘“drill some holes” in space. Following a career-best turn in Kristoffer Nyholm’s sorely underrated psychological thriller The Vanishing (AKA Keepers), Butler sinks his oft-gritted teeth into a role in which strength and weakness are intertwined like the duelling Scottish-American strains of his accent. Strong support from the likes of Scott Glenn and Hope Davis adds dramatic weight, while Gabriel Fleming’s sharp editing and David Buckley’s propulsive score pluck alternately at the heart strings and the adrenal glands. The result is a first-rate B-picture, and a timely reminder of the delights of well-crafted popcorn thrills. On Amazon Prime Video	729
The novelist Kingsley Amis wrote about being a horror film addict for the Observer Magazine of 7 July 1968 (‘Terror in the Cinema’). This is surprising because Amis had an extreme fear of the dark and of being alone. Of course, this being Amis, he objected to the popular term. ‘Terror film would be a better label,’ he argued, because ‘they are not symptoms of the sickness of our society’. Amis was an anti-intellectual when it came to genre films – ‘eggheads out!’ – preferring to simply enjoy the ‘cavortings both abominable and harmless’. Indeed, when he wondered what the appeal of the horror film was, he wrote: ‘Like Mark Twain on a dissimilar occasion, I have an answer to that: I don’t know.’ He argued that ‘The adult Western, like Bad Day at Black Rock, demonstrating its seriousness by short-changing us on action, has not made its mark.’ That may have been true, but it certainly wasn’t true of the John Sturges noir classic. ‘The psychological thriller, under Hitchcock, has done better,’ Amis said, ‘though it only really clicked when it abandoned the supposedly deep probing of Spellbound for the fairly straight and very enthusiastic Grand Guignol of Psycho.’ He admired the US contribution to ‘the great horror revival’, especially that of Vincent Price ‘whether receiving or dealing out assorted gory treatments’. Difficult also to disagree with his assessment of ‘one of the best horror episodes of all’ – the ventriloquist’s-dummy sequence in 1945’s Dead of Night. Amis had an amusingly hard time suspending his disbelief in The Fly: ‘Here, the hastiest of mumbo-jumbo was run through with the palpable design of proceeding to the disagreeable activities and physical appearance of a fly with a chap’s head and a chap with a fly’s head… Even science-fiction ought to have balked at the idea of giving both these characters some kind of human intelligence.’	384
They didn’t quite burn witches in Australia in the 1940s and 50s, but they didn’t make it easy for them either. Take Rosaleen Norton, an artist and self-identified witch who the tabloids called “the witch of Kings Cross”. She was repeatedly arrested, had her artwork burned and was shunned and mocked by society. Norton eked out a modest living selling her art, and putting spells and hexes on people. Her story has been captured in a new documentary, released online on Tuesday. Norton, who lived in Kings Cross in the postwar years until her death in 1979, had been fascinated with the occult since she was a child. Aged 23 and living away from her conservative family in a variety of lodgings and squats in the seedy Sydney suburb, she began to practise trance magic and, later, sex magic. The former involved invoking spells, rituals and taking substances with the aim of achieving a higher form of consciousness; the latter was popularised by the British occultist Aleister Crowley and involved having sex with multiple partners that invoked rituals similar to Tantra. The fascinating story of Norton’s life may have been lost had it not been for the commitment of Sonia Bible to bring it to the screen. Made on a shoestring budget, and largely crowd- and self-funded, the documentary is a labour of love. The film-maker managed to track down several of Norton’s contemporaries before they died, and sourced diaries and artworks that were in private hands; she melds the historical documents with dramatic recreations (Norton is played by Kate Elizabeth Laxton). “When I started making the film, I knew this story was on the edge of living memory,” Bible says. “This would be the last film on the late 50s, because the people have died. The oral history of people who were there – that has gone now.” She came across Norton’s story in the tabloid papers, while researching 2011’s Recipe for Murder – another documentary set in postwar Sydney. “It was a time of great social change,” Bible says. “A dark noir time before pointy cars and rock’n’roll, but in the lead-up to the counterculture. All her life, Norton combined her interest in the occult with art. Her paintings, some of which were seized by police and burned, could loosely be defined as esoteric: canvases often filled with hectic images of women embracing the Greek god Pan, snakes and horned demons. Australia in the postwar years was almost 90% Christian, and Norton was made a target for her beliefs. Surveillance and raids from the vice squad, and seizure of her work, criminalised her, and turned her into a notorious and shocking tabloid figure. One of her sex magic partners, the celebrated Sydney Symphony Orchestra conductor Sir Eugene Goossens, was forced to flee Australia when his luggage at Sydney airport was found to contain pornography. The pair each suffered in their own way for transgressing the strict moral boundaries of the time. “There was a rapid change in relationships between men and women, social conventions and politics,” Bible says. Right now we are also living in a time of great change, but when you are in it, you can’t analyse it.” Part of the tragedy of Norton’s story is that she was born too soon – in 1917. If she were alive now, there would be a whole community of witches to connect with on TikTok – but even being born 10 years later would have made a difference, according to Bible. “If she had been launching herself in the 1960s, with the counterculture and feminism in full swing, she would have been like Brett Whiteley … She was at the vanguard and she did have an impact and inspired people. Young people went up to the Cross looking for her.” But even though Norton’s life was hard, Bible cautions about viewing her with pity. “She lived the life she wanted. She didn’t value money. She was very happy. She had her art and her religion. She lived life on her own terms and towards the end she had a flat in Kings Cross, given to her by the church. “People felt sorry for her, this old woman living in the Cross with her cats. But in her 60s she was dropping acid and still making art. She was very happy.” • The Witch of Kings Cross releases worldwide on 9 February on Amazon, iTunes, Vimeo and GooglePlay; it will be in selected cinemas from 11 February	873
Roger Corman, director My Edgar Allan Poe adaptations began in 1960 with The Fall of the House of Usher. I held off doing The Masque of the Red Death, because I felt it had some similarities to Ingmar Bergman’s The Seventh Seal, with its hooded figures, and I might be accused of copying. But it got to the point where it was the best unadapted one left, so I thought I’d go ahead and worry about it later. What interested me was Vincent Price’s character, Prince Prospero, who believes God is dead and therefore he is free to do whatever he wants – to be his own God. I could also see a little bit of the 1960s counterculture in the idea of the Red Death plague sweeping the country, with Prospero and his followers holing up in a castle. Part of the counterculture at the time was about rebelling against authority and pointing out how the elite was able to protect itself at the expense of the people. I never had anyone else but Vincent in mind for Prospero. He was highly educated and cultured, and had been a leading man when he was younger. But he was also just a bit offbeat, making him ideal to play intelligent, cultured but tormented men. My previous Poe adaptations had done especially well in England. So Anglo-Amalgamated, the company that distributed them, suggested I go there to make Masque. English subsidies meant I had a larger budget – about $400,000 – and a longer schedule. Shooting there also meant we got Nicolas Roeg on board, who did a beautiful job of the photography. Hazel Court, who played Prospero’s mistress, didn’t have any reluctance enacting the satanic rites. It was a great moment for her when she marries Satan and falls into a delirium. She took over the picture at that moment. On the other hand, Jane Asher had that youthful, innocent quality as the peasant girl Francesca. One Friday, she brought her boyfriend, a musician, to the set. I had no idea who he was. That Sunday, I saw a headline in the paper: “The Beatles conquer London!” I realised her boyfriend was Paul McCartney. I saw him a few years ago at Vanity Fair’s Oscars party and said to my wife: “He’s never going to remember me.” But he came over, smiled and said: “Masque of the Red Death!” The hostility the film received from the US Catholic Legion of Decency came as a total surprise. I’m a lapsed Catholic myself. We had to make cuts for blasphemy and nudity, and the film was censored even more heavily in the UK. But I’m being asked to talk about it a great deal at the moment, with the pandemic. I’m told ratings on streaming platforms are sky-high. The Red Death plays almost as if it were about the coronavirus. And Prospero’s behaviour – shutting himself away in the castle – is not dissimilar to our former president’s. Jane Asher, actor I loved horror films and was a fan of Poe and Vincent Price, so I jumped at it. I think Roger had seen me in other things: I had been in a TV version of Romeo and Juliet with David Weston, who ended up playing my boyfriend in Masque. Being an incarnation of Christian goodness wasn’t something that came naturally to me. As a confirmed atheist, I was definitely playing against type. Roger helped shape my performance with kindness, humour and encouragement – not always the way directors use their power, especially with a 17-year-old. Vincent was a funny, kind, fatherly figure to me. What I most picked up from him was the ease, enjoyment and sense of fun with which he approached every day. I remember walking through the beautiful coloured rooms, in my wonderful medieval dress and elaborate hairstyle, and loving every minute of it. But I hated doing the bath scene, where I’m prepared for Prospero’s court. They stuck some awful little modesty circles on to my nipples and they kept floating off in the water. I’d reach for them wildly and try to stick them back on. It drove the camera operator crazy, as he had to keep cutting the shot. I could sense his impatience with this silly girl, which made me all the more anxious. John F Kennedy’s assassination happened during our schedule. I have sad memories of standing for a minute’s silence. It was shocking for Roger and the other Americans on set. Today the film has obvious parallels, of course, though I guess the Red Death, with blood oozing out of every pore, is nearer to Ebola than to Covid. A restored and extended version of The Masque of the Red Death is available on Blu-ray, DVD and digital.	934
There is a delicate mixture of sensuality and creativity in this documentary. Patric Chiha follows the rehearsal and performance of a dance piece called Crowd by the Franco-Austrian artist and choreographer Gisèle Vienne, about the 90s club scene. The film follows the dance itself and stages one-on-one conversation scenes in which the young dancers talk about each other and the characters they play – a higher gossip, perhaps, about their lives and how this fictional creation shapes their sense of themselves and their sexuality. Compared with, say, Gaspar Noé’s orgiastic dance movie Climax, If It Were Love is certainly more calm and less mad, more ruminative and less confrontational. Perhaps what it is about fundamentally is youth, something each dancer radiates unknowingly: a pure energy and abandon and openness. It would be better to witness this dance piece live (a Covid-era yearning) but there is something interesting in seeing this eternal theme of youth explored and embodied. A dancer might talk about how a kiss did not happen with another character on stage – or, alternatively, that it did happen – and the exchange feels personally charged and intimate, like a conversation taking place after a party, with people confiding who they think they are in love with. And of course to some extent these conversations themselves are fictional performances, which the film builds into the official choreography. If It Were Love is probably more of a festival event film than anything, but it is valuable and pregnant with ideas. • Released on 11 February on Mubi.	286
In the forthcoming movie Anti-Life, Bruce Willis plays the leader of a roughneck crew of mechanics tasked with saving the remnants of humanity from the claws of a murderous shape-shifting alien. In another age – say, 25 years ago – there is a chance that Anti-Life would have wound up as the seventh or eighth biggest film of the year. However this is 2021, and Anti-Life looks destined to become yet another miserable, unloved video-on-demand (VOD) offering that primarily exists as a vehicle for Bruce Willis to sleepwalk to his paycheque. Or at least that would be the case if the cinemas were open. But they’re not, so Anti-Life finds itself on an equal pegging with every other movie that comes out. Because now all movies, be they compromised blockbusters or terrible late-period Bruce Willis filler items, are VOD movies. Regardless of quality, they are destined to be flopped on to the same dreary streaming menu. At time of writing, the “top new releases” section on Rakuten includes Wonder Woman 1984, The New Mutants, an Anthony Mackie/Jamie Dornan double-header that could be about anything, a documentary positing the theory that we all live in a computer simulation, and a film called Jiu Jitsu, where Nicolas Cage beats up some aliens with a sword. This is the new movie landscape, and it’s a level playing field. Now that we don’t have to sneak off work or hire babysitters to catch a movie at the cinema, all films will be judged on the same criteria. Sometimes that criteria is: “I’ve heard good things about this.” Other times it’s: “Screw it, there’s nothing else on and I want to watch Nicolas Cage wang a sword about to pay off his tax bill.” What I’m trying to say is this: it isn’t completely implausible to assume that Anti-Life will be a hit. It will make as much money as Wonder Woman at the cinema, which is to say nothing at all, and the stuck-at-home population may well be so starved of entertainment that they want to see what Bruce Willis is up to, if only out of morbid curiosity. In the spirit of public service, I should point out that this is a bad idea – because Anti-Life is cheap and dull, and Willis seems like he’s phonetically repeating all his lines into a void. But people might still watch it, just as they might watch Eye for an Eye, the forthcoming John Travolta detective movie that seems like the byproduct of an administrative snafu whereby the entire production budget was accidentally spent on wigs. Or Willy’s Wonderland, where (and I’d like to clarify that this is a real film that actually exists), Nicolas Cage has a bare-knuckle fistfight with a bloodthirsty beret-wearing crocodile mannequin in a haunted theme park. When all of these films land on VOD services, they’ll land with precisely the same impact as a blockbuster. The only thing separating Willy’s Wonderland from, say, Godzilla vs Kong is the size of its publicity budget. And, arguably, even that doesn’t matter too much at the moment. Both films will be sharing a landing page on a streaming site. It’s a binary decision: King Kong punching a big crocodile or Cage punching a big crocodile. With that in mind, this could become a golden age for fading legacy stars forced to slum it on VOD. Now that that’s the only way to watch new releases, these unfashionable old-timey workhorses have suddenly found themselves back in the game. Maybe Boss Level, a “death-loop action thriller”, will prove to be Mel Gibson’s gateway back to the A-list. Maybe Original Gangster, a film about an orphan in gangland London, will provide the shot in the arm for Steve Guttenberg that has been absent for the last 20 years. Maybe Nemesis, potentially the most generic Billy Murray flick ever made, will drag Nick Moran’s career back to his 1990s heyday. Sure, this might all be a fleeting phenomenon, either because the cinemas reopen or all blockbusters start being released straight to streaming. But now, even if this only lasts for another six weeks or so, this broken new landscape means that there’s a very good chance that Nicolas Cage could regain his crown as the biggest goddamn movie star in the world.	839

Matthew Rankin is an experimental Canadian film-maker now presenting his debut feature, and the director he most obviously resembles is the silent-movie pasticheur Guy Maddin – a comparison some will find intriguing and others heart-sinking. For me, it’s somehow both. But there are interesting signs that Rankin has something Maddin does not: a sense of humour. We get one or two actual laughs. The Twentieth Century is a weird melange of expressionist theatrics, monochrome and bleached-out colourisations (although it is not faux-silent in the Maddin style, and no scratches on the print), sometimes resembling a stage-play. It is a quirky dream-comedy about Mackenzie King, Canada’s venerable Liberal prime minister and establishment panjandrum, which satirises the country’s stolid colonial traditions. King – or a fictionalised version of him – is played by Dan Beirne as an earnest, priggish young careerist with a Stan Laurel-ish bowler hat. He yearns to be prime minister, subservient to the British colonial establishment, symbolised by a national flag called the “Disappointment”. King is also in love with his political rival’s daughter Ruby (Catherine St-Laurent) but finds himself drawn to his elderly mother’s Francophone Quebecers separatist nurse (Sarianne Cormier) and there are bizarre sexual shenanigans, as King derives secret pleasure from sniffing Catherine’s discarded boot. It is funny when King and his competitors have to go through a series of wacky tests (in lieu of anything like a democratic election) to see if they have the right stuff to be a properly pompous and pointless Canadian prime minister. Finally, the film dissolves in silliness and whimsy, but not before it’s given us some surreal spectacle. • Released on 15 February on Mubi.	325
You know what you’re getting with Tom Hanks. If his name is at the top of the bill (and it invariably is), you can be pretty sure you are watching an accessible, warming story that speaks to the better person in all of us. Hanks only plays good guys these days: principled heroes who do the right thing and naturally take charge, whether it’s leading troops into battle or toys on a rescue mission, landing an out-of-control plane or repelling Somali pirates (Hanks himself has noted how many of his characters are named “Captain something”). Like his co-stars, we follow him because we trust him. In a 2013 poll, he was voted “most trusted person in America”. Now here comes the western News of the World, with Hanks as a liberal-minded civil war veteran (yes, another captain), who reads out the newspapers to information-starved Texans. When he finds an orphaned girl abducted by Native Americans, it’s a safe bet he’s not going to sell her or kill her or anything. You just know he’ll take her under his wing and steadily develop a paternal bond that speaks to the better person in all of us. There is plenty to recommend about News of the World, but with Hanks at the helm, there are few surprises. It feels like a long time since he played un-Hanks-like characters such as Andrew Beckett in Philadelphia, or even Forrest Gump. He is no longer an actor but an icon. This is a condition that affects many a veteran actor. James Stewart, for example, who also became a byword for American decency. Or perhaps Michael Caine, who ceased all pretence of “disappearing into the role” some time in the 1990s. Next up, Hanks is at least going vaguely against type, playing Elvis’s manager Colonel Tom Parker, who was far from a paragon of virtue. It was while filming that in Australia last year that Hanks caught coronavirus, the first high-profile celebrity to publicly do so. He handled it, as you’d expect, with honesty and humility. And the world loved him back in return. He is practically a living saint, like David Attenborough or Dolly Parton. Icons have their uses, especially in these divided times. News of the World resonates with the present moment. Hanks’s character’s fellow Confederates are resentful, clinging to white-supremacist beliefs, even refusing to accept the legitimacy of their new president, Ulysses S Grant. More than just simply transmitting the news, Hanks tailors it to what he thinks his audiences might need to hear, adding in a few unifying sentiments. “We’re all hurtin’,” he tells a fractious mob. “These are difficult times.” Coming from him, it means something. There is still time for Hanks to surprise us with a genuinely subversive role: a serial killer, say, or an evil soft toy, but perhaps it’s best for all of us that he doesn’t. At this stage, it could trigger the collapse of civilisation as we know it.	598
Did you ever hear the one about the visionary director who went into the jungle with Marlon Brando and nearly lost his mind while trying to adapt a dark Victorian-era literary classic about civilization’s heart of darkness? No, not that one. The other one. Unlike Apocalypse Now, there’s never been any grand reappraisal of the 1996 version of The Island of Dr Moreau. Aside from inspiring a couple of memorable pop culture parodies, that film’s legacy is purely destructive: it killed original director Richard Stanley’s career for a solid two decades, precipitated Val Kilmer’s expulsion from the A-list, and cemented Brando as a laughingstock during his twilight years. This is to say nothing of the collective trauma its implausible production inflicted on the rest of its cast and crew (all of which is covered in the entertaining documentary Lost Soul: The Doomed Journey of Richard Stanley’s Island of Dr Moreau). Today, it is universally regarded as one of the worst movies of the 90s, and while there are some who consider it so-bad-it’s-good, it enjoys nowhere near the same camp cachet as fellow big-budget turkeys from its era (although it would certainly make for a perfect double feature with the most recent inductee to this disreputable canon, Cats). It falls then on me to defend the film on un-ironic grounds – a mission that will no doubt result in my being thoroughly and deservedly savaged, not unlike the titular good doctor. But while I would never argue that The Island of Dr Moreau is a good movie, I do say it is altogether too strange and too memorable to be dismissed as garbage. The third cinematic adaptation of HG Wells’s great 1896 science fiction novel, this updated retelling finds a plane crash survivor (David Thewlis) land on a mysterious island run by a messianic mad scientist (Brando) and populated by a horrifying cross section of human-animal hybrids. As he attempts to escape, rebel factions within the vivisected tribe plot to free themselves from the shackles of their god-like master. The end result is basically Planet of the Apes by way of Jonestown, or even the recent Capitol riot. Scoff if you will, but I defy you to watch the movie’s (admittedly ham-fisted) final coda and not think of this month’s events. If that all sounds unpleasant, well, that’s the point. It’s also a major point in the film’s favor. If nothing else, Moreau ought to be appreciated as one of the gnarliest, most aggressively stomach-churning movies ever produced by a major studio (unbelievably, it carries a PG-13 rating). This is due mostly to the centerpiece makeup effects, courtesy of Stan Winston Studios, which run the gamut from strikingly realistic to uncannily off-putting to outright comical. But collectively, the beast people – including a leopard man, hyena man, pig woman, a couple of dog boys, and, most memorable of all, a four-foot tall, flayed-skinned Brando clone – make for a truly revolting collection of monsters. Like Thewlis’s character (and probably Thewlis himself), the viewer is consistently on the verge of hurling. John Frankenheimer, who replaced Stanley as director after only the second day of shooting, doubles down on the intoxicated, carnivalesque atmosphere by loading the frame with wide-angle closeups, split diopters, arc shots and Dutch angles, all of which heighten the utter insanity unfolding on screen. Several of the most baffling scenes come courtesy of Brando’s constant tinkering and improvising: his grand reveal, which finds him draped in a white muumuu and caked in Kabuki makeup; a piano duet with his tiny clone where they’re stacked like musical Matryoshka dolls; a rambling heart-to-heart with his cat-woman daughter (Fairuza Balk, sadly, mostly wasted) while she pours ice into a metal bucket he’s wearing as a hat. Brando may have been taking the piss with these bugnuts ideas, but they imbue the film with a heavy dose of dream logic. Meanwhile, his co-star and fellow prima donna Kilmer finds himself playing another Jim Morrison type, only more soured and sinister. His open contempt for the material informs his embittered character, lending a sharp edge to the proceedings that slices through the druggy fog lying over it all. Kilmer was supposedly a real bastard behind the scenes, but you can’t say he’s not giving a good performance, especially once he starts hilariously aping and mimicking Brando in the apocalyptic third act. It’s cliche to describe a movie as a “fever dream”, but in this case, the term truly fits. After watching The Island of Dr Moreau, the viewer is sure to feel pretty queasy, a little sleazy, and probably very confused as to what they just went through. Does this make for a pleasant viewing experience? No, but it’s makes for a memorable one. We think of Hollywood as a dream factory, but no one ever said they had to be nice dreams.

In 2005 Michael Apted, then president of the Directors Guild of America, sent me an email saying that he wanted to set up a meeting of British film and television directors, to seek to counteract the disastrous erosion of their rights, creative and financial. I had been his assistant at Granada TV 30 years earlier. Three months later more than 100 people, few of whom knew each other personally, gathered in central London. Michael spoke quietly, pointing out that we were represented by multiple organisations and that this was a catastrophic weakness. A group of us volunteered to meet again and two years later a powerful single voice, Directors UK, emerged. It would not have done so without Michael’s gentle but firm insistence.	140
A movie from Denmark that sounds enjoyably bizarre but actually amounts to a yucky helping of torture/imprisonment porn and gonzo violence. Sara Hjort Ditlevsen is Mia, a stylish woman with a liking for horses and BDSM. Her rich but dull husband, Thomas (Anders Heinrichsen), is squeamish about gratifying Mia’s tastes, but hardly squeaky clean. He is a secret investor in a creepy eternal-youth genetic treatment programme, being developed by the couple’s sinister neighbour Dr Isabel Ruben (Signe Egholm Olsen), who looks 40 but is actually 60 and has some sort of hold on Thomas; she is now kidnapping young women off the streets for her research like a latter-day Elizabeth “Blood Countess” Báthory. Mia tries investigating Dr Ruben’s loathsome facility and finds herself walled up there as well. The hero/villain dynamic in this film gets muddled, which is important for this kind of horror-melodrama: Mia is at first presented as not very nice – arrogant, maybe, infatuated with wealth and status, and nursing unresolved feelings about her dark taste in transgressive sex. But other people then easily trump her nastiness and Mia has to be a sexualised victim-heroine in the evil torture-dungeon scenario (although her BDSM is now presented as ironic). Thomas’s split loyalties, meanwhile, make him seem feeble rather than complex. As for Dr Ruben, she has a Rosa Klebb-like energy that would be interesting in a less humourless film. • Available from 15 February on digital formats.	280
A breezily westernised style of Chinese movie is on offer in this 2018 debut feature from Chinese-American film-maker Cathy Yan, who two years later went to Hollywood to direct Birds of Prey, starring Margot Robbie. Dead Pigs is an ensemble dramedy set in Shanghai that satirises – in a distinctly lenient way – the commercialism eating away at China’s heart. It is inspired by a real-life incident in which thousands of dead pigs were found in the city’s Huangpu river, dumped by poverty-stricken farmers who couldn’t pay the disposal fees; the pig symbolism reminded me a tiny bit of Alan Bennett’s A Private Function. Candy Wang (Vivian Wu) is a beauty salon owner who lives in her parents’ rickety old house, the only one standing in a rubble-strewn waste ground, because she is holding out against offers from a property company called Golden Happiness; it wants to build a bizarre Vegas-style development there based on Barcelona, complete with a tacky replica of the Sagrada Família. Her brother Old Wang (Haoyu Yang) is in dire financial trouble after borrowing money from gangsters to fund his absurd “investment portfolio” in pigs, which have all died. Old Wang’s son Zhen (Mason Lee) is a hard-up waiter who pretends to his dad he’s doing well; he befriends wealthy Instagram-style princess Xia Xia (Meng Li) and soon finds out how lonely and unhappy she really is. Meanwhile, Golden Happiness have hired a smooth American architect called Sean (David Rysdahl), whose US qualifications are phoney: he has been recruited by another American, Angie (Zazie Beetz), for sideline work as a model for promo events, pretending to be an American celeb or reality TV star. The movie zings and pinballs around, ricocheting within its ironic pattern of coincidences, and those dead pigs keep bobbing metaphorically up, reported by TV news broadcasts – always a cheesy and unconvincing storytelling technique. Dead Pigs is an unassuming topical entertainment (rather different from the movies of its executive producer Jia Zhangke), but diverting and well-acted. • Released on 12 February on Mubi.	400
Is this a tale of abuse, or forbidden love? Or is there something insidious in asking that question, suggesting an ambiguity that will err leniently on the side of love? Slalom is the debut feature by director and co-writer Charlène Favier, who has indicated that it is drawn from personal experience and her own teen years growing up in the ski resort of Val-d’Isère in south-eastern France. It is impeccably acted and beautifully shot, although I wondered if it is burdened by a softcore-tasteful aesthetic and a tactful reluctance to take its own narrative implications very far. The movie finishes on an unresolved chord, as if we have left the story months or years before the actual scandalous denouement. But it is arguably faithful to the mood of messy bewilderment and frustration that governs the ongoing situation. A retired slalom ski champion – whose retirement might have been due to injury – is now pouring all his passion and frustration into coaching in a facility leased from a school. This is Fred, played by Jérémie Renier, who is a fierce and exacting teacher of teenage skiers, turning them into possible national champions and even future contestants at the Olympic Games. Almost from the very first, it is clear that his star pupil is 16-year-old Lyz, played by Noée Abita, who has got what it takes both in terms of skill and energy but also those dark, fissile ingredients of submission and self-abasement. Her divorced mum Catherine (Muriel Combeau) is away working in Marseille, and has a new boyfriend there, leaving Lyz alone in the apartment. So Lyz is lonely, in need of love and a parent figure. Fred is dynamic and compelling, but with an abuser’s mastery of combining insults with praise: he humiliates Lyz and berates her in front of the others (because he believes in her, naturally, and is supposedly angry at her for falling short of her potential) and then switches devastatingly to gentleness and praise and a boyish delight when she wins. When Lyz’s academic grades start to slide (her ski training is conditional on good schoolwork) and her mother confesses she can’t be at home to help with her studies, Fred suggests that Lyz move in with him and his partner, Lilou (Marie Denarnaud). Favier cleverly shows how, when the sexual approaches happen, they are horribly inevitable because they fold into a physically intimate existence that Fred has spent many months getting Lyz used to. The training process has actually been grooming (a word once associated with preparing someone for greatness or stardom). The initial scenes in which Fred briskly and unselfconsciously tells Lyz to strip to her underwear (in his office, with no one else present) so he can weigh her and measure her body fat are almost unwatchable, because the movie, like Fred’s face, is deadpan. More obviously charged is the moment when Fred comes to see Lyz in the girls’ showers (she has not removed her costume) and tells her to be proud of her periods. But there is nothing deadpan or ambiguous about what happens later. The key question is: who else knows and has it happened before? The grey area between passionately committed teaching and abuse is a familiar topic. Yet the film ingeniously merges it with the ambiguous experience of slalom ski-ing: exhilarating and euphoric, but also dangerous and even an emotional death-wish, surrendering to the downhill rush. • Released on 12 February on Curzon Home Cinema.	656
Moufida Tlatli, the pioneering Tunisian film-maker behind much-admired festival hits The Silences of the Palace and The Season of Men, has died aged 73. News media said that she died on Sunday, with the news confirmed by the Tunisian ministry of culture. Tlatli remains best known for her breakthrough 1994 feature The Silences of the Palace, a lyrical study of a woman’s return to an abandoned royal residence, which tackled the themes of exploitation and trauma as experienced across generations of Arab women. It won a string of international awards, including the Sutherland trophy at the London film festival for the most “original and imaginative” film of the year, and was named as one of Africa’s 10 best films by critic and director Mark Cousins. The film was inspired by her mother’s difficult life; in 2001, Tlatli told the Guardian she “was riven with guilt … It was so insupportable, exhausting, suffocating.” Tlatli told the Guardian: “Traditionally in the Arab film world, a girl works in continuity or is an editor. I had never thought of making films.” In her next film, released in 2000, Tlatli dealt with not dissimilar material about relations between the sexes. The Season of Men is about a community on the Tunisian island of Djerba whose males spend most of the year away working, and return only for a month. The Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw called it “a beautifully lucid, compassionate film [and] a powerful and deeply engaging family drama”. Like Silences of the Palace, The Season of Men found much favour on the international film circuit, winning a number of awards. Tlatli was born in 1947 in Sidi Bou Said and studied film editing in Paris, before returning to Tunisia in 1972 to work as an editor. She completed a third feature, Nadia et Sarra, in 2004, starring Palestinian actor-director Hiam Abbass. In 2011, Tlatli was appointed minister for culture in the transitional government after the Tunisian revolution. •This article was amended on 9 February to correct the assertion that Tlatli was the first female Arab film-maker to direct a feature film.	402
Ever felt like you’ve lost a whole year of your life in the blink of an eye? This is the relatable – and strangely prescient – premise of Australian actor Josh Lawson’s second feature film, Long Story Short. On paper, it sounds like a perfect post-Covid movie: a charming high-concept romcom that offers timely introspection about seizing the day. What better way to welcome back cinemagoers who find themselves mysteriously 12 months older since their last visit? But on the screen, it never quite lives up to the potential of its own idea. Long Story Short feels claustrophobic and rushed, hamstrung by its Groundhog Day plot mechanics. There are plenty of laughs throughout but, as they’re never quite married with the film’s sickly sentimentality, the romcom’s grand ideas about life and love land with a hollow “YOLO” (the term is used more than once, not always ironically). Though Harold Ramis’ iconic film gets mentioned a few times throughout, Long Story Short owes more to A Christmas Carol (and its various descendants) than Groundhog Day. Teddy (Rafe Spall), an apparent serial procrastinator, isn’t doomed to repeat the same day forever. Instead he’s racing through time, jumping forward to his next wedding anniversary, every few minutes. This “gift” – given to him by a mysterious stranger (Noni Hazlehurst) in a graveyard – shows him the error of his ways. Or, at least, it tells us all about them. In each annual snapshot, Teddy’s new wife Leanne (Zahra Newman) narrates the state of their struggling marriage. The main problem, she says, is that he’s always at work, never making commitments to his home life. But paradoxically, we don’t ever actually see him at work – almost the entire film occurs within their family home. We don’t even know what his job is. This detail gets a winking acknowledgment at the end of the film but it’s a distracting omission, especially when combined with all the sweeping drone shots of this young couple’s beachside property in Bronte. What does this guy do for a living? There’s a similar sense of disconnection with the relationship itself. The film rushes to cover 10 years in 95 minutes, so we get very little introduction to Teddy and Leanne’s life before this point. It’s hard to feel that invested in a crumbling love story when you’ve only seen the couple happy once, on their wedding day. Newman, whom Guardian Australia has previously called “one of Australia’s most remarkable actors”, does a fine job with what little she’s given. Spall has a winsome, manic energy that carries the film’s consistent comedy (although attempts at anything outside that are weirdly mawkish). And Ronny Chieng is a welcome presence, adding his trademark acerbic touch as Teddy’s best friend. With such a small cast – there are only a couple of other actors, including a cameo by Lawson – Long Story Short almost seems like a Covid production: a tiny, tactical shoot to keep the industry going in tough times. But it was actually filmed in the tail-end of 2019. Lawson has explained the film’s scope was so small because of budget constraints. “Getting money for film is really, really tricky so I wrote this primarily indoors with a small amount of actors to really just minimise the budget and try and get this made,” the film-maker told The AU Review. “I was so frustrated I couldn’t make a movie after The Little Death.” (His debut film was another decent comedy showcase that didn’t quite translate to a satisfying whole'.) With that in mind, it’s hard not to imagine a better version of Long Story Short – one that was given a bit more time to develop the dramatic elements of the script and a bit more production money too, at least enough for Teddy to travel beyond a few blocks of his house. Unfortunately we didn’t get that movie and it falls short when compared with the other time-loop romcoms hitting our screens. If you really want to embrace the infinite wisdom of “YOLO”, there are better ways to spend your time this Valentine’s Day. • Long Story Short is in cinemas now	841
There will be sniggering once word gets out about this ridiculous horror film featuring a former kids’ birthday venue/game arcade occupied by evil, life-size animatronic puppets. However, to its credit, the film doesn’t take itself in the slightest bit seriously, because with a premise like that, really how could it? Especially when it has Nicolas Cage, uncharacteristically silent in a dialogue-free role, starring as a bad-ass drifter tricked into spending a night cleaning the haunted premises but proving to be a worthy opponent of the malevolent mechanical creatures. A posse of pesky, academically challenged kids are on hand to be picked off one by one by the bestiary of broken toys, whose leader takes the shape of a sinister weasel named Willy. The great character actor Beth Grant (Mrs Sometimes I Doubt Your Commitment to Sparkle Motion in Donnie Darko) plays the local sheriff who gets to give the big explication monologue about the building’s history, real estate deals and satanic possession. Casting a deep intertextual shadow over proceedings is the spirit of Chuck E Cheese, the string of franchised restaurants featuring oversized mechanical puppets founded in the US in the early 80s that scarred the psyches of people such as Willy’s Wonderland director Kevin Lewis. The parody versions of the songs here are pretty funny, as is Cage’s solemn devotion to his job, down to his insistence that he takes a pinball game break at intervals throughout the film. There’s also something weirdly satisfying about watching him clean the grime off the restaurant, like one of those reality-TV shows in which middle-aged ladies with rubber gloves scrub the homes of hoarders, but with added demons. • Willy’s Wonderland is available on digital platforms from 12 February.	326
It’s the year 2242 and Bruce Willis is still an ageing tough guy who’s kicking butt. That’s the alarming prospect raised by this ropey low-budget sci-fi set aboard a spacecraft carrying 300,000 people from dying Earth to life on a new planet. The plot centres on a parasitic alien chomping its way through the crew hired to keep the vessel ticking over while the passengers cryogenically sleep out the six-month journey. And the film-makers, having borrowed the storyline from Alien, also go for the same blue-collar, boilersuit-wearing, truckers-in-space realism. Willis growls a few lines, half-arses a catchphrase or two and points a gun. The film’s actual lead character is played by Cody Kearsley: Noah, a janitor on this spacecraft, which is the last to leave Earth for the new colony. His heavily pregnant girlfriend is a passenger. (Weirdly, no one seems worried about cryogenically deep-freezing her unborn baby.) Willis plays his hard-drinking boss Clay, though it’s a stretch to call what he does here acting. Security on board is tight following bomb threats from rebels who believe that, having screwed up one planet, humanity don’t deserve another spin of the wheel. It’s a briefly interesting idea, this group of militants trying to stop the spread of parasite humans into outer space, but instead Anti-Life feeds off sci-fi movies past. Enter an alien organism that first appears on screen as a glistening blur accompanied by scuttering on the soundtrack. I’m not sure if it’s still possible after so many Alien copycats to make the spectacle of an alien lifeform exploding out of a human host genuinely scary – and definitely not with the silly effects here. It’s called Anti-Life but it’s definitely not pro film. • Available from 12 February on digital platforms.	345
Shortlists for nine Oscar categories have been unveiled by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (Ampas), an intermediate stage in the thinning-out of films that have qualified for consideration for the Academy Awards. The categories include best documentary, best international film and best song, as well as best live action and documentary shorts. The rules for each voting process vary, but in most categories a preliminary vote from industry specialists in each field is employed to create the shortlist and then the final five nominations, with the full membership of the Academy invited to vote on the winner. The best documentary category sees such high-profile films as Boys State, Crip Camp, Dick Johnson Is Dead and MLK/FBI go forward, along with well-reviewed European productions including Collective (from Romania) and Notturno (from Italy). As expected, the streaming services Netflix and Amazon dominate, scoring three and two entries respectively. However, there was no places for big names such as Frederick Wiseman (City Hall) and and Werner Herzog (Fireball: Visitors from Darker Worlds), nor for popular Netflix documentaries The Social Dilemma and Disclosure. The international feature list, which has been slimmed down from 93 candidates put forward by recognised bodies from individual countries, contains most of the films that have made an impact on the much-reduced festival and specialist-release circuit, including Thomas Vinterberg’s alcohol-fuelled yarn Another Round, Srebrenica massacre drama Quo Vadis, Aida? by the Bosnian director Jasmila Žbanić, and Russian veteran Andrei Konchalovsky’s Dear Comrades!, about a Soviet-era strike crackdown. The best short documentary list includes a film commissioned by the Guardian: Colette, a study of a former French resistance fighter who visits the concentration camp where her brother was murdered, directed by Anthony Giacchino; the BBC adaptation of Julia Donaldson’s The Snail and the Whale makes it into the best short animation list. The Oscars are due to take place on 25 April at the Dolby theatre in Los Angeles.

Not to be mistaken for the Dreamworks film How to Train Your Dragon franchise, here is a reasonably entertaining German family animation based on the 1997 bestseller by children’s author Cornelia Funke. It’s a great-looking film, energetically voiced in English by an A-team of British actors, but seriously let down by unexciting storytelling. Little children, though, may connect to the environmental message. Once upon a time, dragons and humans coexisted in harmony until humans hunted dragons close to extinction. Now the dragons live hidden deep in the rainforest, but deforestation is bringing their old foe ever closer. Among the dragons is young Firedrake (voiced by Thomas Brodie-Sangster), who has an embarrassing problem: he can’t breathe fire. Whenever he tries, only little fart-puffs of smoke come out. To prove his worth, he sets off to find a mythical utopia in the Himalayas, a place where dragons are said to live in peace and safety. Firedrake’s sidekick is feisty chipmunk Sorrell (Felicity Jones), and the pair set off on a predictable quest to find the mythical rim. Not far behind them is villain Nettlebrand, a manmade metal dragon (wonderfully voiced by Patrick Stewart with a sneer of superiority). En route they pick up homeless human teenager Ben (Freddie Highmore), who pretends to be a dragon rider. And here, jarringly, the film-makers drop in a winking reference to their rival franchise: when Firedrake crash-lands into the human city, there is the premiere of film called How to Tame Your Dragon. This movie doesn’t match the first couple of Train Your Dragon films for imagination. Still, it’s got a gag that would never make it into a Hollywood family movie: the first time the kid Ben meets Firedrake, he peers underneath the dragon and asks bemusedly: “You are a male dragon, aren’t you?” • Released on 12 February on Sky Cinema.	370
Adapted from a trilogy of young adult books by Scott K Andrews, that forms part of the “shared world” Afterblight Chronicles series, this gory British boys’ school-set sci-fi posits a deadly virus that swiftly kills almost everyone everywhere except those with a particular blood type. If The Lord of the Flies crossed with The Road and a dash of Tom Brown’s School Days sounds like your bag of blood, than this ruthless romp will be a kick in the head. Director Oliver Milburn, who has made a bunch of horror-themed shorts and one feature (The Harsh Light of Day), has a real knack for staging action and coaxing sincere, punchy performances from his mostly young cast. Much of the story is seen through the eyes of Lee (Oscar Kennedy, actually 22 but babyfaced enough to pass for a teenager), one of the few scholarship boys at St Mark’s, a posh all-male school deep in the English countryside. Busted by the headmaster (Anthony Head, forever Giles from Buffy the Vampire Slayer) for a silly prank, he gets expelled on the same day the UK government starts talking about closing the border to prevent the spread of a deadly virus. Naturally, this fictional UK being true to form, it is already too late; when Lee is left alone he has nowhere else to go but back to St Mark’s. There he finds a few survivors, including his best buddy Mac (Liam Lau Fernandez), a matron not much older than the boys (Jasmine Blackborow) and a few teachers. The survivors start scavenging for food but before long they run afoul of the townies from the well-heeled suburb nearby. Milburn’s screenplay has a streak of dry wit but it never goes for cheap laughs. Instead, it’s a surprisingly bleak and merciless work, judiciously killing off both sympathetic and unlikable characters, including some of the kids and even an unfortunate pet, a line most films are too timid to cross but one that is entirely plausible given the circumstances. Expect more instalments in the franchise if this one takes off. • Available from 15 February on digital platforms.	408
Eammon Ashton-Atkinson’s film about the gay rugby team of which he is a member is not all it seems. The action nominally follows just three days of competition as London’s Kings Cross Steelers – the world’s first out squad, founded in 1995 – take part in the world’s largest LGBTQ+ rugby competition, the Bingham Cup. But this is no normal sports movie. Rather, it’s a gentle, funny and frequently moving exploration of gay identity today. Of how sporting personas are – and are not – affected by sexuality. Of the tensions that can emerge when a group bound by one commonality are driven apart by others. Of what happens to your toes if you spend half your time on the pitch and half – like star player and part-time drag queen Drewalicious – in wincingly tall stilettos. It’s also a thank-you note. Ashton-Atkinson, a teddy bear-ish 34-year-old whose day job is as a journalist for an Australian news channel, joined the club when he moved to London in 2016. It gave him friendship, fulfilment and – eventually – a husband, John. Production was bumpy, to say the least. He only picked up the camera and started shooting after concussion ruled him out of competing in the cup three weeks before. The coach’s big motivational speech scene didn’t get taped as he belatedly found he’d run out of battery. The feelgood result everyone hoped for didn’t quite pan out. Then he accidentally wiped his first version of the film in the edit. Ashton-Atkinson put the rest of the footage in a drawer and forgot about it. What’s the big deal, after all? Gay men and women playing rugby is hardly breaking news – Gareth Thomas came out in 2009 and there are now over 80 LGBTQ+ gay rugby clubs in the UK alone. Then, in April 2019, rugby superstar Israel Folau, a Wallabies and Waratahs full-back, posted a warning on Instagram. “Hell awaits you,” he cautioned homosexuals – as well as drunks, adulterers and atheists and idolators. “Repent!” he added. “Only Jesus saves.” Ashton-Atkinson looked on as the player was sacked, reprimanded and swiftly found employment elsewhere. Folau’s Instagram post remains live. “I just thought: if I was my 13-year-old self seeing his comments, what is the film that that kid would want to see?” And so Steelers came into being: a film in which the stories of key players and their female coach are foregrounded, each speaking about their love of the sport, their acceptance of their sexuality, and how they have sought to link the two. Ashton-Atkinson adds his own coming-out tale. Growing up in late 1990s Australia, he was viciously bullied for his sexuality, then unknowingly filmed while having his first sexual encounter aged 16. The other boy decided to share the footage around school. “I thought, well, this just sums up the whole story of what happened to me when I was growing up. I had to question myself: did that actually happen? Did I make that up?” Ashton-Atkinson feels he is one of many gay people struggling to process the gap between being told they’ve never had it so good but being able to remember a recent time when it was very bad. “Being gay now is celebrated, but for those of us who grew up in that period, we still have these deep scars.” The Steelers generally report finding themselves freed from the burden of identity politics on the pitch: a place where they are simply players. But they are also defined by it, by dint of their club’s identity. They speak of affirming the right to be masculine, or camp, or even both at once. One of the loveliest moments comes when, before a match, the burly blokes all sit down and paint their toenails the club colours: blue and green. “It started off as a practical thing,” says Ashton-Atkinson. “If you paint your toenails and someone stands on it with a stud, the toenail is less likely to crack. But it became a ritual – a hidden or inside joke, saying that we’re all fabulous on the inside as well.” Not all of the players are always on board. The club’s coffers are much increased by the fundraising efforts of Drewalicious’s glorious performances, but older members objected, concerned about perpetuating retrograde stereotypes. Such differences of opinion are good for the mix, thinks Ashton-Atkinson – and the movie. “The club has about 200 active members, and it’s a small microcosm of society. We’re gay and we’re inclusive.” So inclusive, in fact, they now even let straight people play. • Steelers: the World’s First Gay Rugby Club screens at the Glasgow film festival from 26 February to 1 March	935
News comes this week that Nicole Kassell, award-winning director of the dazzling Watchmen TV show, is to oversee a remake of The Wizard of Oz, the classic 1939 musical starring Judy Garland, for New Line Cinema. Well, good luck with that. Myriad film-makers have attempted to recapture the magic of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer’s pioneering movie, but none has really been successful. Sam Raimi is perhaps the most notable recent director to take on the challenge, with Disney’s Oz the Great and Powerful, in 2013. Raimi is an accomplished director of brutally silly cult fantasy films, but his attempt to present a prequel featuring James Franco as the titular wizard lacked sparkle. The 1978 musical The Wiz was intended to capitalise on the popularity of Blaxploitation movies and featured a high-profile, all-black cast including Michael Jackson, Diana Ross and Richard Pryor, with music by Luther Vandross and Quincy Jones. Yet it was a critical and commercial bomb, eventually helping to signal the downfall of the very subgenre it had hoped to propel to greater heights. Studios love to remake classic movies because they come with built-in audience awareness. The original Wizard of Oz is imprinted on our cultural hive memory: the scene in which Judy Garland’s Dorothy emerges from the bland sepia of Kansas into the splendid Technicolor of the magical land of Oz is perhaps equalled only by the one in which Margaret Hamilton’s swivel-eyed, green-skinned Wicked Witch of the West finds herself hideously melting away into nothing. The songs are splendid, and Garland holds the stage as if she really has cast a spell on us. And yet, in 2021, the story feels like a pretty drab, common-or-garden American children’s fantasy. L Frank Baum, who first imagined Oz in his hugely popular 1900 novel, wanted to create a wholesome magic world drained of the spikier elements of European fairy tales and therefore more suitable for conservative US audiences. As he wrote in his original introduction: “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz was written solely to pleasure children today. It aspires to being a modernised fairytale, in which the wonderment and joy are retained and the heart-aches and nightmares are left out.” It’s hard to blame a nation that had barely put the tumultuous “wild west” era to bed for wanting to protect its children from the harsh realities of life, even if the end result was a bloodless, one-dimensional tale. Yet the popularity of modern family films over the past few decades has been based on their appeal to all ages, in many cases because they are a lot more frightening – contain more moments of genuine, terrifying threat – than a good number of R-rated horror flicks. Is there anything scarier in cinema than the scene in Toy Story 3 in which our heroes brace themselves for a fiery demise in the Sunnyside Daycare incinerator? Have we ever been more horrified than when watching Nemo’s mum get eaten by a barracuda as we’ve barely had time to digest the opening credits of Finding Nemo? The problem with Wizard of Oz is that it is all much too hokey to appeal in the modern day. Dorothy’s final realisation that there is “no place like home” is a cheap eulogisation of simple, cosy, country life on a Kansas farm, written by an author who once suggested that his fellow white man would only be safe once all Native Americans were wiped from the face of the Earth. Kassell has a history of working in far icier territory. She made her name with the 2004 thriller The Woodsman, starring Kevin Bacon as a convicted child molester who finds himself tempted back into a life of abuse. It’s an unflinchingly dark and excruciating viewing. Watchmen imagines a bewildering, multilayered alternative future in which the events of the original, seminal Alan Moore graphic novel have unravelled in spectacularly unexpected ways that cleverly mirror the real America’s culture wars. It’s another mature and cultured piece, about as far away from pantomime munchkins and the blimmin’ yellow brick road as one can imagine. Perhaps Kassell is planning an all-growns-up take on the original story, though it’s hard to imagine quite how this would be of any interest. As Raimi discovered to his cost, Oz simply doesn’t boast the sense of looming, gothic horror that permeates earlier, European fantasy tales such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Sleeping Beauty or Beauty and the Beast. For all its pointy-chinned, green-skinned witches and menacing flying monkeys, the story lacks the sense of impending threat that the Grimm Brothers had in spades. Asking Kassell to oversee a fresh remake is a bit like appointing Noam Chomsky to analyse the syntactic brilliance of Mother Goose. In MGM’s classic film adaptation, it is eventually revealed that the titular wonderful wizard is a conman illusionist from Dorothy’s own Kansas. Perhaps it’s time to finally accept that the supposed brilliance of Baum’s original novel is also a simple trick of smoke and mirrors.	943
Any Gen Xers happy to see one more pop culture touchstone bulldozed will appreciate this ambitious but overstuffed fantasy thriller in which Jerry Maguire’s gorgeous poppet Jonathan Lipnicki appears as a murderous autistic chef with an encyclopaedic knowledge of toxins. He plays Sydney, a short-order cook hired by two scions of the fearsome Sinclair clan to dispatch the patriarch August (Timothy V Murphy) at a family dinner. This monster, with a caustic Ulster accent and a grin like a dagger flash, has cut a deal with his children to take custody of his granddaughter Chance (Avery Konrad) so he can inculcate her into the full extent of her powers. The Sinclairs must be invited over the threshold, need daily transfusions of human blood, and sprout tumours after being exposed to too much daylight – so are they vampires? An “oversimplification,” according to Sydney. Beginning with Chance at home and being expelled from school, director Edward Drake tries to ground Broil’s mythology in a more original, domestic setting. But his preamble is off-puttingly cumbersome, full of insinuated but vague backstory that becomes even harder to navigate when the film drops into nested flashbacks and flashforwards to usher in the murder plot. Drake works hard stylistically, but his reagents – Twilight-style young adult and high-gothic horror – threaten never to mix. Eventually, the dinner gives the narrative some focus. From the head of the table, August ferrets out his poisoners and – turning the dial up on a performance that already began close to 10 – organises a set of sadistic after-dinner games in revenge. The power games and grandstanding far more cleanly impart the family’s place within the dark metaphysical backdrop Drake had been awkwardly pinning up behind them. His flair for maintaining a rancorous grand-guignol atmosphere – without resorting to too much gore – hints at a promising future in genre cinema, provided he can keep things simple. • Released on 15 February on digital formats.	364
This extremely low-budget horror film is a lot like a bunch of movies you know – particularly The Blair Witch Project and The Witch, as well as the experimental cinema of Kenneth Anger – but also not quite like anything else. It’s a kind of uniqueness to be treasured, although genre fans may feel frustrated with how slowly the plot reveals itself, its degraded visual style, and its wilful obliqueness. Shot mostly in a snowy forest and a log cabin that writer-director Jordan Graham built himself (he did every job on the film, apart from acting), the film mixes staged scenes with found material. It’s performed mostly by actors but also by Graham’s grandmother June Peterson, who appears to have dementia in real life and whose belief in a supernatural being called Sator who watches over her forms the seed around which Graham has grown the story. Gabriel Nicholson plays June’s withdrawn fictional grandson Adam, who is seemingly disturbed by events long ago; he now lives in the cabin. His obsession with “deer” in the woods is revealed to be a haunting by creepy-looking horned creature-y things that have a way of turning up in a jump cut. Adam’s siblings check up on him, but it becomes clear that this is one screwed-up family. Mixing black and white, low-resolution footage with more colourful material creates a bricolage-like effect that keeps wrong-footing the viewer. Graham uses darkness and a very sparse score/soundscape to create a truly disturbing work that relies not so much on gore as the uncanny in its most potent form: stillness, pools of darkness and just-visible figures. I’ve watched dozens of films at home since lockdown, and this is one of the few I wish I could have seen in a blacked-out cinema. • Sator is available on digital platforms from 15 February.	346
In a 2016 Vanity Fair article, Nancy Jo Sales wrote about prostitution going mainstream, describing a new economy of young people selling their bodies to pay off student loans or just to get by in the tough economic climate. On the same theme, Ben Hozie makes his feature debut with this semi-insightful, uncomfortably funny indie drama about a man who becomes obsessed with an online sex worker. It’s a film with a slackerish mumblecore vibe, and Hozie is refreshingly grown up about sex. But it’s hard to see how his film adds much to the conversation about intimacy in the internet age. It’s set in the self-consciously hip New York art scene where Jack (Peter Vack) calls himself a professional gambler; though watching him max out his credit cards playing internet blackjack it’s obvious that he’s hooked. His other addiction is cam-girls – women who perform sex acts in front of a webcam for money. Jack spends a fortune tipping his favourite, dominatrix Scarlet (Julia Fox); she calls him her slave and in a funny-excruciating scene virtually stubs her cigarette out on his tongue. What’s clever about the script is that Jack isn’t some “incel” creep who can’t function in the real world. He’s a bit lost, but he’s funny and good-looking (though pallid from all that screen time). An artist ex-girlfriend wants to sleep with him – sex in the real world. But Jack prefers it virtually. About halfway in the perspective flips to Scarlet, played with super-sexy charisma by Fox (who was Adam Sandler’s girlfriend in Uncut Gems and worked as a dominatrix in real life). There is no question of slut-shaming Scarlet – being a sex worker is her choice. But she’s a disappointing character: empty-headed and, away from the webcam, a doormat to her slimy playwright boyfriend. This film is not nearly so edgy as it thinks it is. • Pvt Chat is available on digital platforms from 12 February.	387
To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before, an unfailingly sweet update on a John Hughes movie about a Korean-American high school girl whose old love letters are accidentally delivered, was arguably the most successful of Netflix’s 2018 romcom revival (which included less effective but still popular films such as Set It Up, Someone Great, Always Be My Maybe and The Kissing Booth). The film launched homegrown stars in Lana Condor and Noah Centineo, whose irresistible chemistry made it a beguiling streamer’s loop; it’s one of the few films I rewatched immediately, then rewatched again, then popped in and out of my favorite scenes for weeks. Happily ever afters do not resolve when there’s so much money and attention at stake, and the saga of Lara Jean Song Covey (Condor) and Peter Kavinsky (Centineo) continues in two sequels filmed back-to-back, both based on the YA hits by Jenny Han (who adapted the screenplay with Katie Lovejoy). The first, To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before: PS I Still Love You, premiered almost exactly a year ago. The second, Always and Forever, originally slated for late last year, arrives on 12 February. There’s been some, um, developments in between those premiere dates, which will either heighten your escapist craving or distract from the film’s fantasized timeline (it’s set in spring 2021, yet there’s no masks in sight). But where the second movie faltered by setting up a too-hastily sketched, unconvincing love triangle, Always and Forever corrects course by re-centering the series’ initial hook: the palpable spark between overthinking Lara Jean and ever-charming Peter, who still looks at Lara Jean like … if you’ve seen the first, you know. It’s an enjoyable if sometimes overwrought return to form, as its central pair are buffeted by a sanitized though still thorny college admissions process. Always and Forever, directed by Michael Fimognari (who also helmed PS I Still Love You; the first film was directed by Susan Johnson), picks up weeks after the second movie left off: Lara Jean and Peter are back together and inseparable, FaceTiming I love yous from Portland and the Coveys’ spring break in Seoul. (Lara Jean’s Korean heritage – unfortunately, groundbreaking in 2018 – is once again treated sensitively here, an important aspect of her life but not the only one). Lara Jean, ever the fantasist, has a life plan, played out in succinct daydream: get into Stanford with Peter, get married to Peter, have a baby and a house with Peter, write a bestselling book with Peter. The lurch, of course, is that Lara Jean does not get into Stanford (Peter is going for lacrosse); the rejection sends her into a tailspin of anxiety about the future (the film has a solid grasp on how terrifying that murkiness can be at 17) and disrupts her too-twee vision – “we were supposed to hold hands while riding bikes, and play footsie in the library, and wear tree hats to football games,” she cries to her younger sister Kitty (Anna Cathcart, still reliable comic relief) and best friend Chris (Madeleine Arthur). The crush of denial from an elite school is a bit laughably non-universal but the film treats it as it feels for Lara Jean and Peter’s sliver of American high schoolers: life-ending or affirming. The rest of the movie spins from (very teenage) bad communication exacerbated by uncertainty. On a class trip to New York City, Lara Jean falls in love, believably, with NYU and an unexpected vision of her future. To All The Boys smartly makes Peter as understanding as possible (Centineo still has it) but the prospect of growing 3,000 miles apart fractures their fragile romance novel idea of coupledom. Condor, ever the series ace, delivers another nuanced performance, but the film lags as it prizes Lara Jean’s anxiety around the marks of their relationship – gifts, matching shirts, lots of LJ &lt;3 PK notes – over the lived-in banter that sizzled in the original. Still, Always and Forever continues the sequel’s few high notes: the supportive stepfamily formed between Dr Covey (John Corbett) and neighbor Trina (Sarayu Blue); Peter and Lara Jean’s bond over a lost parent; and layers to former romantic rival/one-dimensional bitch Gen (Emilija Baranac). It coasts in part on montaged nostalgia for the first film, partly on the trilogy’s solid grasp of how monumental every teenage emotion feels, which makes the sideplot over whether/when/how Peter and Lara Jean have sex, resolved with Disney-esque modesty and brevity, land better than it should. Plans fail, but young love prevails, of course – the film wraps things up with a swoon, effectively pulling at the nostalgic heartstrings. The final serving of this three-part confection rarely strays from enjoyable, even if it doesn’t match the seductive sweetness of the first bite. To All the Boys: Always and Forever is available on Netflix from 12 February	974
American actor Shia LaBeouf’s legal team has denied allegations of sexual battery and assault made by his former girlfriend, British musician FKA twigs, in a civil lawsuit last year. LaBeouf’s attorney said in a court filing that the actor “denies generally and specifically each and every allegation” in the complaint. The court document, filed on 5 February and made available to Reuters on Thursday, also states that the singer’s allegation of sexual battery was invalid “because none of the acts alleged were based on sex.” The civil lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles superior court in December under her real name Tahliah Barnett, sought unspecified damages for alleged sexual battery, assault and emotional distress. Barnett also accused LaBeouf of emotional abuse during their year-long relationship in 2019. The lawsuit states that in February 2019 Barnett was a passenger in a vehicle that LaBeouf was driving recklessly, and that he removed his seatbelt and threatened to crash unless she said she loved him. The pair had taken a trip to the desert outside Los Angeles, during which, Barnett alleged, LaBeouf once woke her up in the middle of the night by choking her. LaBeouf, 34, a former child star, is currently undergoing unspecified in-patient treatment, according to a source close to the actor. He had previously issued a general statement apologizing for hurting those around him and citing a history of alcoholism and aggression. In an interview with the New York Times, Barnett, 32, characterised her experience with LaBeouf as “the worst thing I’ve ever been through in the whole of my life” and said she wanted to raise awareness of “the tactics that abusers use to control you and take away your agency”. Responding to detailed allegations about his conduct, LaBeouf told the Times that “many of these allegations are not true” but that he owed Barnett and Karolyn Pho, another woman whose claims feature in the lawsuit, “the opportunity to air their statements publicly and [for me to] accept accountability for those things I have done”. Barnett’s attorney said in a statement on Thursday that LaBeouf’s “legal tact and recovery plan, while not surprising, are poorly misguided self-help strategies.”	421
Fifteen-year-old Lyz (Noée Abita) is on course to become a champion skier. A gifted athlete, she also has the grit, fearlessness and youthful arrogance necessary to rise through the ranks at a training programme in the Alps. In this tense, bone-chilling first feature, French writer-director Charlène Favier looks at how teenage girls are often punished for that boldness. Abita plays Lyz with an air of invincibility that soon curdles into powerlessness as her coach, Fred (Jérémie Renier), begins to scrutinise and prey on her vulnerabilities. He comments on her changing body, pinching her stomach and lecturing her about how “periods are beautiful”. But for every inappropriate remark, there’s welcome praise too. With her mother (Muriel Combeau) off in Marseilles and distracted by a new boyfriend, and her friends more interested in partying, perfectionist Lyz can’t help but crave adult acknowledgment. It’s a vicious cycle: Lyz trains harder, and so Fred intervenes further, treating each win as an invitation to cross another boundary. Favier is smart on the mechanics of abuse, and the sobering inevitability of her heroine’s downhill skid. • On Curzon Home Cinema	223
I worked on many commercials with Rémy Julienne (obituary, 4 February). He “acted” in so many films that he deserved a special Oscar. When actors were not allowed to take part in dangerous driving scenes, he was always the first to step up. “Any fool can crash a car – the trick is to walk away after,” he said. His brilliant team organised for me a seven-car crash on a rain-soaked road (for a commercial for Uniroyal rain tyres directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud). Shot with six cameras, it was perfect – Cut! – then, one hour later, Rémy told me that all the cars were repaired and they were ready for a second take. That was the sort of organisation that made Rémy’s L’Equipe team so valuable to film directors all over the world.	160
This fun and diverting comedy from work wives Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo, who co-wrote 2011’s Bridesmaids, has a silly premise. After being made redundant, culotte-wearing besties Barb (Mumolo) and Star (Wiig) use their severance pay to escape their midwestern hometown for a holiday at the Palm Vista Hotel in Florida. It’s a “middle-aged paradise”, and so Edgar (Jamie Dornan), the young Irish heartthrob they meet at the bar, sticks out like a sore thumb. He’s there on business, involved in a sinister plot involving genetically modified mosquitos. The sci-fi stuff is tedious, but Wiig and Mumolo are bawdy and brilliant as ever, their effortless chemistry bolstered by years of collaboration. As for Dornan, a notably sombre and wooden screen presence in the Fifty Shades of Grey movies, he is required to prance about a sandy beach, participate in several musical numbers and even shake a pair of maracas. He’s an interesting, amusing casting choice, genuinely endearing here as a supervillain’s accomplice and wannabe boyfriend. Comedy, it seems, is a less awkward fit.

“I ain’t never heard of newsreading as a business before.” So says a wide-eyed Fred Hechinger in writer-director Paul Greengrass’s visually expansive yet oddly intimate adaptation of Paulette Jiles’s 2016 novel – a hybrid western that comes on like The Searchers or True Grit bizarrely crossed with Broadcast News. The setting might be post-civil war north Texas, but there’s no mistaking the modern-day parallels as Tom Hanks travels the land, dramatically reading down-to-earth stories from a selection of newspapers and journals. With his avuncular manner and steadfast trustworthiness, he’s an 1870s Walter Cronkite on a horse, spreading the good word with a touch of theatre. Yet this show is almost stolen from Hanks by young German actor Helena Zengel, a mesmerising screen presence who made such an impact in Nora Fingscheidt’s System Crasher, and who here confirms herself as a star in the making. Hanks (who took the title role in Greengrass’s Captain Phillips) plays Jefferson Kyle Kidd, a Confederate captain turned lonely traveller who finds himself reluctantly in charge of 10-year-old Johanna (Zengel). She was taken by the Kiowa people years ago, but is now being returned to her relatives – a German aunt and uncle – after a brutal raid on her adopted tribe. (“This child is an orphan twice over,” says Elizabeth Marvel’s Mrs Gannett.) It’s an assignment Kidd resists, not least because Johanna, who calls herself “Cicada”, speaks no English, eats with her hands, and seems forever to be flitting between fight and flight. Yet recognising that the child needs a protector, Kidd agrees to be her escort, only to discover that he too needs saving, and that she may be his saviour – practically and philosophically. Shot in panoramic vistas by Dariusz Wolski, and played out to the strains of a stirring James Newton Howard score, News of the World cries out to be seen on the big screen. From classic, high-ridge shootouts to an eerie dust storm and the hellscape of Erath (a town run by a Trump/Murdoch-style tyrant who owns both the news and the law), the film evokes the landscape of a mythical odyssey, full of awe and wonderment. Yet even with the lockdown-enforced strictures of a Netflix-only UK release, it still strikes a timely chord, thanks to an empathic script co-written by Lion screenwriter Luke Davies, which inventively addresses the contemporary spectre of truth versus “alternative facts”, alongside issues of racism, exploitation, and newsreading as storytelling. As Kidd, Hanks exudes a Jimmy Stewart-esque blend of sturdiness and sadness, relying on the ever-so-slightly hangdog curl of his lower lip and the camera-friendly glint in his eye to telegraph the pain of his past. “I guess we both have demons to face going down this road,” he tells his young charge, although specifics remain largely unspoken. By contrast, Zengel is a ball of energy, slipping easily between feral screams (shades of Jodie Foster in Nell) and suppressed multilingual speech, subtly suggesting several lives existing within a single soul – a mystery to be appreciated and accepted rather than solved. A conversation between the two about the differing nature of their worldviews (one linear, one cyclical) emphasises the role of language in the creation of “reality”, another nod toward the way that reported news can change the world. Having emerged from news documentaries to become a peerless director of vivid real-life dramas (Bloody Sunday, United 93) and frenetically visceral adventures (the Bourne franchise), Greengrass relishes the opportunity to take a more languorous attitude to character development and location, a quality that seems to have confounded some fans of the director’s more urgent fare. Yet I found this a rewarding and entertaining drama, heavy with the weight of the past, yet buoyed up by the possibilities of the future. News of the World is on Netflix	739
For many years, Australian pop star Sia has hidden behind a fringe that covers her eyes. Using actors instead of starring in her own music videos, she has preferred not to centre herself. Yet her directorial debut appears to draw from her own experiences with addiction; its protagonist Zu (a near-bald Kate Hudson) is a recovering alcoholic. This is confusing, given that the film’s title refers to her non-speaking, neurodivergent younger sister Music (Maddie Ziegler), whose main purpose is to absolve Zu from her troubled past. Ziegler, who appeared on the reality TV show Dance Moms, and features in some of Sia’s best-known videos (including Chandelier and Elastic Heart), is not herself on the autistic spectrum. It’s a problem, especially given the cartoonishness of her portrayal, which sees her gurning, grimacing and mumbling through her scenes. Music uses an augmentative and alternative communication device to translate rudimentary expressions such as “I am happy” and “I am sad”. Her interior world is just as simplistic, conveyed via goofy musical interludes rendered in childlike primary colours and abstract shapes. The lyrics, jaunty platitudes about Music’s “magic mind” and failing body, are offensive too. These self-consciously upbeat moments clash horribly with the wider redemption narrative. Available on multiple VOD platforms from 15 February	255
In its unassuming way, this sparky documentary captures an aspect of modern Paris life at the very moment that it’s becoming obsolete: almost a fragment of the belle époque. Alexandra Pianelli is an artist and film-maker who is working shifts at a newspaper kiosk in Paris, which is run by her mum and which was once run by her grandparents and great-grandparents before that. With a headcam, she films the regular customers who come in to buy their papers and magazines and generally chat and flirt with Pianelli – her camera records their faces, and she also sketches them and creates witty little models and stop-motion animation sequences to show what life is like in her kiosk. Things are tough. A distribution strike reduces the number of papers they have to sell but their overheads remain the same. An old-fashioned clippings research agency goes bust owing them €30,000, which they will never see. A demo on the street results in better sales one day, but their eyes are stinging from the teargas. Unlike British cornershops selling papers, the kiosk can’t diversify into fruit, veg and convenience-store sandwiches. And, of course, most importantly, the internet is killing print – the kiosk’s bread and butter. Pianelli’s mum is seriously considering retirement and letting the kiosk be dismantled (and we are entitled to suspect that the film-maker knew perfectly well from the outset that this retirement is a certainty, and would provide her with a bittersweet ending). We in fact only glimpse Pianelli herself a couple of times – but her headcam is clearly an icebreaker for the regulars who cheerfully play up, now that they know what she is doing. This is a very sweet, charming film and there is something high-minded and even innocent about this little island of print journalism. • The Kiosk is released on 19 February on True Story.	349
The anger and despair in this Romanian filmed theatre work are kept in check by its ice-cold manner: it is spoken throughout in the kind of deadened official style that Ceaușescu-era apparatchiks might have used for reports on wrongdoers and dissidents, and the style that these same people might have used to defend themselves, and convince their political masters that they had internalised the right kind of torpid, soulless submission. Director Radu Jude (who made the much-admired I Do Not Care If We Go Down in History as Barbarians) has adapted a verbatim-theatre stage play by Gianina Cărbunariu, working with the writer herself; it chillingly dramatises an actual 1981 Securitate case file concerning a high school student called Mugur Călinescu. This teenager was discovered to be chalking protest slogans on walls (in scandalously large “uppercase print” letters) calling for an end to poverty and for free trade unions of the sort permitted by Romania’s ally Poland. To discover and punish the author of these innocuous sentiments, hundreds of informants were mobilised, phones bugged, schoolchildren bullied into turning snitch – all with coldly fanatical pettiness. Mugur (here played in reconstructions by Şerban Lazarovici), his mother (Ioana Iacob) and estranged father (Serban Pavlu) were all called in for questioning and threatened; his teachers lost their nerve en masse and denounced the boy – who died some years later in suspicious circumstances. The resulting monologue and dialogue scenes are taken from the various enforced “statements” and bugged conversations, but these scenes are interspersed with eerily bland TV footage and propaganda newsreels showing happy Romanians under Ceaușescu’s rule. Fridge manufacturers receive awards, folk dancers cavort in the city streets and a would-be escaper sorrowfully reveals in an interview how he was ejected from a detention camp in Austria, the moral being the westerners don’t want you, so don’t even think about it. It is chilling when you see Mugur at first: a closeup right up to the camera lens, the blank face scoured of emotion. This is how people have learned to live and survive, it is the lingua franca for both the oppressor and oppressed, and the reconstructions give us a window on lives lived under tyranny. When Mugur’s dad chillingly warns him that the Securitate might be on his case for the next 10 years, it is no satisfaction for us in 2021 to realise that Nicolae and Elena Ceaușescu will be shot dead before that time is up. This is a long film, and some might think it has made its point a while before the closing credits have arrived. But it is a fierce and impassioned denunciation of evil, part of a continuing wave of Romanian film-making dealing with the Ceaușescu and post-Ceaușescu eras. I incidentally repeat my plea for some Romanian director to collaborate with Peter Morgan to make a film about Ceaușescu coming to the UK in 1978 to meet the Queen and get his honorary knighthood. • Uppercase Print is released on 17 February on Mubi.	559
Its plot featuring a giant mining corporation known as “the monster” tearing up the landscape and causing bitter division among the hard-drinking local populace, this handsomely shot drama could be taking place in rust-belt America. But this is backwoods Greece, where forest rancher Nikitas (Vangelis Mourikis), first seen fending off a landslide caused by the miners’ activities, is fighting a running battle to keep them from despoiling the haven he loves. A motorbike throttle at midnight announces the arrival of his estranged son Johnny (Argyris Pandazaras), whose need to claim his inheritance adds to the pressure on Nikitas to ship out. With this father-son conflict, and a liking for contemporary imagery like Johnny’s motocross track to liven up the classicism, director Georgis Grigorakis in his feature debut makes a claim on the same kind of romantic-realist territory as Jacques Audiard. Father and son are forced to cohabit in Nikitas’s forest cabin; their feuding starts small – he tries to make Johnny wear slippers inside – but gradually becomes inflamed by past grievances. Mourikis, looking like a skulking Leonard Cohen, coolly underplays the resentment and regrets until they explode at the corporate lackeys, like when they cut down his walnut tree. It’s a shame that, as it ramps up, this generational tension isn’t dramatised with the sharpness it might have been. Johnny is more thinly drawn, leaving Digger over-reliant on Nikitas’s selfish idealism – and some occasionally on-the-nose scenes revolving around it. Luckily, Grigorakis’ breakdown of the town’s factions is more subtle. And he and cinematographer Giorgos Karvelas not only have an eye for striking visuals, but they know how to use them in amplifying counterpoint: the forest dells are filmed with the protective intimacy Nikitas feels for them, as against the shock and awe of the mining excavator’s behemoth teeth. A bracing backdrop for a world-weary but engaging film. Released on 16 February on Mubi.	367
If you don’t want to read spoilers about the new Spider-Man movie, stop reading now. I didn’t want to read spoilers about the new Spider-Man movie either, but such information has become impossible to avoid on social media. Snippets and scoops about big new movies course through the internet, making their way up the food chain to mainstream outlets (like this one, sorry). As a result, we now find ourselves getting spoilers about movies before they’re even made. Recent Spider-Man developments illustrate just how absurd things have become. First came rumours – spoiler alert! – that alongside Spider-Man laureate Tom Holland, the latest movie will pull a meta-storytelling flourish by bringing back former Spider-Men Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire. That would have been a great surprise, except now it’s not a surprise. Again, sorry. The rumour solidified last week when, randomly following up a thing she’d read on TikTok, @daisyjediridley found a tweet from late January from a guy saying he’d just delivered food to Andrew Garfield (and he was “rude asf”). The delivery guy’s location? Atlanta. And what’s filming in Atlanta? The new Spider-Man! Boom! Not to say this proves the Garfield/Maguire cameo is true (and many defended Garfield as “not rude asf”), but it speaks of the dedicated army of amateur sleuths out there, patrolling the web, sharing knowledge, piecing it all together. Studios have always encouraged a certain amount of cat-and-mouse with fans when it comes to secrecy. They don’t want anyone spoiling their surprises, but a steady trickle of advance information is handy marketing. The fans seem to be winning this game, however. Put out an anonymised casting call and they’ll figure out what it’s for (Spider-Man was “The November Project”). Do a location shoot and illicit images will be up on Twitter before you’ve wrapped. Those images are then crowd-analysed and cross-referenced with clues from interviews (“Zendaya teases aliens in Spider-Man 3?”), Instagram accounts, leaked scripts, tie-in Lego kits, you name it. Bellingcat has got nothing on these folks. Perhaps in counter-reaction, we have seen another trend recently: the secret movie. The aforementioned Spider-Man’s Zendaya, for example, is currently to be found alongside John David Washington in Malcolm &amp; Marie, an artful little two-hander shot in secrecy during the summer lockdown then dropped on Netflix with little fanfare, like a Taylor Swift album. Perhaps we’ll see more like it, but such secrecy is now impossible with big movies. It’s not just Spider-Man; you’ll find these kind of pre-spoilers for The Batman, Thor: Love And Thunder and Mission: Impossible. It’s enough to make you want to turn off the internet, at least for a while. When Spider-Man finally does come out, you just know some people will be like, “Yawn. Knew that was going to happen.” We often complain about predictability in big movies, but right now we seem hell bent on eradicating surprise. Fan curiosity is a great thing, but it shouldn’t be an end in itself. There’s a point at which advance knowledge tips over from enhancing a movie to detracting from it.	639
You might find enough giggles in this stupendously silly coming-of-age horror to keep yourself amused. But, honestly, it’s not really funny enough to be enjoyably bad – even with a bizarro erotic storyline involving humans and fish. It stars Ema Horvath (who, it’s fair to say, looks pretty uncomfortable) as 16-year-old Liberty, back from summer camp to find that her mum, Michelle (Mena Suvari), has installed a young new boyfriend in their home. He is superhunk John, an aquatic geneticist played by Trey Tucker, whose wooden acting I doubt would make the grade in a porn film. Embarrassingly, Liberty can’t hide the fact that she has a massive crush on John. Worse, he creepily stares at her while making out with her mum in the kitchen – and walks around the house naked. Director Braden R Duemmler creates zero tension in these moments. Is there an erotic frisson between Liberty and John? Or does his behaviour amount to grooming? Through all of this, mum Michelle is clueless and poor Suvari has nothing to do but drool over John, and pant terrible cougar-ish lines like: “I’m riding him constantly.” As it happens, the question about which lucky lady has the keys to John’s heart melts away when he is seen – a la Troy McClure – pervily eyeing up specimens in the tank in the basement; fish are his one true love. “You’re kind of a weird dude,” says Liberty, underplaying the freaky plot twist. To prepare you for that, there’s a mad scene in which Liberty gets her period in a rowing boat with John – who leans over and licks the blood, a peculiar quiver passing over his face. The denouement when it comes is meant to be shriek of pure sci-fi horror; but really, you’d find better entertainment – and more energetic acting – watching a fish tank. • Released on 22 February on digital platforms.	378
British-Nigerian director Joseph Adesunloye’s feature debut – made in 2016 but only now seeing the light of day – is the story of a London photographer travelling to Senegal for his father’s funeral. It’s a drifting movie, not entirely successful but grounded by the undeniable screen presence of boxer turned model turned actor Dudley O’Shaughnessy. (He was in the recent season of Top Boy; in his modelling days he appeared opposite Rihanna in the video for We Found Love.) Here he plays Leke, a fashion photographer living the dream in Hackney; home is a loft-style flat overlooking the city and Leke is about to open a major show in China. The film begins with a couple of fake-feeling gallery scenes, everyone head-to-toe in black and air-kissing with extravagant mwah-mwahs (this is the art world recognisable from other movies rather than real life). Despite his success, Leke seems detached from his life in London. He is also ignoring telephone messages from Senegal, where his father is seriously ill. When the inevitable call comes – his dad has died – Leke flies to Dakar. A family friend has arranged for a taxi driver to be his guide. “What do you speak? French? Wolof?” Leke shakes his head no. “Mon ami,” says the guy. “Tu est perdu. You are really, really lost.” Leke zones out, staring out of the taxi window. But Dakar switches him on; he photographs everything around him and starts seeing beautiful Badewa (Yrsa Daley-Ward). Then, reluctantly, he makes the journey to his dad’s village. Someone alludes to a family rift that is never explained – and the script continues in the same vein, revealing nothing about Leke, his childhood or sense of identity. That reticence is frustrating. But O’Shaughnessy – three parts swagger, two parts tenderness – pulls it along nicely. He’s a talent to watch. • Released on 19 February on Curzon Home Cinema.	381
Here’s a soapy, semi-harrowing wartime drama based on Ruta Sepetys’s bestselling YA novel Between Shades of Gray, about a teenage girl deported to a Soviet gulag. The book was written for teenagers but discovered by adults; the issue for the movie seems to be uncertainty about which audience is the target. It’s a sometimes hard-hitting, always heartfelt film – and star Bel Powley is an actor with an umami-style knack for adding depth to any film she’s in. But cynical viewers over 17 may find themselves rolling their eyes at snogs grabbed outside prison huts. We start in Lithuania in 1941. Powley is 16-year-old Lina, a promising artist whose father, a university professor, is suspected of working against the Soviets. One night the entire family is arrested; Lina, her mum and little brother are loaded onto a cattle car and transported to a prison camp in Siberia. The commander, icily cruel Komarov (Peter Franzén), sentences them to hard labour in unbearable conditions – digging beetroot out of frozen mud day after day with their bare hands. The characters speak mostly English, though Russian lines are in Russian. There’s no other way around the language problem I suppose, but it is distracting; you can never quite forget you’re watching actors in pretend-dirty clothes talking English with eastern European accents. The film’s pace flags a fair amount, but director Marius A Markevicius sensitively shows Lina’s humiliation and horror as a teenager in the camp. Arriving after weeks on a cramped train with no toilets or water, the prisoners are ordered to strip naked for washing. Lina is mortified by the prospect of getting undressed in public, especially since the boy she likes (Jonah Hauer-King), is standing nearby – in true YA style, atrocity and tragedy can only ever be a backdrop to an epic love story. Though to be fair, Markevicius doesn’t flinch from brutality: upsetting scenes showing prisoners being arbitrarily shot dead and an attempted rape scene more than earn the 15 certificate. A war drama with stabilisers. • Released on 19 February on Amazon Prime Video.	405
The 32-year-old D’Innocenzo brothers, Damiano and Fabio, are not newcomers; they shot a feature called Boys Cry in 2018 and made script contributions to many others, including Matteo Garrone’s Dogman. But this is their breakthrough as writer-directors: Favolacce, translated as Bad Tales, which won the Silver Bear award for screenplay at the Berlin film festival last year. It is a superbly shot, viscerally acted ensemble drama of group dysfunction among blue-collar families in the Rome suburbs at the tail end of a sweltering summer. The children prepare to go back to school where a sinister science teacher is to have a catastrophic influence. The ingenious premise is that the narrator has discovered a child’s diary with blank pages and continues the journal in fictional form. This film is the result. The formidable Italian actor Elio Germano plays Bruno, married to Dalila (Barbara Chichiarelli): he is an angry, repressed, gloomy man given to brutish rages and crying jags, who is unsettled by the emotional closeness of his smart kids, Dennis (Tommaso Di Cola) and Alessia (Giulietta Rebeggiani) and by his neighbours. Bruno’s relative financial comfort brings him no happiness but secretly infuriates his friend and neighbour Pietro (Max Malatesta), married to Susanna (Cristina Pellegrino), who is enraged when he has to get his daughter Viola (Giulia Melillo) out of Bruno’s garden pool because she has head lice. When another boy, Geremia (Justin Korovkin), gets measles, his devoted dad Amelio (Gabriel Montesi) eagerly agrees to Susanna’s suggestion that his son should get together with Viola so that she can get her measles out of the way – and Amelio thinks it might be a great way to get Geremia laid. Dennis meanwhile is preoccupied with a pregnant woman called Vilma (Ileana D’Ambra) who may or may not be the means of his sentimental education. These scenes of provincial life are not fairytales exactly; they are more a kind of urban pastoral, with something feral in the behaviour of the men, which mysteriously culminates in tragedy. It’s interesting to put this movie alongside Gianfranco Rosi’s documentary Sacro GRA, an essay-meditation about the people who live on the margins of Rome by the GRA ring road (that is: the Grande Raccordo Anulare). Bad Tales’s dark and painful aspects, and its overwhelming heat, also had me thinking of Ulrich Seidl’s Dog Days, about strange people sunbathing their way through the summer’s hot dullness. • Released on 18 February on Mubi. •This article was amended on 16 February to remove an inaccurate translation of the title.	506
It’s a wonder we got a fourth Indiana Jones film at all. Though the deal struck by Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and Paramount initially agreed to a five-film franchise, the fourth installment seemed unable to escape the purgatory of Hollywood development. Tom Stoppard and M Night Shyamalan, among others, were offered the opportunity to script, while previous titles pitched Henry Jones Jr alongside The City of Gods, The Atomic Ants and even The Son of Indiana Jones. Yet arrive it did, and the franchise is better for it. Crystal Skull isn’t a good film just by dint of existing, nor solely because it’s an Indiana Jones film. It’s good because it carries the same brio that powered the original three films, and parades a wry sense of humour through which Spielberg and Lucas satirise the era in which they grew up. It’s a giddy B-movie which provided pure escapism at a time when blockbusters were rushing headlong into a fog of self-seriousness. The plot sees a world-weary Jones thrust back into saving the world from evil, this time perpetrated by Soviets. Tracing the disappearance of Professor Harold Oxley (the late, great John Hurt), Jones is joined by greaser Mutt (Shia LaBeouf), the prickly counter to Ford’s laconic lead, and later reunited with Raiders of the Lost Ark’s Marion (Karen Allen). With an interdimensional crystal skull as their MacGuffin, the trio traverses the jungle to return it to the mystic city of Akator. Unsurprisingly, Russians are never far behind. The main criticisms levelled at Crystal Skull are ones that afflict many modern blockbusters; namely a sketchy use of CGI and a lingering gaze on the franchise’s future. True, the CGI is far from flawless, but any allusions to Mutt (or Henry Jones III) inheriting the hat and whip from his newly revealed father are more playful than profound. It’s a film set during what would have been a memorable time for both Spielberg and Lucas. Entering adolescence in 1958, their formative years were tangled in the pastiche view of the Soviet Union that the film portrays. There’s something satisfying about two of Hollywood’s most influential creatives caricaturing the pervasive McCarthyite Red Fear that gripped America during the 50s. As such, Cate Blanchett’s scenery-chewing Irina Spalko is perfectly placed, as is Ray Winstone’s lively portrayal of the slippery George “Mac” Michale. While many look at that fridge scene as a 21st-century version of “jumping the shark”, it bookends a tense, pacy opening. You can pick up Spielberg’s glee in quite literally blowing up the “nuclear family” and contrasting America’s postwar prim-and-properness with something much more grim. This lampooning continues into the college bar fight, in which two “tribes” go to war like a scene from West Side Story (a remake of which is Spielberg’s next release, of course). One of the joys of the original Jones films was their simplistic moral compass. Things were cleanly black and white, with Indy struggling for a just cause, and his opponents heavily dabbling in evil. There is a shade more cynicism within Crystal Skull, particularly through the triple-crossing Mac, but the reality is that the film remains clearcut, despite being released into a cinematic landscape where blockbusters had decided upon the moral ambiguity of their protagonists as the central thematic tension. The Dark Knight, Iron Man and Quantum of Solace all premiered in 2008, and centred on characters who fought for “good” in a much murkier way than Jones. Whether it was Tony Stark’s arms-dealing past, or Bruce Wayne’s vigilantism, the blockbuster gloss covered a much more cynical narrative, with an internal tussle over the legitimacy of their actions. Perhaps cinemagoers had grown a bit too jaded – either through experience or familiarity with the new cinematic norm – to fully lose themselves in the Crystal Skull’s unambiguous assessment of right and wrong. But it’s exactly this simplicity and commitment to pure escapism that makes Crystal Skull such a tonic. There’s so much fun to be had with the B-movie glow of man-eating ants and a fencing fight staged atop two speeding jeeps (though I will concede that Mutt’s Tarzan routine is perhaps too far). It’s all very much at home in the cartoon-ish lens which Spielberg uses to send up the FBI, the USSR and the facade of postwar respectability. The film realises it’s a bit silly, and doesn’t carry the same earnestness as The Last Crusade, or force of Raiders of the Lost Ark. But what it does have is an arch sense of humour which carries it through; straight into the arms of Indy 5 … Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is available on CBS All Access in the US and to rent in the UK	930
Shook opens with a smart satirical visual gag. It reveals the cast of characters, a bunch of female online influencers who pimp out various products, arriving at a swanky event, complete with popping flashbulbs. An edit from another angle shows not all is as it seems, which pretty much sets the tone for the rest of the film: a thriller in the stalk-and-slash tradition but one that keeps pulling the rug out from under the viewer’s expectations. After the first gory bit of wrong-footing (literally, it involves a shoe as weapon), blonde beauty specialist Mia (Daisye Tutor) emerges as the main protagonist. After she arrives at her family home in the suburbs to watch cute lapdog Chico for her sister Nicole (Emily Goss) for a few days, it gradually becomes clear that Mia and Nicole’s mother died not so long ago, and that the two sisters have a rancorous relationship, mostly because passive-aggressive Nicole resents flighty, irresponsible Mia for not helping out more when their mother was dying. Seemingly surgically attached to her smartphone, Mia streams updates to her fans, and checks in with other friends across town who keep asking her to come over and party with them. But then the neighbour from across the street (Grant Rosenmeyer) reaches out via text and call, and it becomes clear that he might be a suspect in a string of dog and people murders in the area. Once the danger is established, writer-director Jennifer Harrington gets to work deploying jump scares and reveals that are strictly off-the-shelf generic scary stuff. What makes this a little more interesting is the whole social media/home-surveillance angle, which creates certain interesting challenges to demonstrate what’s going on in different places. Harrington uses simple projections on the scenery to show what’s happening in Mia’s phone; later, there are Zoom-style split-screens with multiple characters watching numbly as horror unfolds. It’s all very 2021, and you can’t help wondering how it will age, but as a launching pad for the director and her cast, it’s a very serviceable platform. Tutor is particularly good at looking terrified, and manages to make the vapid, narcissistic Mia just sympathetic enough that you don’t necessarily want to see her, or cute widdle Chico, get killed. • Released on 18 February on Shudder.	444
This nifty thriller, set mostly in a grand manor house deep in the British countryside, has an impressively evil streak and a clever twist or two that perhaps are not hard to see coming if you’re experienced in the genre. Even so, director Julius Berg, who has worked mostly in French TV and makes his feature debut here, has a knack for ratcheting up suspense and finessing the technicalities in order to maximise the creepiness. For example, the sound design (by Ben Baird) is outstanding, an almost palpable entity that shimmers with synthesiser drones and distorted noises generated by the plot. Elsewhere, when the violence and anxiety reaches its zenith, the film switches aspect ratio to a boxy, nearly square format, heightening the claustrophobia; it’s the sort of thing you might not notice at first but affects the viewing experience in subtle ways. The idea is that three local no-hopers with varying degrees of criminal aspiration plan on burgling the home of Dr Richard and Mrs Ellen Huggins (Sylvester McCoy and Rita Tushingham), a cuddly pair of old dears. Chunky dimwit Terry (Andrew Ellis), the son of the Huggins’s cleaner, has heard they’ve got a huge stash of cash and valuables in the house, and has tipped off his harder, meaner friend Nathan (Ian Kenny) – who has brought along even nastier Gaz (Jake Curran, sporting a truly evil mullet and white dreadlock hairdo). But the sudden appearance of Nathan’s girlfriend, Mary (Maisie Williams), annoyed because Nathan has taken her car and she needs to get to work, throws the plan off kilter, as does the unexpected return of the owners of the property. The young cast are pretty good, but seasoned players McCoy and Tushingham are the real scene stealers, especially Tushingham with those still-wondrous marble blue eyes, just as mesmerising as they were back in the day when she was a British It girl, starring in A Taste of Honey and The Knack … and How to Get It. • Available from 22 February on digital platforms.	396
Here is another one of those horror flicks where young people on holiday in rural places are terrorised by crazed degenerates. Even if Butchers is more preoccupied with paying homage to its slasher ancestors than carving out its own turf, the opening scene is atmospheric enough. Against the icy canvas of a snow-covered graveyard, two brothers, Owen (Simon Phillips) and Oswald (Michael Swatton), are burying their mother: the occasion is solemn as Owen delivers a half-hearted two-sentence eulogy. But things kick off when they glimpse a car breaking down, and straight away we are into gore as the brothers ambush and brutally terrorise their first victims. Unfortunately, Butchers struggles to keep up this momentum after the film cuts to two 20-something couples speeding through this cursed terrain. (The brothers are not professional butchers but rather hobbyists with a makeshift slaughterhouse.) These young city folks are eminently dislikable – two of them are hooking up and cheating on their respective partners – yet none of these details helps flesh them out, nor encourage much sympathy at their gory demise. Backwoods killers are a common enough device, but Butchers takes the odd decision to have its Canadian killers speak with a southern drawl à la Texas Chainsaw Massacre, an intentional incongruity that doesn’t really work. Heavy-handed sound effects don’t help, either. Nevertheless, despite the meandering script, it’s Phillips’ performance that keeps the film’s pulse going. His Owen is exhilaratingly unpredictable, alternating between moments of meticulous villainy and sheer lunacy – one moment he will be refitting a spooky music box while eyeing his oblivious prey, next he will be whacking his victim bloodily, channelling a kind of biblical righteousness that makes him slippery, fascinating and, most importantly, terrifying to watch. Despite Phillips’ cleaver-wielding swagger, however, Butchers is pretty much dead meat, an amalgam of worn-out tropes unsuccessfully zombified to life. • Released on 22 February on digital platforms.	367
Small, imperfectly formed but quite entertaining all the same, this wacky sci-fi-adjacent feature stars Joe Manganiello (from the Magic Mike movies and, let’s not forget, Smurfs: The Lost Village) as an intense, homeless man with a cut torso who calls himself Max Fist. Max has a taste for hooch and crystal meth but also claims to be a super powerful fighter for justice from a parallel universe – a realm that just so happens to be accessible through an abandoned shopping mall in grotty Edge City where the action is set. While all that unfolds in a real enough looking US city, shot on film stock, the stories Max narrates about his previous life in the other universe are illustrated with some groovy looking animation and a mix of stylised drawings and computer renderings, mostly in a hypersaturated palette of electric blue and magenta pink. This colour scheme persists throughout, cropping up in the live-action sequences, too, giving the whole film a pop art, candy-coloured artificiality that’s pleasingly retro. The film’s other heroes, a teenager named Hamster (Skylan Brooks) and his tough older sister Indigo (Zolee Griggs) feel drawn very much from a 21st-century gallery of archetypes, what with Hamster aspiring to make it big as an influencer online while Indigo is breaking through the glass ceiling as a female drug dealer, working for a local thug known only as the Manager (Glenn Howerton, hamming it up amusingly). Writer-director Adam Egypt Mortimer moves seamlessly between the two registers, although, in truth, the last act feels breathless and rushed. Mumblecore star Amy Seimetz (Upstream Color) makes it all worthwhile with a turn that doesn’t get that much screen time but leaves a huge impression. • Released on 22 February on digital platforms.	337
A critic ought to tread carefully when reaching for a word like “indescribable”; those kinds of adjectives can put us out of a job. If you can’t describe it, what’s your purpose? Yet that word is one of the best ways to characterise the elusive, amazing qualities of works produced by the world-renowned Bangarra Dance Theatre, the subject of an exquisite new documentary directed with a fittingly rhythmic sense of motion and movement by Wayne Blair (The Sapphires, Top End Wedding, Cleverman) and Nel Minchin (Matilda &amp; Me, Making Muriel). The company was founded in 1989 and has put on more than two dozen productions, as well as the exhilaratingly original 2015 dance movie Spear, which I argue was one of the most significant Australian films from the previous decade. As we learn in Firestarter: The Story of Bangarra, this narrative is about many things: brotherhood, performance and virtuosity, intergenerational trauma. It is also a revision of Australian history that, like NITV’s You Are Here series and to lesser extent SBS’s Australia in Colour, challenges Judeo-Christian dominance with a focus on Indigenous perspectives. Dance is inseparable from Bangarra, of course; Bangarra is inseparable from Indigenous culture, and Indigenous culture is inseparable from the history of a land now called Australia. Because of this relationship between dance and country, the film is always a hair’s breadth from giving us a movement, a contortion, a twist of the body: something to comment on the complexities of human experience in ways that profoundly rearrange the context in which we ordinarily do so. Many interesting talking points are raised throughout. Reviewers once criticised Bangarra for fusing contemporary and traditional elements (says Stephen Page, “They wanted us to do the token old work; they didn’t want to see us moving into the millennium”). There was the massive task of preparing for the Sydney Olympics opening ceremony, leading to a spectacular result. There is also – at the heart of Bangarra story – tragic elements involving the Page family best left for the film to reflect on. Early in the piece we see home footage of the Page family including the kids performing, playing dress-ups and gallivanting around. We also see footage of Tent Embassy protests from 1972 (for more on this subject, consult the electrifying 1972 documentary Ningla A-Na) and a 1982 news bulletin reporting on how Queensland back then was the only state in Australia that still had “one law for whites and another for blacks”. Except that reportage is incorrect, because it doesn’t acknowledge the existence of Indigenous laws. The difference between Indigenous and colonial laws was the subject of the 1982 documentary Two Laws, and has been explored in films including High Ground and the TV series Mystery Road. In terms of Bangarra’s stage productions, there are snippets of various works over the years, including – to name a few – Fish (those lovely aquatic colours!), Rites (the rich reddy-orange lighting!), Blak (those vertical rows of burning spotlights!) and Bennelong (that huge circle suspended in the air!). The magic of the stage, however, cannot be captured on the screen – especially not for works like Bangarra’s, which do not descend from the same lineage that informs much of western culture, such as Aristotle’s highly influential Poetics, emphasising elements that include plot and dialogue. Movies are mausoleums: fossilised representations of the past that embalm actors and subjects who (given that the art form originated in the late 19th century) are now more likely to be dead than alive: a collection of ghosts emblazoned through light and shadow. Theatre on the other hand, which thrums with life, has to be ephemeral; it has to be of and for the moment. Attempting to capture that is like trying to store lightning in a bottle. Blair and Minchin know this, lacing Firestarter with moments of performance but doing so with an understanding of the strengths and limitations of the documentary format. They create a beguiling kind of history lesson and an engrossing, fast-moving celebration of artistic creation, among many other things. In the age of virtual and augmented realities, it probably won’t be long before the Bangarra dancers will appear, life-sized, in our living rooms, moving through our space, in all their majesty and beauty and spirit and strength, once again bringing songlines and subterranean connections, combining old and new in the most sublime ways. My initial inclination was to write “until then, watch Firestarter” – but I am sure we will want to watch this film then too. The fact that the story of Bangarra is (hopefully) far from finished in a strange way almost adds to the film, implying – not ephemerality, exactly, but a sort of true-to-life incompleteness. What an experience. What a joy. I’ve watched it twice, and on both occasions emerged deeply moved. • Firestarter: The Story of Bangarra is in cinemas around Australia from 18 February	964
Here’s a slightly more upscale contribution to the deluge of feature-length football documentaries that have flooded our screens in the last few years. Pelé is the apex talent who underpinned Brazil’s rise to unquenchable glory in the 1960s, culminating in the epic 1970 victory over Italy in the World Cup final – itself crowned by the endlessly replayed Carlos Alberto goal set up by Pelé’s cute lay-off: the cherry on the icing of the cake of football’s golden age. In truth, Pelé is’s stardom was partly founded on his smiley, boy-next-door persona and he is a fundamentally undramatic figure – certainly compared to the chaotic lord-of-misrule that was Diego Maradona, his only serious rival in the greatest-of-all-time stakes. Consequently, this admiring profile is considerably more sedate than Asif Kapadia’s rollicking biography of Maradona, though benefiting from an extensive interview with Pelé, who is now unable to walk without assistance. While Pelé’s footballing feats – inspiring Brazil to three World Cup wins, spending almost his entire career knocking in more than 1,000 goals for the same small Brazilian club, a brief foray to New York in the mid-70s – may seem to belong to ancient history, there’s a comfort-blanket familiarity about running through them once again. Where this film does turn up interesting material is by filling in the context of Brazil’s turbulent history in the 60s and highlighting Pelé’s participation in legitimising the military coup. Pelé maintains his ingenuous stance was entirely non-political, but there is a degree of bitterness on show from contemporaries who didn’t have his celebrity privilege. And it’s eye-opening to see the tensions preceding the 1970 World Cup, given Brazil’s triumph, seemed pre-ordained. But Pelé still possesses plenty of untarnished lustre as, arguably, the world’s first black sporting superstar, and the gold standard for footballing achievement for decades. (The Viagra ads he did at the turn of the millennium somehow don’t get a mention.) This valedictory film allows sober recognition for all that he did. • Available from 23 February on Netflix.	397
As the lead turn in this burb-midlife crisis dramedy, Wendi McLendon-Covey repeatedly does a facial expression which can best be called stunned-discontentment-and-incredulity. It is, if nothing else, appropriate for the very eventful script from writer-director Debra Eisenstadt, that packs in loads of ideas and situations, and brings us to a series of contrived seriocomic crises, after which the dramatic temperature is reset to normal in the succeeding scene. At one stage McLendon-Covey’s character gets hit by a car, and simply limps away with the same satirically grumpy face and a bruise to show for it. It’s not totally clear if the surreal effect is intentional. McLendon-Covey plays Cathy, a woman who is bored and unfulfilled in her uptight marriage to Matthew (Steve Little, the dorky teacher Stevie Janowski from TV’s Eastbound &amp; Down) and anxious about her relationship with her teen daughter Tara – a very good performance from Kate Alberts. When she goes cat sitting for her querulous sister Gail (Catherine Curtin), Cathy finds herself fascinated by Gail’s dodgy neighbours: substance abuser Gemma Jean (Christine Woods), her husband Paul (Graham Sibley) and their teen son Xander (Max Burkholder). Gemma Jean shares inappropriately with Cathy, and both Paul and Xander seem attracted to her. Blush plays out along the classic American Beauty lines: menopausal sexual adventure for the grownups in ironic parallel with a disruptive emotional awakening for the teens a generation below. Tara even does an outrageously sexy group dance on the high-school stage which is taken straight from the Oscar-winning film. Matthew seems entirely enraptured by this, incidentally – odd, considering how cross he is later about Tara’s apparent relationship with a much older boy. In the end, this movie doesn’t really go anywhere or do anything. • Released on 22 February on digital platforms.	350
The unbearable grief of losing a child is a difficult subject for any movie to encompass – and it defeats this decently acted but syrupy, glib drama about the early married life of movie star Patricia Neal and children’s author Roald Dahl, whose seven-year-old daughter Olivia died in 1962 of encephalitis due to measles. Despite the best intentions, To Olivia winds up creating a carpet of eggshells for its audience to walk across. The film suggests the family were brought closer together by this catastrophe, resulting in Neal gaining new emotional intelligence for her acting and Dahl being able to accept creative comments on his work from his family, and so getting crucial improvements for his 1964 hit Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Maybe – or perhaps Olivia’s death was an agony that everyone simply had to live with and live through, and one that may have accelerated Dahl’s existing slide towards cantankerous bigotry. It did have one actual result: Dahl later became a powerful campaigner for vaccination. In 1962, there was no vaccine for measles, a fact mentioned in the postscript. (Maybe it is not too late to enlist Dahl’s support against the insidious anti-vaxxers: every Dahl book or movie should come displayed with Dahl’s vaccination message.) Keeley Hawes plays Neal, the glamorous star content to live in a rambling house in the chilly English countryside, cheerfully putting up with her moody and mercurial husband, who indulges the children with flights of fancy when he’s not grumpily putting away the scotch in his writing den. Dahl is affectionately played by Hugh Bonneville, and inevitably makes Dahl more attractive and personable than was the case. Then the unspeakable tragedy happens; Dahl retreats into misery, unable even to say Olivia’s name, and the increasingly lonely and alienated Neal fatefully decides to head out to Hollywood to act in the western drama Hud, opposite Paul Newman. This film comes to life in the two scenes when its hushed note of kindly reverence is broken. Neal and Dahl go for spiritual succour to his old headteacher, Geoffrey Fisher, the archbishop of Canterbury – fiercely played by Geoffrey Palmer in his final film role. Fisher’s blithering, pompous nonsense about animals not being allowed in the kingdom of heaven enrages them both. Then later, when Neal meets Newman (Sam Heughan), he coolly declines to engage in the ashen-faced condolences. There is no real howl of pain of the kind that we had in, say in the 1993 movie, Shadowlands about the personal grief of CS Lewis. To Olivia is cushioned by its own carefully managed good taste. • Released on 19 February on Sky Cinema.	502
A sulphur-whiff of evil rises from this exquisitely nasty and horribly watchable thriller from writer-director J Blakeson, whose debut movie The Disappearance of Alice Creed 12 years ago gave us all grounds for predicting great things. And Rosamund Pike is tremendous, giving us her most outrageous Hitchcock-blonde turn since Gone Girl. Pike offers a window display of pure predatory wickedness, lighting up the screen with her sociopath haircut, shades and fashion-plate outfits, like Nurse Ratched’s aspirational granddaughter. She is also vaping – always the sign of a screen villain. Although I can’t help wishing Blakeson could have given Pike’s co-star Dianne Wiest more to do in the final act, it is grisly and gleefully cynical entertainment. If Ben Jonson directed films, they would be like this. Pike plays Marla Grayson, a ruthless woman who, with her assistant-lover Fran (Eiza González), is exploiting a goldmine of neglect. Elder abuse and the fear of dementia are growth industries, and this movie hits on the most painful subject of all: not being able to see your mum or dad in a care home. Marla bribes doctors to give phoney dementia diagnoses for well-off elderly patients with no family members in the picture. The doctor applies for an emergency court order to have this now terrified old person placed under the tender care of Marla, as a state-appointed guardian with discretionary charge of that person’s finances. While the aged victim is sedated and imprisoned in a care home, with no visitors allowed, Marla is entitled to drain their bank account and sell their assets to pay the inflated bills charged by the care home in which she owns shares – and she also takes a handsome fee. One day, Marla lands what she thinks is a juicy, tame fish: wealthy Mrs Peterson, marvellously played by Wiest. But Marla doesn’t realise Mrs Peterson has connections with a vindictive Russian mafioso, played by Peter Dinklage. If the Coen brothers were shooting this, they would maybe dial up the bizarre black humour, though at the cost of losing out on the very real chill of cruelty. Steven Soderbergh might well have filmed it too; it’s not a million miles away from movies such as 2013’s Side Effects or Unsane from 2018, though again he might have taken a breezier line with the film’s unspeakably horrible high concept. Blakeson plays it very straight – until the end, when an element of melodrama creeps in. It pays off in showing us Marla’s black parasitical heart. When Marla turns up at Mrs Peterson’s door, all kindly, sorrowing smiles and with her court order ready to produce at the exact psychological moment, it really is ordeal cinema. We have to sit through this horror, in real time, as Mrs Peterson is at first baffled, then amused, then indignant, then frightened and bewildered, as Marla blandly shows her the paperwork and then gestures at the cops who are waiting in case she doesn’t come quietly to the care home. There is something all too plausible about poor Mrs Peterson’s grimly trusting belief that if she submits to being locked up now, this whole mistake can be rectified later. We can all imagine that happening to our mum or dad, or ourselves, in the future. It’s impossible to watch this scene without a spasm of anger, an outrage-detonation which powers the movie through almost its entire running time. Blakeson and Pike make Marla someone whose clenched, tense, ice-queen mannerisms have evolved through having to face down men who are as evil or more so than her, but less clever. Uncaring is her superpower. • Released on 19 February on Amazon Prime Video.	703
Several past-it tropes from 1990s and 00s teen horror films strut the corridors of high school once more in this debut by director Courtney Paige. In a devoutly Christian small town, local preacher’s daughter Grace Carver (Kaitlyn Bernard) rebels against her conservative community by wearing scarlet lipstick and conducting a strenuously titillating affair with her BFF (very Cruel Intentions). The actual scandal though is her cultish clique, the Sins (very The Craft), founded with six of her naughtiest classmates. The group is so named because each member is reputed to embody a different one of the seven cardinal vices. Flirtatious Grace is Lust, rich girl Katie is Greed and so on. When “Pride”, AKA Aubrey (Brenna Llewellyn), is perceived to have transgressed their code – by recording her innermost thoughts in a leather-bound journal (very Mean Girls) – Grace and her acolytes commence a ruthless bullying campaign that culminates in Aubrey’s disappearance on the edge of the woods. The town’s well-meaning but bumbling sheriff, Fred Middleton (Aleks Paunovic), investigates (a nod to Scream’s Deputy Dewey), as a remorseful Grace scrambles to destroy any evidence of her involvement. Then the rest of the Sins start turning up dead, their corpses prettily accessorised with a single rose pressed between their lips. That would be enough to keep most girls quiet, but not Aubrey, whose verbose beyond-the-grave narration commits many sins against cinema’s first commandment of “show, don’t tell”. There is also one of those dastardly villains who, once unmasked, can’t resist putting off an escape to lay out their entire warped plan in detail. Even with such lengthy explanation, the characters’ motivations and plot twist doesn’t make much sense. At least The Sinners’ sexy-schoolgirl-corpse aesthetic – part Twin Peaks, part Ariana Grande music video – is too ineptly executed to truly offend. • Available from 22 February on digital platforms.	374
Lee Daniels’ bland, stilted, TV-movie treatment of the final years in the life of jazz singing legend Billie Holiday, imprisoned on a drugs charge and officially harassed long after her release, is fatally compromised by its own misjudged and obtuse romantic fantasy. The film rhapsodises that, after a lifetime of abuse from men, and a persistent campaign of victimisation from federal agents enraged by her courageous anti-lynching song Strange Fruit, Holiday’s emotional life was redeemed by a gallant, secret love affair with an undercover federal agent called Jimmy Fletcher; that is, someone working for the very people who had been making her life a misery. Holiday is played by singer Andra Day and Fletcher by Trevante Rhodes; Garrett Hedlund plays Harry Anslinger, the tight-lipped racist chief of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics. Fletcher was one of the African American agents employed by Anslinger after the second world war to infiltrate jazz clubs to root out drug use – and to make drugs the pretext for clamping down on black political culture. Until recently, Fletcher had been considered a real-life but minor figure in Holiday’s life: he hung around the fringes of the jazz scene, befriended Holiday and finally to her fury actually arrested her. He later told Holiday’s would-be biographer, Linda Kuehl, in a taped interview in the 1970s that he always regretted the betrayal, that she had forgiven him and affectionately inscribed a copy of her autobiography for him. After Kuehl’s death in 1978, itself an odd footnote to Holiday’s life recently investigated by documentary-maker James Erskine, various biographers made use of her audiotapes without paying much attention to Fletcher. But in 2015, British journalist Johann Hari published a book about drug legislation called Chasing the Scream, with a section about the drug war on Billie Holiday that that this movie is based on. In it, Hari boldly declares his intuition that Fletcher had “fallen in love” with Holiday. Maybe he had. And maybe she fell in love with him. But there is something tonally very odd about elevating this imagined love affair to an accepted part of her life, with sensitive G-man dreamboat Fletcher supportively hanging around, following her on tour, and finally entrancing Billie with his gentle and considerate love-making with Billie not minding that he is still working for the Feds. That is especially so when, in real life, Billie Holiday’s magnificent courage and defiance took place in spite of men and their reactionary bullying. The film only really comes to life when Day sings Holiday’s songs, such as Ain’t Nobody’s Business If I Do, with its poignant and shocking lyrics about abuse: “I’d rather my man would hit me / Than jump right up and quit me.” It’s conceivable that the film is suggesting that the tragic dysfunction of accepting domestic violence as the price for love is comparable to Fletcher’s own presumed crisis of loyalty and self-respect. But in the film, Fletcher doesn’t seem to be troubled by that much of a crisis. Even when he takes heroin with Holiday to show a kind of solidarity, the ensuing traumatised flashback is in Holiday’s mind, not his, back to her own brutal upbringing of violence and rape. Then there is the main event itself: the remarkable Strange Fruit, a radical, confrontational protest song that was for decades the only public acknowledgment in mainstream American culture that lynching existed at all. Understandably, screenwriter Suzan-Lori Parks waits until the third act before it is performed in full. Day’s rendition is heartfelt. But the direction and storytelling are laborious, without the panache and incorrectness of earlier Daniels movies such as Precious (2008) and The Paperboy (2012). A cloud of solemnity and reverence hangs over it, briefly dispelled by the music itself. • Released on 27 February on Sky Cinema.	733
It’s a popular lament in the comment section of this column that Hollywood remakes are to be viewed with scorn and derision. But film-makers surely have a right to try to deliver a truly definitive big-screen version of a famous myth, even if dozens before them have failed miserably. If so, this bodes well for Zack Snyder, who reports this week suggest hopes to be the latest director to pull Excalibur from the stone and restore King Arthur to the multiplexes. Snyder is at his best when adapting bounteous source material and at his knuckle-headed worst when he is starting from scratch. Hence, his Watchmen is a lovingly vivid, gorgeously rendered adaptation of the classic Alan Moore graphic novel, while his Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is generally terrible, bar the rare moments when Snyder is cribbing directly from the comics. So what legend is richer in classic fantasy mythology than the tale of the once and future king? There have been scores of film and television series based on different elements of the story, from Arthur’s rise from serf to royalty, to his founding of the knights of the round table, the quest for the holy grail, Arthur’s cuckolding by Lancelot, and countless more. And yet Snyder would be wise to cast his eyes over the rotting corpses of those who went before him, for getting Camelot right is clearly harder than it might at first seem. Guy Ritchie’s recent King Arthur: Legend of the Sword was originally intended to be the first of six movies starring Charlie Hunnam as the mythical British king, but ended up losing Warner Bros $150m and drawing such scathing reviews that the prospect of part deux sank faster than the lady of the lake. It’s not actually such a bad movie, provided you buy into the idea that Ritchie’s fondness for cockney bruisers, blitzkrieg-quick edits and tabloid-inspired stunt casting – David Beckham as a scar-faced henchman, anyone? – works perfectly for such fantasy material. Unfortunately, even those of us who found the movie an entertaining enough romp probably recognise that another film-maker would have been better suited to the task, though at least Ritchie got rid of the Christian piety of some previous versions. Drifting a little further back in time, and we have 2004’s King Arthur, a movie that recast our hero as a Romano-Celtic defender against invading Saxons. It was promoted as a tale that cleaved closely to the facts behind Arthurian legend, yet ultimately managed to cut out all the magic without bringing the story any closer to actual historical events – a neat trick indeed. Antoine Fuqua’s film is perhaps now best remembered for a row over Keira Knightley’s chest, which was photoshopped for an American poster, much to the actor’s disgust. Arthouse fans might point to 1981’s lurid and doom-laden Excalibur, which certainly takes the subject matter seriously and features a stand-out performance from the young Helen Mirren as gorgeous, mad-eyed temptress Morgana. And yet John Boorman’s film is by turns over- and under-cooked, one moment utterly lacking in sparkle, the next ruined by hammy, careless overacting. Nigel Terry, as Arthur, never quite nails the part. Disney’s The Sword in the Stone, based on the TH White novel, is whimsical fun, but hardly momentous. First Knight, from 1994, is so woefully miscast that it’s hard to take seriously. Perhaps the problem here is that we all know the story of Arthur so well that film-makers fall over themselves trying to bring something fresh to the tale. And yet, perhaps what we really need is a simple, classical retelling that delves deeply into the myth without trying to update it for modern audiences, or tell us “the real story we thought we knew”. White’s Once And Future King quadrilogy ought to be part of the picture, along with its 15th-century source material Le Morte d’Arthur by Sir Thomas Malory, and other Arthurian literature such as Geoffrey of Monmouth’s 12th-century Historia Regum Britanniae. Unfortunately, there remains the nagging suspicion that the tragic nature of Arthur’s ultimate fall from grace make this a troublesome quest for modern Hollywood to successfully take on. Any movie that aims to tell the full legend is eventually going to have to deal with what is as an extremely downbeat ending. Whoever does get the next bite at the apple, let us also hope that they veer as far as possible from real historical events and peoples as possible. Give us spells, mythical beasts and heroism, rather than Vikings, Picts and Roman withdrawal. Fascinating as that history remains, the story of Arthur and Merlin would never have lasted down the centuries had it been a tale of ancient British warriors trying in vain to stem the Anglo-Saxon tide. It was all the far-out, bizarre and fabulous elements thrown into the cauldron by myriad minds that ultimately made for such a potent fantasy potion.	936
The much-praised London-set teen drama Rocks has emerged as the lead winner of the British independent film awards (Bifas), which were announced on Thursday in a virtual ceremony hosted by actor Tom Felton. Rocks, directed by Sarah Gavron and produced by Faye Ward and Ameenah Ayub Allen, stars Bukky Bakray as a girl left to look after her brother when her mother abandons them; it won five awards including best British independent film, best supporting actress for Kosar Ali, best supporting actor for D’Angelou Osei Kissiedu and best casting. Ali also won the award for most promising newcomer. Bakray, however, was surprisingly beaten in the race for the best actress award by Wunmi Mosaku, who co-starred in the Netflix refugee horror His House, which won four Bifas. Remi Weekes, the film’s writer-director, took home the best director award, and the film also won best effects and best production design. Next in number of awards with three was The Father, a study of dementia starring Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins won best actor, and the film won best screenplay and best editing. The night was a personal triumph for Riz Ahmed, who – despite losing out as best actor for rap drama Mogul Mowgli – took home the debut screenwriter award for the same film (for which he was jointly credited with the film’s director, Bassam Tariq) as well as the best British short film award for The Long Goodbye which he co-created to accompany his acclaimed album of the same name.

To quote Gene Wilder’s Willy Wonka, the news that a third Paddington film is in the works shines like a good deed in a weary world. Hailed as one of the best family movies of modern times, Paddington 2 has amassed cult fanbase, and it’s easy to see why. From the earnest aphorisms of Paddington himself to the glory of Hugh Grant’s narcissistic, preening Phoenix Buchanan, the film is marmalade-packed with wit and warmth. Grant even suggested, in his customarily dry way, that it was perhaps the best film he had ever been in. But in the shadow of such a success, is a third film a mistake, especially if it is to be completed without Paul King in the director’s chair? Reports suggest that many of the first two films’ other key creatives will be involved. Yet few threequels hit the same emotional resonance as, say, Toy Story 3, or conclude an epic saga like Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. Indeed, Hollywood history shows us that the construction of a threequel is precarious, and often ends in anticlimax. The balance between grounding the film in what came before and offering novel emotional or narrative tension is the major challenge when revisiting the same characters (as exemplified by every Star Wars film). In the animated world, Shrek the Third was by no means a complete washout but by the time we get to the end of the story, the eponymous ogre has “learned” the same emotional lessons three films in a row. Without the liveliness of its predecessors – or of Jennifer Saunders covering Bonnie Tyler – it struggled to make the same impact. If a threequel cannot offer character growth, it often seeks to raise the stakes, and can thus fall victim to its own excesses. X-Men: The Last Stand, Spider-Man 3 and Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End all threw everything bar the kitchen sink at their nominal finales, introducing broader canvases, bigger action scenes and heftier CGI budgets to little avail. The Matrix Revolutions’ reliance on spectacle dulled the electricity of the original, and The Dark Knight Rises took a step away from the more grounded tone that characterised Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. The caveat is that an expanding scale can work, while character growth across three films isn’t always a necessity. The characters in the Lord of the Rings hardly change across the trilogy. While Michael Bond’s books serve as the inspiration for the Paddington films, there is no grand meta-narrative to bring the trilogy together. The third instalment will have to rely on the same neat writing that underpinned the first two films, and succeed on its own terms. Naturally, Paddington 3 will not be dealing with apocalyptic stakes and, if in need of inspiration, could learn from the successes of the Bridget Jones and To All the Boys trilogies. Both were able to bring sweetness without being saccharine, and gave their series a satisfying emotional and narrative arc when viewed as a whole. While Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, for instance, was able to succeed by amplifying what audiences liked about Raiders of the Lost Ark and subtracting what they didn’t in Temple of Doom, no amount of vocal gymnastics could save Pitch Perfect 3 from feeling a hollow retread of its quirky, refreshing original. By injecting a new emotional arc through the introduction of Henry Jones Snr, Steven Spielberg’s threequel was able to make the most of the groundwork that had been laid before, while revealing more about a character we had grown to love. In reality (and despite the fact that fourth instalment appeared in 2019), the Toy Story trilogy will be the gold standard that Paddington aims for. The Pixar films succeed by working as three perfectly balanced, standalone stories that slot together and become more than the sum of their parts. It may sound daunting, but a return to Paddington’s picture-postcard London, coloured in Wes Anderson-esque pastels, could be just what we all need. There’s so much fertile land still to cover. Did Aunt Lucy enjoy her stay? Is Knuckles’ tea room still thriving or did he fall back into a life of crime? Will Phoenix invigorate a post-Covid West End with his one-man show? Fine … we’ll take a quadrilogy instead.	827
A Trip to the Moon (1902) Plucky French scientists travel to the moon and back, meeting its strange, hostile inhabitants. This is an important film, stretching a narrative over 14 minutes, rather than the then-standard two. But it’s also a lot of fun, and contains perhaps the most famous image in all silent cinema, as the man in the moon gets a rocket in the eye. The Peasants’ Lot (1912) In pre-revolutionary Russia, a destitute peasant girl is pushed into the hands of a manipulative “city man”. The Peasants’ Lot is about modernity – the pull of the city and the acceleration, and accelerating immorality, of life there. But it’s also about the world before the modern, the rustic old Russia about to be left behind. The Great Train Robbery (1903) Another classic film and another classic shot, this time featuring a cowboy unloading his revolver into the camera while looking down the lens at us, the audience. The shot could be played either at the beginning or the end of the film, with no effect on the story – the point is the giddy, guilty thrill. Newcastle United v Liverpool (1901) Very early cinema was half documentary, half blockbuster, with film screenings mixing recordings of newsworthy events and escapist narratives. Newcastle United v Liverpool, a grainy capturing of a classic fixture, has a bit of both. It offers up the then-revolutionary thrill of pictures in motion: players clattering and hoofing the ball. The Sinking of the Lusitania (1918) The sinking of the RMS Lusitania is recreated in black-and-white animation. Director Winsor McCay had previously dealt with dinosaurs and dragons; here rendered 3D-style naval movements are counter-balanced with flat, silhouetted compositions; thriller and tragedy competing. A Trip Down Market Street (1906) One long tracking shot, showing San Francisco just four days before it was largely demolished by an earthquake. It’s staged but, still, this is a remarkably immersive stroll through a world otherwise lost to the past. Welcome to Edwardian California: all top hats and moustaches, and trams rumbling over dusty, cobbled streets. Les Vampires (1915-16) A police chief has been beheaded by the very gang he was investigating: the mysterious, cat-suited “Vampires”. Thus begins seven hours of creepy French mystery, hunting gangs across labyrinthine mid-war Paris. The film’s power is in its capacity to tell a narrative story – reel after reel of it – visually. Alfred Hitchcock and Fritz Lang were taking notes. Intolerance (1916) The Birth of a Nation the year before was arguably more cinematically inventive, but try sitting through all its appalling racism. This was meant to be director DW Griffith’s response to criticism of that film; it attempted to cram four stories of disastrous “intolerance” into three and a half hours, hurtling from ancient Babylon to the present day, by way of inventive zoom-ins, pull-backs and closeups. The Outlaw and His Wife (1918) A 19th-century love story with a social conscience, as a desperate bread thief in Iceland runs away to the wild. The natural imagery, full of monochrome monoliths foreshadowing the photography of Ansel Adams, is extraordinary. Director Victor Sjöström was about to become a Swedish icon, and an influence on Bergman. J’Accuse (1919) Two men in love with the same woman end up serving together in the first world war. It sounds like a screwball comedy, but it’s really, really not. At the western front, French director Abel Glance recreates the horror of war with technically dazzling effectiveness. Approaching the 1920s, film was only just getting started.	700
This documentary about the hugely prolific Frank Zappa, directed by Alex “Bill Preston Esq” Winter, takes an unusually serious-minded approach to the celebrated wild man of 1960s and 70s American rock: ranging from his unusual childhood, to his ferocious work ethic, to his political-sphere interventions, this is a fruitful attempt to get under the skin of a figure who is renowned for lurking eccentrically at the music industry’s periphery. One thing it doesn’t focus much on is the music itself; perhaps the ongoing devotion of Zappa’s hardcore fans means there’s no compelling reason to introduce the work to a new generation. In Winter’s eyes, Zappa’s oddness was set early: the son of a chemical engineer who worked for an army poison gas lab, his musical interests were sparked by an album of experimental percussion by modernist composer Edgar Varèse (the exact quote: “the most frightening, evil, vile thing a human being could listen to; I couldn’t understand why people didn’t love it”); an early encounter with the law, which saw him ejected from the small-town studio he set up as a young man for supposedly agreeing to help make a “stag film”, set him on the way to embracing the counterculture in Los Angeles and later New York. The film is at pains to counter some of the more enduring Zappa myths: he was not some whacked-out hippy, avoided drugs, and worked with a focused dedication to realise his musical vision. The cost of this is spelled out: many of the musicians found him a distant presence, ready to ditch them once their purpose was served; his children had to pitch for his attention; and his wife Gail, who speaks here at length before her death in 2015, had to contend with Zappa’s well-known fondness for the groupie lifestyle and – to put it mildly – some unreconstructed views on women. Winter also devotes lengthy sequences to Zappa’s congressional testimony in opposition to labelling record lyrics, and his unlikely adoption as a cultural envoy by post-cold war Czechoslovakia. There’s perhaps a little too much telling us what a genius Zappa was without really letting us hear for ourselves; this perhaps also explains the stress laid on his “classical” compositions, as if to reinforce his serious-musician credentials. But there’s no denying Zappa’s personal charisma and devotion to his cause, nor his articulacy in its service. Winter has created a fascinating watch. • Available at Altitude.Film.	480
There’s a diseased yellow cast to the photography here, a sawing anxiety in the score, which means that even a moment of joyous summer release – a water fight among children – is undermined by a lurking sense of unease. Bad Tales, the second feature film from Damiano and Fabio D’Innocenzo, is a slippery thing, an urban fairytale unfolding under cautionary storm clouds in a sweltering suburb of Rome. Three families, not friends exactly but neighbours in a state of churlish co-existence, are the focus of a story narrated by an unknown male. He claims that the tale comes from a girl’s diary, but seeds the possibility of untruths. There’s a trickle-down of toxicity in this disappointed backwater, which has as its source the men of the families. The children pick up on the resentment, the swaggering sexuality that bears a taint of aggrieved anger. What chance do these kids have? A pregnant teenager wears her parental unfitness with a mocking smirk; middle-school students Dennis and Alessia cling together as their father vents his unpredictable anger. And spindly Geremia struggles to talk to beautiful Viola, whose father discusses her academic mediocrity as if she weren’t present. Parental indifference is not attuned to the looming tragedy in this horribly compelling fable. Bad Tales is on Mubi	247
Bill and Ted actor turned director Alex Winter brings a fan’s eye and a shared maverick sensibility to this suitably unruly documentary about rock musician and composer Frank Zappa. His music, it’s fair to say, is not for everyone, but the film succeeds in conveying the exhilarating connection felt by those who get it. Long-term Zappa collaborator Ruth Underwood plays the piano part of The Black Page, a piece described as being “the forefront of innovation in regard to rhythmic polymetric notation”. Her delighted smile when she nails it perfectly matches a photo of the same moment, on stage several decades previously, with Zappa beaming approval back at her. Winter had a lot to work with: Zappa kept an exhaustive archive of recordings and material, documenting every aspect of his wide-ranging career and frequently recalcitrant public persona. Key to the success of the film is the editing, a pinballing assault of free association, claymation and gleeful profanity, which goes some way towards recreating what it must have been like to spend time inside Zappa’s head. Zappa is available on Altitude.film	205
“Caring, sir, is my job, my profession,” says Rosamund Pike’s dead-eyed protagonist in this efficiently callous, if rather uneven, black-comedy thriller. “All I do every day is care…” Exactly what Marla Grayson cares about is clear: money, and the power to do “whatever the fuck we want” that goes with it. To this end, she has developed a profitable scam that preys upon older people – hijacking their lives and fortunes by becoming their legal state guardian, and then milking their assets for all they’re worth. As a slimy-suited shark lawyer observes: “If your whole enterprise isn’t the perfect embodiment of the American dream, I don’t know what is.” But when Marla picks the wrong “cherry”, she finds herself face-to-face with Roman (Peter Dinklage), a former Russian mafia drug trafficker with a penchant for cakes, smoothies and cutting off his enemies’ fingers. Written and directed by J Blakeson, who made the viscerally twisty three-hander The Disappearance of Alice Creed, I Care a Lot is a gleefully vicious affair, carried by Pike, who wears a smile that could strip wallpaper at 40 paces, and whose vape smoke evokes a dragon preparing to burn the world down. After an early courtroom confrontation with an exasperated Macon Blair, who claims that Marla has effectively kidnapped his mother, she tells him she will “grab your dick and balls and rip them clean off”. From here, we watch Marla and her partner and lover, Fran (Eiza González), target their next victim, Jennifer Peterson (Dianne Wiest), a woman of wealth with no family, living quietly on her own. Despite insisting that she doesn’t need help, Jennifer is court-ordered out of her house and into the imprisoning corridors of the Berkshire Oaks retirement home – a bravura sequence executed with a Kafka-esque efficiency that reminded me of Steven Soderbergh’s nightmarish Unsane. Yet for all her apparent vulnerability (Wiest is terrific at portraying the gut-wrenching mix of bewilderment and helplessness her character experiences), Jennifer is not quite what she appears. In fact, she is “the worst mistake you’ll ever make” – a woman with hidden assets whose disappearance from her home sets alarm bells ringing with people who can make Marla’s life “very uncomfortable”. One rebuffed visit from Chris Messina’s stash-carrying lawyer later, Marla is tied to a chair, staring death in the face. Painted in bubblegum hues (the cherry red of Marla’s dress; the deep blue of Jennifer’s stolen house; the garish purple-pink of Roman’s fondant fancies) and shot in oversaturated tones that reflect the artifice and plastic superficiality of this world, Blakeson’s film has a slick, vacuum-sealed visual sheen, matched by a brittle synth-pop soundtrack. As with The Disappearance of Alice Creed, the genuinely disturbing elements of the opening act – Jennifer’s incarceration; the vulnerability of the elderly – gradually give way to more generic, heisty thrills, with Blakeson revelling in wrongfooting the audience and upending our sympathies and allegiances in a manner that recalls the Wachowskis’ debut feature Bound. Dinklage is particularly good as the sotto voce criminal who hates getting angry, and who sucks a straw like a vampire sucking blood – a quality mirrored by his new nemesis. Yet this is very much Pike’s show; she lends a touch of Nic Cage-like craziness to her portrayal of this too-far-gone girl. In a morally bankrupt world of horrible people doing horrible things, Marla and Roman are flipsides of the same coin: two poisonous snakes intertwined in a nest of vipers. The result is a nicely nasty tragicomedy, a rollercoaster ride that swaps real moral dilemmas for something more disposably entertaining, picking you up, spinning you around and then spitting you out with a neat sucker-punch ending that leaves you feeling entertained, if a little bit empty.

I Walk on Water is a hefty documentary project from artist and film-maker Khalik Allah: something that might be called an investigative meditation on the lives of the homeless, the marginal and the dispossessed in Harlem in New York City, and the film-maker’s own life. Lasting three hours and 19 minutes, it is an expansive collage of video, celluloid and 16mm, in colour and black-and-white, something close to underground cinema. Allah simply lets the camera roll open-endedly and talks to street people like the Haitian man nicknamed Frenchie (we never hear what his actual name is), whom he has photographed before. The director often uses the 125th Street subway station as his base of operations; he features rappers’ performances and also films the uniformed NYPD cops, whose faces are half-smiling masks of opaque indulgence. Allah brings his Italian girlfriend, Camila, into the story, recording his often agonised introspective conversations with her. (He reveals at one stage that apparently his film was going to be called “Camila”). He moreover bizarrely includes encounters with his own longsuffering parents: conversations during which he candidly reveals himself to be under the influence of shrooms and believes himself to be Jesus Christ – to his mother’s very considerable dismay. This sequence explains the title, and, also, on a slightly more serious level, could have something to do with his concerns for the lowly, the last whom Jesus said would be first. This is a film which has been described as “immersive”, though a sceptic might say that its sheer length means that audiences, however sympathetic, will inevitably at moments lose attention and de-immerse. Maybe some of it is redundant, and there are an awful lot of droning druggie conversations off-camera, including a very weird discussion about how awful brussels sprouts are. But the length is what gives it its texture, and its shapelessness is how it becomes exploratory, almost a real-time autobiography. Allah is asking profound questions, in his way, about what it is like to be people like Frenchie, to live outside the framework of connected prosperity. • Released on 26 February on digital platforms.	406
The Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), the body that organises and votes on the Golden Globe awards, has been accused of “ethical lapses” and of failing to maintain a sufficiently diverse membership. An investigation by the LA Times claims that the nonprofit body paid members large sums, nearly $2m in total, for tasks such as serving on committees and watching films and that many of its members have only tenuous careers as journalists. Responding to the LA Times, the HFPA said: “Our compensation decisions are based on an evaluation of compensation practices by similar nonprofit organisations and market rates for such services.” An HFPA representative said the suggestion that many of their members are not serious journalists is “outdated and unfair”, and that the organisation has “a robust admissions and reaccreditation process” and that its members “write for some of the most reputable publications in the world.” The HFPA is infamously erratic in its award-making process, with claims that voters are happy to accept “hospitality” in the form of gifts and in-person events with industry stars. The 2021 edition of the Golden Globes has sparked controversy by excluding Michaela Coel’s acclaimed series I May Destroy You, as well as including Sia’s controversial feature film Music, which has been accused of misrepresenting autistic people. A recent anti-trust suit against the HFPA, brought by Norwegian journalist Kjersti Flaa who was refused membership, was dismissed. According to the LA Times, while the 87-strong HFPA’s ranks include a number of people of colour, there are no black members. A representative of the group says the HFPA is aware of the issue and is “committed to addressing” it. The representative also said that the perception that many members are not serious journalists is “outdated and unfair”, adding that the organisation has “a robust admissions and reaccreditation process” and that its members “write for some of the most reputable publications in the world.” While the HFPA’s ranks include a number of people of colour, there are no Black members, a fact a representative says the group is aware of and is “committed to addressing.” The HFPA’s principal revenue is derived from the televised Golden Globes awards show, which in 2020 saw it receive over $27m from NBC. Since its inception in 1944, the Globes have been courted by Hollywood publicists keen to improve their films’ chances at the Oscars. Past scandals include the selection of Pia Zadora as new star of the year in 1982 after a lavish campaign funded by her then husband, casino owner Meshulam Riklis, and the gift of scores of expensive watches to support the nomination of Sharon Stone for The Muse in 1999. The Golden Globe awards will take place on 28 February.	521
Barry Sonnenfeld, director My wife and I were about to take our first cruise and I needed a book. I hadn’t read any Elmore Leonard novels but Get Shorty was about Hollywood so I thought it’d be interesting. I bought it and loved it. A few years previously I had shot Throw Momma from the Train with Danny DeVito and I called him and he said: “I’ll buy it, you direct it and I’ll produce and star in it.” I saw Danny as Chili Palmer because, for me, the strength of Chili and the strength of Danny is self-confidence. It took for ever to get made. We were turned down by every studio, including Danny’s. No one wanted to do an Elmore Leonard book because previously they had all failed at the box office, and no one wanted to do an “inside Hollywood” movie either. Elmore had nothing to do with the screenplay. He never even asked to read it. He came to set for just one day, only because I invited him, and couldn’t believe there was a chair that said “Elmore Leonard”. It didn’t work out with Danny playing Chili. Thank God he played the role he was born to play, which was Shorty. John Travolta [who played Chili Palmer] turned the movie down twice until Quentin Tarantino intervened. Tarantino had dated one of Get Shorty’s producers, who gave him the script. He called John and said: “This is not the movie you pass on.” Travolta said he didn’t get it, but Quentin said: “Trust me and do it.” John was perfect as Chili Palmer. He is one of the greatest actors with a walk. Whether it’s Saturday Night Fever or Pulp Fiction, his walk exudes confidence. Gene Hackman [as Harry Zimm] never tried to be funny. He was scary as hell to work with – he’s very intimidating and suffers no fools. After the New York premiere he pulled me aside and said: “I wanted you to know, the entire time I was working with you I didn’t think you had a fucking clue what you were doing.” I said: “OK, thanks Gene.” He said: “That’s not my point.” I said: “Oh there’s more?” He said: “I’m so mad at myself because if I had realised you knew what you were doing, I could’ve done so much better!” Danny DeVito, actor I directed Throw Momma from the Train and Barry Sonnenfeld was my cinematographer. We got along really well. Afterwards I started my production company, and said to him: “Let’s look for something for you to direct.” Barry called one day and said: “I’m at an airport and I bought an Elmore Leonard book called Get Shorty. I’ve just started it but I love it and think it’s the one.” I had so much faith in him that right away I got a guy on the phone, made a deal and got an option on the book. I had somebody go out and get a copy of it so I could take a look because I hadn’t read it. Barry wanted me to play Chili Palmer but I said no. I liked Martin Weir [“Shorty”]. With Martin, I tried to be full of myself. It’s the closest I’ve ever come to playing myself in a movie – I also have pictures of myself all over my house. No, that’s not true, I’m kidding. I didn’t base Martin on anybody, it was just what it was in the script, which was really well written by Scott Frank. It was good fun. Barry wanted Gene Hackman to play Harry Zimm. It just so happened that his agent was my agent so I called him up. But there was a night scene in the movie and he said he didn’t work at night. I said: “It’s only one scene. We’ll do it real quick and get you out by midnight.” He said “No, I don’t work at night.” It was a dealbreaker. Barry insisted it had to be a night scene, and I eventually convinced Gene to do it but he said: “You only get one night.” During that night shoot I was hanging out with Hackman a lot because I didn’t want him to get squirrelly and leave. I think we went over midnight but he was a good guy and stuck it out. Several weeks later, I went to the editing room with Barry. I said: “Where’s the night scene?” He says: “Oh, it didn’t work so I cut it out.” I said: “You motherfucker …”	952
Do not adjust your set. The long pauses of black screen during this studiedly serious anthology of experimental shorts made by cinematographers during the pandemic lockdown are deliberate. It’s been put together by the American-Egyptian director Sam Abbas, who invited five cinematographers to take part in his lockdown challenge, shooting a film on their phones. The result feels a bit like being fed a plate of arthouse vegetables, a collection of not always easy-to-watch films, randomly connected and with a total running time of 58 minutes that, to be honest, is a bit of a slog. The opening film is a purely experimental piece by Soledad Rodríguez, her camera prowling hungrily for images. She uses a filter or effect that makes even ordinary images look unsettlingly like a sci-fi or horror movie: in a wood, two dogs stand to attention and look like hounds of hell about to attack at any moment. Antoine Héberlé’s contribution, a self-conscious film with a new-wave feel about a woman sitting in her apartment listlessly staring out of her window, didn’t really work for me. Abbas has described the collection as being “about everything and nothing”. The film most obviously about something is directed by Alexis Zabé, the cinematographer behind the stunning images in Carlos Reygadas’s Post Tenebras Lux. Here he shoots an arresting mini-doc about a tent community of homeless people living in Venice Beach, Los Angeles. At the end, the camera lingers on a message attached to wire fencing: “Love. Be kind”. At first the letters seemed to me to be written in gold helium balloons. Actually, it’s yellow cordon tape – a hopeful message stamped all over with the words “caution”. I would happily watch 58 minutes of Zabé’s film, but in the main, these films would possibly work better on the walls of a gallery. • Released on 26 February on digital platforms.	364
Woody Allen has rebutted renewed allegations, in the HBO documentary Allen v Farrow, that he sexually assaulted his daughter Dylan in 1992, calling the series “a hatchet job riddled with falsehoods”. In a statement to the Hollywood Reporter, Allen and his wife, Soon-Yi Previn, said that film-makers Amy Ziering and Kirby Dick had “spent years surreptitiously collaborating with the Farrows and their enablers to put together a hatchet job riddled with falsehoods”. They added: “As has been known for decades, these allegations are categorically false. Multiple agencies investigated them at the time and found that, whatever Dylan Farrow may have been led to believe, absolutely no abuse had ever taken place.” In a TV interview in 2018, Dylan Farrow denied she had been “brainwashed” or “coached” into making allegations against Allen. Allen v Farrow, which aired its first of four episodes on Sunday on HBO in the US, is described by Ziering and Dick as an investigation into the allegations, which emerged during the custody battle after Allen’s separation from Mia Farrow in 1992. Ziering also denied their film was “a collaboration … with [Dylan Farrow] or the family”. There has been no response so far from the Farrows regarding the claims made by Allen and Previn about the documentary. Allen has consistently denied any allegations of sexual abuse against Dylan Farrow, which were investigated in 1992-93 by Connecticut state police, the Child Sexual Abuse Clinic of Yale New Haven Hospital, and the New York Department of Social Services; none concluded that sexual assault had taken place. Mia Farrow and her son Ronan appear in Allen v Farrow, while Allen and Previn declined to participate. The statement says Allen and Previn “were approached less than two months ago and given only a matter of days ‘to respond’. Of course, they declined to do so.” Dylan’s brother Moses, who has defended Allen from the allegations, also reportedly declined to appear in the film. The Guardian spoke to the documentary’s lead investigator Amy Herdy who claims to have reached out to Allen’s team back in June 2018 but “got crickets back”. She added: “I know that they got my requests because I had an assistant on the phone” who said they were getting her emails. Ziering and Dick have previously worked together on a string of hard-hitting documentaries about sexual abuse, including the Oscar-nominated The Invisible War, which focused on rape in the US military and The Hunting Ground, about sex assaults on university campuses.	483
Director Yasmin Fedda, who is from a Palestinian and Syrian background and lectures in film at Queen Mary University of London, has created a powerful and urgent documentary tribute to those who have been “forcibly disappeared” by the Assad regime in Syria, estimated to be around 150,000 since 2011. Fedda focuses on two people: dissident writer and computer programmer Bassel Khartabil, who was abducted in October 2015 in Damascus, and Father Paolo Dall’Oglio, the hugely popular and admired Christian priest who was taken in July 2013 in Raqqa. She uses existing video of these two, from various family members and organisations, along with her own footage showing the campaigns of the loved ones left behind with their burden of anguish and their need to battle on and bring these crimes to the world’s attention. In particular, we talk to Bassel’s wife, Noura Ghazi, and Paolo’s sister Immacolata, or Machi. Their testimony is deeply moving: they are courageous, stoic, determined. It is heartbreaking to see Noura, so young and joyous in Bassel’s company, then careworn and marooned in a spiritual void of uncertainty about whether Bassel is alive or dead. It is wrenching also when Machi tells us of the choice she has to make: to stop thinking about her brother or to endure the pain of continuing to campaign, to post online, to keep the search alive, but with it the danger of unthinkably raw grief. As she poignantly puts it: “I prefer to take the risk of hoping.” The forcibly disappeared of Syria emerge from this film as comparable to los desaparecidos of Argentina in the dark days of the junta – a tyranny that was brought low at least partly due to the women who bore public witness to those taken. Released on 26 February on True Story.	346
New drama Judas and the Black Messiah harkens back to the late 60s, when the FBI labelled the Black Panthers as “the greatest threat to internal security of the country”. It sought to neutralise them by any means available: infiltration, surveillance and, ultimately, the assassination of Fred Hampton, the “black messiah” of the title, forcefully played by Daniel Kaluuya. In J Edgar Hoover’s mind, the FBI was protecting “our way of life”; to many in the African-American community and beyond, the FBI was the threat. For decades, Hollywood has presented the FBI as the best of American policing, upholder – as per its motto – of “fidelity, bravery and integrity”, and it’s not hard to figure out why. Hoover was the master of controlling the message. There was James Cagney’s 1935 hit G-Men, for example, a pro-government riposte to those dangerous gangster movies. Or 1959’s The FBI Story, a “greatest hits” of the bureau’s achievements. Hoover, who was friends with the director Mervyn LeRoy, personally ordered reshoots of scenes he didn’t like, and pushed to cast James Stewart as the archetypal G-Man: athletic, straight, white, male. It helped that the bureau kept files on stars such as Charlie Chaplin, Marilyn Monroe and Orson Welles. Who knows what leverage it had? When Hoover got wind of 1967 farce The President’s Analyst, which belittled him and the FBI, he reportedly “went ballistic”. The film disappeared from theatres. And look what happened to Jean Seberg. After she supported the Panthers, the FBI bugged and intimidated the actor, even spreading false rumours about her pregnancy. She killed herself in 1979. Even after the Hoover regime, Hollywood went on serving up heroic FBI agents, from The Silence of the Lambs’ Clarice Starling to Netflix’s Mindhunter. Clint Eastwood and Leo DiCaprio’s biopic J Edgar seemed more interested in Hoover’s repressed sexuality than his racism, while in Alan Parker’s Mississippi Burning the FBI was even painted as the white saviour of the civil rights movement, taking on the Ku Klux Klan. Now we are starting to see alternative perspectives. A primer for Judas and the Black Messiah would be the recent doc MLK/FBI, which details the lengths the bureau went through to sabotage Martin Luther King’s movement. Kristen Stewart’s recent biopic didn’t exactly do Seberg justice, but was at least a sign that the industry could finally take on the bureau. In a similar vein, Lee Daniels’s The United States vs Billie Holiday details the singer’s persecution by the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, the FBI’s partners in crime prevention. Of course, the FBI has done good, too (it really did take on the Klan), but it can hardly complain about being the subject of further investigation.	560
It’s not surprising that S1m0ne wasn’t a hit at the time of its release in 2002. The premise is preposterous. Its dialogue is often absurd. The tone oscillates wildly from proclamations about the human condition to slapstick sequences. What is perplexing, however, is that in the intervening years it has not been reappraised as a cult classic for those same reasons. If there were any justice, cinemas post-pandemic would be filled with crowds in fancy dress shouting along to every ridiculous one-liner (“I love you … LA”, “I know that tree”), critics penning serious-minded articles about its prescient world-building. Instead, it’s one of those films whose stellar cast – Al Pacino, Winona Ryder, Catherine Keener, Evan Rachel Wood, Jason Schwartzman – do their best to pretend they never appeared in it. The New York Times called it “post-entertainment – it’s tepid and vapid”. The career of writer-producer-director Andrew Niccol, fresh from the success of Gattaca and The Truman Show (for which he won a screenwriting Bafta and an Academy award nomination), never quite recovered. Pacino plays Viktor Taransky, a misunderstood director whose latest film is derailed when its high-strung female lead (Ryder) suddenly quits. He is harangued by Keener, already typecast as “exasperated ex-wife”, to compromise his artistic vision in the name of “business”. But after an encounter with a shadowy individual he comes into possession of some cutting-edge floppy disks, which contain an experimental computer program that allows him to create an artificial actor. The result is Simulation One, or S1m0ne, the perfect Hollywood star: she works tirelessly for free, is fine with nudity, does her own stunts and will never go off the rails. This being the early noughties, she is naturally a thin, blonde, white woman, portrayed by 24-year-old Victoria’s Secret model Rachel Roberts (who Niccol married later that year). The film is a hit, making S1m0ne an overnight sensation: “A star is digitised,” Taransky quips. It is, ostensibly, about the rise of artificial intelligence: Taransky is modelled on Victor Frankenstein as well as the divisive inventor and transhumanist Ray Kurzweil. While the film’s predictions were seen as fanciful at the time, many have proved accurate: CGI is routinely used to complete films if actors die, Pacino himself has been digitally de-aged on screen, holograms perform live concerts, and virtual actor Miquela – a 19-year-old Brazilian-American model/influencer – was signed last year by talent agency CAA. It also follows in the tradition of men attempting to create beautiful, subservient simulations of women, from Pygmalion carving Galatea out of ivory in Ovid’s Metamorphoses to films like Ex Machina and Blade Runner 2049. What makes the film work is how funny it is: it’s aware it’s a farce, though not, perhaps, the farce it thinks it is. It works least well when it’s trying to parody celebrity media frenzies – an easy and obvious target. But, watching it now, it is a biting satire of male ego and entitlement. Taransky is an affecting portrait of fragile masculinity: angry, resentful, needy, repeatedly emasculated by a fictional woman. The scenes in which we see him voicing Simone’s breathless praise (“Mr Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you … I was ones and zeros”) are imbued by Pacino with a remarkable amount of pathos. How much of this was intended is up for discussion. By puncturing Taransky’s arthouse pomposity, Niccol was evidently sending himself up in places. But the film is a little too enamoured with the shiny blonde avatar of S1m0ne; certain sequences would, nowadays, fall foul of #MeToo. All the female characters are defined by how supportive or otherwise they are of Taransky (the character who comes out of it best is his unfailingly adoring daughter). But, somehow, this adds an additional layer of entertainment. The film is in on about half the joke, which is the perfect ratio for cult film-making success: you are partly laughing at it, but also with it. It’s a snapshot of its time, with its creakily out-of-date technology and questionable sexual politics. It’s not the place to go to for cerebral conversations about technological singularity, but a fun, camp film in which an exceptional cast slightly embarrasses itself. I first watched it at some friends’ house late one night, and it was so good we got to the end and immediately watched it again. I defy anyone to watch Al Pacino – sorry, Pac1n0 – one of the greatest actors of all time, playing shadow puppets with a blond wig and a Barbie doll and not be at least a little bit charmed. S1m0ne is available to rent digitally in the US and the UK	926
“The history of the civil war was written by white men to serve their own agenda. It’s time for a black man to tell his own story.” The narrative emancipation practised by Emperor, though, is questionable, considering that more than a few liberties are taken with the story of Shields “Emperor” Green, the escaped slave who was hanged after storming Harpers Ferry with John Brown in 1859. Sadly, they are not taken with the same revisionist audacity as Quentin Tarantino gave Django Unchained, with whom this shares a producer. Here, rewriting history seems to consist solely of insisting that exciting gunpowder-keg explosions were a daily occurrence in the 19th century. Dayo Okeniyi plays Green, who snaps and murders his overseer after the latter whips his son for reading a book. Fleeing for his life, he tries to tap into the underground railroad – and is soon dogged by an elite bounty hunter (Ben Robson) chasing the $1,000 price tag on his head. Director Mark Amin keeps Green on a strict action-movie schedule, packing his journey with swamp manhunts, caravan chases and bank robberies. Historical accuracy obviously isn’t the point, and the pursuit is undeniably rousing, if not subtle. Next to the statuesque Okeniyi, almost every white character looks like a raddled Confederate cadaver. One thing Emperor is sharp on is the pressure on slaves – and former slaves – to pursue their own self-interest at the expense of their peers. “What is more important – freedom for one man or freedom for all man?” asks James Cromwell’s Brown when the less radical abolitionist Frederick Douglass (Harry Lennix) offers Green passage to Canada. More fine-grained attention to the psychological atmosphere of the period could have made this an antebellum The Fugitive, every scene full of fear and desperation. Instead, it’s merely watchable, a low-stakes contribution to the current renaissance of African American film-making. • Emperor is available on digital platforms from 1 March. • This article was amended on 24 February 2021 to correct the spelling of Frederick Douglass’s first name.	394
For the last two months, we’ve tasked Guardian writers with the unenviable: putting together an impassioned defence of a film loathed by the masses. From Lindsay Lohan’s stripper doppelgänger horror I Know Who Killed Me to Steven Spielberg’s CG gopher-wrecking Indiana Jones sequel, there have been some much-debated pleas but now we want to hear from you. We’ll continue to plumb the depths twice a week but what’s the one film that most hated that you loved? A one star superhero movie? A crowd-displeasing comedy? A flop horror? Let us know in the comments and we’ll assemble a list of the most convincing arguments.	126
Here is the story of the biggest prison escape in Chilean history. In 1990, during the final days of the Pinochet regime, 49 leftwing prisoners escaped from a Santiago jail via a 60-metre-long tunnel dug over 18 gruelling months with spoons and screwdrivers. Local newspapers called it “The Great Escape” and “An Escape for the Movies”; the event was a natural for the big screen. Jailbreak digs into this historic episode with thrilling oomph and awe. Much of the film’s pleasure derives from the ingenious ways the prisoners manage to dig the tunnel right under the noses of the watchful, sadistic guards. At one point, the crew use a pornographic poster to cover the opening to the crawl space where they would ultimately stack more than 50 tonnes of dirt. The guard takes no notice; he quips that the model is still wearing too many clothes. Later, the camera pulls back to reveal the real scope of the tunnel, all masterfully rigged with lights. Goosebumps. Although the construction of the tunnel overshadows the performances, the clash of personalities between the leaders of the break is engrossing enough. The quiet León Vargas (Benjamín Vicuña), who is still suffering from the loss of his family under the dictatorship, engineers the tunnel’s mechanics; the brassy Rafael Jiménez (Roberto Farías) remains the operation’s driving force. The female characters – the prisoners’ lawyer (Amparo Noguera) and Jiménez’s wife and outside liaison person (played by Francisca Gavilán) – add balance and nuance to an otherwise male-centric film. Exciting as it is, Jailbreak is hampered by sequences with stilted, over-expository dialogue that don’t do a great job of setting up the historical and ideological background; other than the prison conditions and the harsh death penalties awaiting seven of the prisoners, we don’t know much about the political stakes outside the jail’s four walls. Nevertheless, it’s an entertaining watch – particularly for a feature directorial debut – that alternates between moments of private turmoil and collective fervour. • Jailbreak is release on 1 March on digital platforms.	400
Not to be confused with Shadowlands, the 1993 drama featuring a heartbroken CS Lewis, or Shadowland, a documentary about a knife-maker, or any number of films called Shadowland. Even without seeing them, you can be assured that this particular Shadowland is, at least in terms of production values, the worst. Almost thrillingly inept, writer-director Simon Kay’s amateurish horror feature would be more amusing to criticise if only it weren’t so lacking in any signs of talent, from the impenetrable storytelling that jumps around chronologically, to the clueless editing, to the cinematography that looks as if it was done on an early smartphone. And the acting? Peerlessly inexpressive, unconvincing, dreary. In a supposedly ancient Scottish forest (the kind of ancient forest where all the trees are growing equally spaced in straight lines), there’s an abandoned military research base where an ill-defined, barely seen evil creature is running around killing anyone who wanders into its path. An American ambassador (David E Grimes), his wife and two grown-up kids, are being accompanied by a cadre of soldiers when – wouldn’t you know it? – a kidnapping goes wrong. The survivors run into a strange-looking old man (Tony Greengrass) who is revealed to be, I think, the same person we see in flashback as a younger man (Gordon Houston) arriving at the base to work on some experiment. It’s hard to be sure because nothing makes any sense. This really looks like the result of something written on the back of a beer mat and made over a drunken weekend in someone’s uncle’s garden. • Shadowland is released on digital platforms on 1 March.	323
Gwyneth Paltrow has been urged to stop spreading misinformation by the medical director of NHS England after she suggested long Covid could be treated with “intuitive fasting”, herbal cocktails and regular visits to an “infrared sauna”. The Hollywood star, who markets unproven new age potions on her Goop website, wrote on her latest blogpost that she caught Covid-19 early and had since suffered “long-tail fatigue and brain fog”. Paltrow said that after turning to the advice of a “functional medicine practitioner”, she was told “this was a case where the road to healing was going to be longer than usual”. She then embarked on a “keto and plant-based” diet, involving fasting until 11am every day, “lots of coconut aminos” and sugar-free kombucha and kimchi. Paltrow went on to recommend her brand’s Madame Ovary supplement and Seedlip, “the incredible herbal nonalcoholic cocktails”. She added: “I’m doing an infrared sauna as often as I can, all in service of healing.” Paltrow also suggested there was evidence for the efficacy of such a diet. “I’ve been doing major research and finding some great stuff to support what I’m doing,” she wrote. However, her unproven advice prompted a stern rebuke from Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director for NHS England, who urged influencers such as Paltrow against spreading misinformation. He said: “In the last few days I see Gwyneth Paltrow is unfortunately suffering from the effects of Covid. We wish her well, but some of the solutions she’s recommending are really not the solutions we’d recommend in the NHS.” Powis added: “We need to take long Covid seriously and apply serious science. All influencers who use social media have a duty of responsibility and a duty of care around that. “Like the virus, misinformation carries across borders and it mutates and it evolves. So I think YouTube and other social media platforms have a real responsibility and opportunity here.” In 2018 Goop agreed to pay a substantial settlement over unproven claims about the health benefits of the infamous vaginal eggs it was selling. It claimed the eggs could balance hormones, regulate menstrual cycles, prevent uterine prolapse, and increase bladder control, according to officials in Santa Clara, part of a group of California district attorneys who filed the lawsuit. Last year she began selling a This Smells Like My Vagina candle through her Goop brand. She later revealed that the follow-up would be called This Smells Like My Orgasm.	479
This horror is pretty crass and generic, yet there is occasionally a wacky gonzo energy to this film by director Mike P Nelson, the seventh movie in the Wrong Turn slasher franchise, which began back in 2003 in the classic 1970s style of The Hills Have Eyes. This is also a reboot or summation in that it is called, simply, Wrong Turn, like the first one, without the number seven. Charlotte Vega plays Jen, a fresh-faced twentysomething hiking the Appalachian trail with a group of her friends. After rashly deciding to go off the official path, into the dense woodland, in search of a “civil war fort” (an ominous destination if ever there was one), they are gruesomely set upon by sinister hillbillies and mountain men dressed in weird animal furs and skulls like Trumpites invading the Capitol. Jen’s earnest dad, Scott (Matthew Modine), comes looking for her, only to discover something horrifying about who these mountain folk actually are and the strange alternative society they have built in secret deep in the forest wilderness for a century or more. This film really is horribly violent, with people getting their skulls crushed, heads bashed in, ribcages collapsed and generally mutilated in all sorts of loathsome ways. It is by-the-numbers stuff, but the film starts to up its game when we find ourselves in the weird proto-postapocalyptic society in the hills that has stayed the same since the 19th century (but which, apparently, was founded on non-racial lines in opposition to the Confederacy and the Union). Jen gets a bit of a story arc that goes a little beyond the survivalist pieties of the Final Girl. It’s a bit silly and queasy, but the narrative motor keeps humming. • Wrong Turn is on digital platforms from 26 February.	340
Sadly, nowadays there is no video for this to go straight to. Maybe someone should reopen a branch of Blockbuster just so a VHS copy can be ceremoniously placed in a bargain bin by the exit. The Stylist lumbers heavily along as if it’s wearing deep-sea diver’s boots, a queasy mash-up of serial-killer nightmare with 90s-style Single White Female-esque thriller. The acting and directing are entirely terrible, the editing and pacing are so sluggish you’ll feel as if you’re going into a persistent vegetative state, the plot is tiresomely unthought-through, the split-screen shots don’t work and the musical score is so pointless and undifferentiated it sounds like elevator muzak. I do have to admit that the final wedding scene, with one particular cutaway shot of a beaming bridesmaid, does have a certain OTT outrageousness. But that doesn’t justify the price of admission – or of sitting through all that has gone before. Najarra Townsend plays a hair stylist named Claire who is really good at her job. Her way with the scissors and other sharp implements, and her tender scalp caresses, sooth her customers. But she has a habit of offering after-hours haircuts in the salon, giving her customers a late-night glass of wine into which she’s slipped something, and taking Hannibal-style trophies. Then, slightly out of the blue – and this doesn’t really mesh with her creepy MO – Claire forms an obsession with one of her regulars, Olivia (Brea Grant), which this leads to something truly yucky. Exasperatingly, this film fails to tell us something basic: how exactly is Claire moving and disposing of the corpses once she’s done her horrible number on them? Is she burying them? Keeping them in a freezer? One of her victims is the subject of “Missing” fliers put up around town – but later we hear that this same person is getting a “funeral”. So … they found the body? Or what? Either way, this movie has no vital signs. Available from 1 March on Arrow.	393
Adapted from a play by Terry Hughes, this pent-up and then purgatively violent drama revolves around an offscreen car accident that sends a handful of characters colliding into each other. Clearly already dancing a miserable tango of abuse, Nicole (Olivia Bonamy) and Steve (Ben Cura) come home to their isolated house in the country, decorated in shades of taupe, grey and plum to match Nicole’s bruises, after Steve runs over a stranger on the road on the way home from a party. Though he was driving and chose to leave the scene of the crime, he still blames Nicole for distracting him with an argument. As this display of toxic masculinity approaches its full operatic pitch, suddenly there’s someone at the door: policeman (Samuel West), all creepy chirpy banter, who’s wondering if they’ve seen anything strange lately. There’s quite a lot that’s strange here, including repeated chunks of dialogue that transfer from one character to another, the opaque motivations of several characters, and whether some of this is meant to be fantasy or just heavy-handed melodrama. Plus, there’s a mysterious second-act appearance from another creepy character named Sid, played by Anton Lesser (best known on TV for Game of Thrones and Wolf Hall). Lesser is the best thing in this, giving a layered performance that hints at a backstory that the actor at least may have conceived in detail even if the screenplay, credited to director Lawrence Gough and Alan Pattinson, doesn’t give him much to work with. Perhaps this worked better on stage, but as film it’s neither fish nor fowl, lacking neither the surrealism to give it a Lynchian dream logic, nor the psychological insight to make it work as realism. • Available on digital platforms.	344
The Dark and the Wicked is a nastily effective, lo-fi, psychological haunted house horror about a malevolent force that takes up residence in a remote Texas farmhouse (shot at director Bryan Bertino’s family home). There is possibly not a single scary moment here that will be new to horror fans, but Bertino directs with such technical flair that I yelped at most of them – and half-missed the others, eyes squeezed tight shut. Louise (Marin Ireland) is on a visit back to the farm where her bedridden dad (Michael Zagst) is dying. Her brother, Michael (Michael Abbott Jr), is here too, a hulking lunk in a lumberjack shirt who seems emotionally avoidant, rarely making eye contact. Everything about the farm feels creepy as hell: the sheep bleating in the barn, homemade wind chimes rattling. The land itself has a forsaken feel, abandoned by the younger generation. Refreshingly, Bertino’s emotionally literate script gives the family very real dynamics. Drinking beer on the porch one evening, the siblings experience a stab of guilt, realising how long it’s been since they last visited. What’s strange is that their mother (Julie Oliver-Touchstone) isn’t exactly welcoming. “I told you not to come,” she hisses. In her diary, she’s been writing about a diabolical force taking over the house. The first gruesome scare involves the mother chopping carrots with a very large knife. Worse is to come from the evil presence (named the Wicked in the credits), who the audience sees in the shadows in a couple of blood-run-cold “he’s behind you” moments. Wisely, Bertino exercises restraint, not revealing too much about the Wicked. But that does leave his script open to the accusation of narrative thinness – and with the bodies piling up, you’d expect a cop or two to come sniffing around. • Released on 25 February on Shudder.	373
The screenwriter William Goldman cautioned against making predictions in the movie business with the line: “Nobody knows anything.” That said, there is one thing we do know: global events leave their mark on cinema – and things don’t get much bigger than a worldwide pandemic. And not always in the ways you’d expect. So, if we’re looking for clues about films that will be released in the years to come, is cinema history any help? The pandemic is the biggest global crisis since the second world war, and, if we look back to the cinema of that era, one trend in particular stands out: the arrival of film noir. Classics of the genre, such as The Postman Always Rings Twice, Double Indemnity and The Killers, were dark, cynical tales about murder plots, manipulative women and morally compromised men. Might post-Covid cinema take an equally dark turn? Possibly – though film-makers and audiences may need a bit of a break first. Ed Guiney, producer of the Oscar-winning films Room and The Favourite, told me: “I don’t feel the desire to watch something that speaks directly to the pandemic.” Instead, he’s craving films that are “enjoyable” and “exuberant”. So expect a deluge of musicals, romances or comedies. However, with sufficient distance, it’s inevitable that Covid will show up in cinema in one shape or another – but that shape may well be an alien, monster or zombie. When America has come under threat in the past, it has often used genre as a way of telling the story. During the cold war years, the fear of nuclear annihilation sparked a sci-fi boom, with films such as The Day the Earth Stood Still, Invasion of the Body Snatchers and The Blob. And, after 9/11, horror of all stripes became popular, from big-budget disaster films such as Spielberg’s War of the Worlds to that B-movie favourite: zombies. Kevin J Wetmore, author of Post 9/11 Horror in American Cinema, has a theory about zombies: “They’re angry, they’re fast; they want to convert you to their way of life. Zombies are, he says, “a stand-in for Islamist terrorism”. Zombies also seem like an obvious metaphor for a contagious disease. But Andy Willis, professor of film studies at the University of Salford, says this time around we’re unlikely to turn to the walking undead. Perhaps because zombies have been done to death over the past couple of decades. Instead, Willis says genre film may see stories similar to those of the 50s, in which there is an unseen monster that appears from nowhere or where people are struggling to find an explanation for the threat. That makes sense. Covid, at least in the panicky first few weeks of the pandemic, had much in common with nuclear anxiety. It was invisible and not fully understood and yet seemed as if it had the potential to destroy the world. We’re still very much in the middle of the crisis. And perhaps the mood and direction of cinema will depend on how well we can get a handle on the virus. Sci-fi in the 50s was, for the most part, hopeful about the world’s resilience – or at least America’s. The government or scientists usually managed to defeat the extraterrestrials and order was restored. Today, we may have lost faith in government, but, so far at least, scientists seem to be doing a good job of saving the day. On the other hand, Covid-19, though deadly, doesn’t provoke the same visceral terror as a plane flying into a building or nuclear annihilation. Instead, for many of us, this past year has been (to borrow a phrase from an article in Wired magazine) “‘perilously boring”. It has poured fire on everyday issues: burnout, relationship tensions, money worries, loneliness. And it’s in this domestic pressure cooker that Wetmore believes film-makers will find inspiration. “I think we’ll see films that deal with isolation or being trapped,” he says. And paranoid stories in which “the person with whom I share my life must now be a stranger until we can find out if it’s safe”. Films may also reflect the societal shifts, both profound and small, that Covid has ushered in – and in some cases, they are already doing so. In the creepy horror Host, released in 2020, all the action plays out over Zoom. Just as, in the post-9/11 years, there was an explosion in found-footage films that mirrored the way the world watched the attack on the twin towers – in real time, on a shaky videocam. As the months roll on and vaccines neuter the virus, our attention might turn away from danger to the things we’ve missed. Such as human connection. As film industry data researcher Stephen Follows suggests: “The first person who releases a film that is nothing but 90 minutes of people hugging and just hanging out in social environments – that’s going to be a blockbuster.”	988
Paramount has become the latest studio to unveil plans for a streaming service it hopes will help maximise profits on films whose release has been affected by the pandemic. Paramount Plus, which launches on 4 March, will feature archive content as well as carrying new movies 30 days after theatrical release – or 45 for tentpole titles. These include oft-postponed releases such as Top Gun: Maverick (due in cinemas on 2 July), A Quiet Place II (17 September) and Mission: Impossible 7 (19 November). “Audiences are changing in their habits and we want to make sure that these films are available when they’re fresh after a full theatrical run,” Paramount Pictures CEO Jim Gianopulos told Variety on Wednesday. Mission: Impossible 7 wrapped filming last week after a long-running shoot involving multiple restarts in a wide variety of locations. Post-production is now under way in London ahead of the proposed release over the Thanksgiving weekend holiday in the US. The move is another blow for cinema owners seeking to shore up trade post-lockdown. Disney and Warner Bros have already launched popular streaming services either in tandem with a cinematic release or – particularly in the US, where most venues have been closed for almost a year – as standalone platforms. Universal recently struck a deal with key US chains that would allow them to stream new titles after only 17 days in cinemas. Paramount also announced TV series based on hit movies such as The Italian Job, Love Story, Flashdance and Fatal Attraction.	282
There have been so many additions to the Hellraiser franchise since the first one debuted in 1987 that we’ve now got to the stage when it’s best not to remind viewers how many there have been, lest the young uns think it’s some kind of musty Gen X thing that just won’t die. Which it kind of is, to be honest. This latest contribution, written and directed by makeup effects specialist Gary J Tunnicliffe, feels like a pretty degraded mutation from the original concept. Where the first few Hellraisers had an interesting if somewhat icky erotic tang to them – alluding to S&amp;M/fetish culture as much as horror, and featuring female protagonists – Judgment is less about desire than just straight-up misogyny and gory, gross-out money shots. The franchise’s iconic demon Pinhead is back once again (of course), played here by Paul T Taylor. But he’s more of a background presence as an assortment of other demons, including one played by Tunnicliffe himself, take over the business of bedevilling humanity via what sounds like insurance industry-based methods of torture, given they call themselves The Auditor, The Assessor and whatnot. Among the living, the main characters are a trio of cops – two of them brothers Sean (Damon Carney) and David Carter (Randy Wayne), as well as rookie Christine (Alexandra Harris) – who are investigating what seems to be a serial killer case. One of the first victims is a young woman (Grace Montie) who dares to be sexually active, and ends up with her lapdog and mobile phone sewn up inside her body. Elsewhere, there’s a trio of supernatural vamps who sit in judgment over souls and have fake blood hosed on to their large naked breasts, which I guess is one way to get your jollies. The dialogue is execrable, which partly excuses the inert performances; the sets – including one that looks like a shop’s filament bulb display – are more interesting to look at than the actors. • Released on 22 February on digital platforms.	397
“Guns are for LASSIES! Nobody seems to put the BOOT in any more!” This rousing manifesto for muscular non-armed crime of the traditional sort comes from one of the hardened villains that surreally pop up in this intensely likable Scottish caper from 1985, with a soundtrack from Big Country. It was part of a boom in Britmovie comedy of the era when Scotland was becoming caustically alienated from Thatcherite England, and which gave us Bill Forsyth’s Gregory’s Girl, Comfort and Joy and Local Hero. The script from Ninian Dunnett was originally the winning entry of a screenwriting competition (Dunnett in fact wrote no more for the screen after this, and became an author and social historian) and it was directed by the anglophile and caledonophile American Michael Hoffman. Joe Mullaney plays Ronnie, a likely Edinburgh lad who works in a joke shop, like Miranda Hart. He and his nervy mate Will (Vincent Friell) decide they’re sick of being poor and resolve to tour around the countryside on their motorbike, in a clown and wolfman disguise, robbing tourist buses – which they do so politely that they become folk heroes. Bryan Forbes and Nanette Newman provide cameos as a grumpy English couple who assume they’re a student “rag week” stunt and fob them off with one of the big 50p coins of the day. But when the lads’ criminal career takes off, a mean American cop over here on holiday, played by Ned Beatty, gets on their trail with his flashy big mobile phone (“It’s the Man from UNCLE!” giggle the local officers) and tension emerges between the two bandits. Will finds himself romantically involved with Margot (Teri Lally), a tour guide on a bus he’d just stuck up, and Ronnie falls in some with serious villains, led by a deadpan Mel Smith. Kids keep cropping up in the action – unsentimental and unimpressed by both the cops and the robbers. It’s the kind of gentle and yet sweetly funny use of children that British cinema just doesn’t do any more. Ronnie and Will are in some ways innocent forerunners of Renton, Spud et al in Trainspotting, and also a prototype Wallace and Gromit. Released on 1 March on digital platforms.	432
The titles of Spider-Man movies have not traditionally told us a whole lot about their storylines. It wasn’t until Marvel took over the franchise with Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) that we even got so much as a hint of what was about to take place in each forthcoming instalment. And yet this week’s announcement that Tom Holland’s third solo outing as the teenage superhero will be called Spider-Man: No Way Home has got the geekosphere buzzing. Perhaps it’s because there are so many clues out there already that the next film in the series will go way off the beaten track. On the big screen, Spider-Man has always existed largely in his own New York back yard, bar the odd jaunt into outer space in the Avengers movies and his holiday to Europe in Spider-Man: Far from Home (2019). But, taken together with reports that the new film will delve deeply into the Marvel multiverse, along with the bizarre goings-on in the Disney+ TV series WandaVision, there’s a sense that it might be a while before we see Peter Parker hanging with Aunt May in Queens any time soon. The most likely outcome here is that No Way Home sees Spidey spinning into multiple alternate universes while struggling to get back to his own. We already know that Jamie Foxx’s Electro (who last appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 in 2014) and Alfred Molina’s Doctor Octopus (last seen in 2004’s Spider-Man 2) will make appearances. As both were effectively part of other Spider-Man universes – where the wall-crawler was played by Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire, for another studio (Sony) – we know something unusual must be going on. That Benedict Cumberbatch’s Doctor Strange, whose next movie is subtitled In the Multiverse of Madness, will also play a part rather seals the deal. Holland has denied live on TV that Maguire and Garfield are also due to appear as versions of Spidey, though that doesn’t mean the pair won’t eventually show up in some form. It would be just like Marvel to pull off some last-minute sleight-of-hand – perhaps the versions of Peter Parker in these alternate universes were never bitten by a radioactive spider, for instance. Perhaps they ended up becoming other superheroes, or alternate versions of Spider-Man (giving Holland ultra-useful plausible deniability). In any case, as Holland also pointed out in his chat with The Tonight Show’s Jimmy Fallon, it’s not as if Marvel tells him absolutely everything. Eagle-eyed fans have also spotted potential links in publicity for No Way Home to WandaVision: the subtle hexagons appearing here and there on the whiteboard reveal at the end of the film’s teaser trailer seem to reference Wanda Maximoff’s bizarre habit of keeping the town of Westfield, New Jersey inside a giant, protective, six-sided forcefield. Since she’s clearly capable of bending reality to her will, and will also turn up in Multiverse of Madness, might Wanda’s powers (and her ungodly determination to bring Paul Bettany’s Vision back from the dead) be responsible for fracturing the multiverse and causing various realities to bleed into each other, with devastating results? If so, Marvel fans won’t mind at all. The chance to experience a pick’n’mix of Spider-Man’s best movie moments over the past 20 years, while ignoring all the bad ones (no place for Rhys Ifans’ awful CGI Lizard, we hope) is too tempting to resist. And yet anyone expecting No Way Home to play out like a live-action version of the Oscar-winning Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse should cool their boots. Marvel almost always finds a way to refresh story beats from its source comics in delightfully unexpected ways when they turn up on the big screen, and if the studio is going to start cribbing from Sony’s movies we should expect them to follow the same routine. If Spidey really is to leave the streets of Queens for alternate versions of the Big Apple, at least this solves one major issue for Peter Parker, who was exposed as Spider-Man at the end of Far from Home by Jake Gyllenhaal’s false Mysterio. Who’s to say that, by the time reality resets itself, one of the unexpected byproducts of this multiversal course correction doesn’t turn out to be that Parker’s secret identity has been conveniently restored?	836
An unusual awards season kicks off this weekend with the delayed Golden Globes, a ceremony that’s long been the butt of many an industry joke but this year, its standing has gone from bad to worse after a flood of controversy. The Hollywood Foreign Press Association, a group of 87 international journalists who vote on the awards, has come under fire after the Los Angeles Times published two damning exposés on both the questionable credentials of members and the ease at which they are reportedly courted by studios. The non-profit organisation has been accused of “ethical lapses” with members reportedly flown to Paris in support of the Netflix comedy Emily in Paris, which received two nominations, while also being paid nearly $2m by the group between 2019 and 2020. The lack of diversity (there isn’t a single black member) has also been criticised in a year when a number of black performances, films and shows have been ignored. Michaela Coel’s universally acclaimed drama I May Destroy You failed to secure a single nomination while One Night in Miami, Judas and the Black Messiah, Da 5 Bloods and Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom were all ignored in the best picture category. “That I May Destroy You did not get one Golden Globe nod is not only wrong, it’s what is wrong with everything,” wrote Deborah Copaken, a writer for Emily in Paris. “How anyone can watch I May Destroy You and not call it a brilliant work of art or Michaela Coel a genius is beyond my capacity to understand how these decisions are made.” On Thursday, the HFPA released a statement responding to criticism. “We understand that we need to bring in black members, as well as members from other underrepresented backgrounds, and we will immediately work to implement an action plan to achieve these goals as soon as possible,” it read. The LA Times investigation comes soon after a lawsuit was filed against the HFPA by the Norwegian journalist Kjersti Flaa, who was denied membership and accused them of a “culture of corruption” with members accepting “thousands of dollars in emoluments” from studios and celebrities. The suit was dismissed by a judge, partly because Flaa could not prove any economic or professional hardship as a result. The HFPA’s lead lawyer called it “a transparent attempt to shake down the HFPA based on jealousy, not merit”. Sunday’s ceremony itself will be yet another combination of the physical and the virtual, with Covid-19 safety precautions requiring all nominees to stay at home. The HFPA has also warned against any unsupervised gatherings, with California this week becoming the first US state to cross 50,000 virus-related deaths. The night will be hosted by Tina Fey in New York and Amy Poehler in Los Angeles with presenters, including Kristen Wiig and Joaquin Phoenix, appearing in person following strict protocols. “It’s full-on weird,” Poehler said to the New York Times. “And we’re hoping that the weirdness, which people are unfortunately used to at this point, will translate into something fun and interesting.” The film field is led by David Fincher’s Mank, an ode to old Hollywood made for Netflix, including a best actor in a drama nomination for star Gary Oldman, who previously referred to the Globes as “fucking ridiculous” and “90 nobodies having a wank”. Oldman is predicted to lose out to Chadwick Boseman, for his role in Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom. Boseman died in 2020 from colon cancer and his two final performances, in Rainey and Da 5 Bloods, have so far won him 20 posthumous awards with more on the way. It could well be a big night for British talent, after last year saw Fleabag, Chernobyl and 1917 win big, with Carey Mulligan primed to pick up the best actress in a drama prize for her role in fiery rape revenge thriller Promising Young Woman, Daniel Kaluuya set to be named best supporting actor for the Black Panthers biopic Judas and the Black Messiah and Sacha Baron Cohen favourite to win best actor in a comedy for Borat Subsequent Moviefilm. Within the TV categories, it’s likely to be a strong showing for Netflix’s chess drama The Queen’s Gambit and star Anya Taylor-Joy, while the recent seasons of The Crown and Schitt’s Creek should also perform well. While the lack of racial diversity has come under fire, the nominations did break new ground for female film-makers with a record three women nominated for best director: Regina King for One Night in Miami, Chloé Zhao for Nomadland and Emerald Fennell for Promising Young Woman. Only five female directors have ever been nominated in the Globes’ 78-year history The ceremony comes just a week before voting begins for this year’s Oscars, which will take place on 25 April.	915
When The Dilemma opened in January 2011 it was met with critical contempt and box office apathy. Audiences then and now are befuddled by it and every scathing review asks the same question: “What kind of movie is this supposed to be?” It’s too serious for a comedy but too silly for a drama. It’s too bro-tastic for a satire but too incisive for a mindless frat pack foray. It has very insightful jokes and very crass jokes. By all accounts, it’s a mess. But I argue, that while the film is messy, it’s not a mess. Enjoying The Dilemma is made easier with a pre-existing appreciation for three things: sincere displays of platonic male love, postcard-perfect pictures of Chicago and Ron Howard’s quietly impressive craftsmanship. But even then, to fully embrace The Dilemma also requires a tolerance for tonal discordance and a sociological interest in the bridge between the earnestness of the bromance and the gender hegemony of toxic masculinity. Vaughn stars as Ronny and Kevin James plays Nick, his best friend and business partner. They run a small automotive design firm that’s on the verge of a long-term contract with Dodge. Ronny and Nick both have stunning significant others played by Jennifer Connelly and Winona Ryder. Everything is looking up until Ronny sees Geneva (Ryder) cheating on Nick with a young hunk (Channing Tatum in a hilarious, off-kilter performance). Enter the titular dilemma: should Ronny tell Nick what he saw? Enter a complication: Nick is under pressure to produce his concept for a big meeting with Dodge. If Ronny is to tell Nick at all, should he wait until after the meeting for the sake of their business? Funny, right? Well, yes and no. And that’s why so many viewers are turned off by the film. Right from the opening credits, Howard signals this isn’t a generic studio comedy. As we see our four leads engaged in lively conversation at a trendy restaurant, Howard intercuts between gorgeous closeups and stark black-and-white credits. The dialogue proves similarly disorienting as it rapidly switches between small talk, philosophical inquiry and one-liners. It feels like an unstable blend of John Cassavetes, Woody Allen and Judd Apatow, an alchemy that bubbles throughout the entire movie, making for a simultaneously off-putting and stimulating experience. In a way, The Dilemma has aged better than you’d expect. Ten years later, stereotyping dialogue seems less like casual racism and more like stealthy commentary on privileged white males (which was essentially Howard’s defense when a line in the film about electric cars being “gay” rightfully drew controversy). In an easier film, the male leads would be glorified and the film’s sharp edges sanded down. But Nick is neither infallible nor pure and Ronny’s quest is not strictly virtuous. And an easier film would be less sincere in a pivotal scene where Ronny and Nick speak to each other – in front of a group – with the kind of earnestness so rarely spoken between men (in film or in real life). Instead of playing it tongue-in-cheek, the film bravely hangs with its characters as they share the kind of vulnerability normally coded as weak. But what The Dilemma does differently from the more genial and successful bromances is acknowledge how male friendship can devolve into the type of “bros before hoes” mentality associated with toxic masculinity. The film’s conclusion at the United Center is both rousing and unsettling. Ronny and Nick experience unadulterated male wish fulfillment while the female characters are either absent or left on the sidelines. Throughout, Ronny’s relationship with Beth (Connelly) feels both far-fetched and sadly true to life. In the end, he gets the girl, gets the job and gets a bros trip while his fiancee simply gets the good fortune of being engaged to him. And yet, I admit the amount of time spent squirming because something’s too serious or not serious enough makes for an exhausting watch. I can’t fault anyone who finds Ronny’s anniversary toast unbearably cringe-inducing or the Chicago botanical garden scene to be ludicrously slapstick. In the end, there may be scenes you wish played out differently or jokes you wish were cut, but there lies the film’s strength: it’s deliberately not the movie anyone wants it to be. By being messy and free from conformity, The Dilemma can explore the insidious undercurrents of the bromances without sacrificing the infectious joviality of male bonding. That peculiar balance is what enables The Dilemma to get at some hard truths and some hard laughs. And that’s what makes it worth watching. The Dilemma is available to rent digitally in the US and UK	900
By age 19, the singer Billie Eilish has reached heights of fame and success that feel both otherworldly and familiar, carried by the same tides of generational mega-popularity that have buoyed such teen music idols as Britney Spears and Miley Cyrus before her, but with a Gen Z twist. It’s Eilish publicity canon that the then-15-year-old rocketed to social media fame after her older brother and co-producer, Finneas, posted a song they recorded for her dance class, Ocean Eyes, to Soundcloud, that they recorded her smash debut album, When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? in his childhood bedroom, that the two MacGyver everyday sounds – a dentist’s drill, the slurp of Eilish’s Invisalign retainer – into songs that garner billions of streams. These are not myths; as captured in RJ Cutler’s mesmerizing and generous Apple TV+ documentary The World’s a Little Blurry, Eilish did, indeed, spend these supersonic teenage years at her family’s modest house in Los Angeles; she and Finneas do compose their music in his bedroom with such organic sibling telepathy it seems almost too casual to be the omnipresent dark-pop hits Bad Guy or Bury a Friend. But over the course of nearly two and a half hours, The World’s a Little Blurry offers a fascinating rejoinder to any cynicism that this could be image maintenance for a teenage superstar. The verité-style documentary, filmed from late 2018 through Eilish’s Grammys sweep in 2020 (11 awards, including album of the year), observes an enviably talented and more enviably self-possessed young woman handling the twin rocketships of superstardom and adolescence with astounding awareness, if not always control. The trust afforded to Cutler (The War Room, The September Issue) by Eilish’s family – mom Maggie Baird and father Patrick O’Connell, both near-constant presences – is evident. The camera roves through the family home, dropping in on family arguments (Maggie and Finneas, and then Eilish, arguing over the latter’s reluctance to make an “accessible” hit) and Eilish’s bedroom the morning of her Grammy nominations. The film glides on the always-magnetic juxtaposition of superstardom weirdness with relatability – Eilish DM-ing her idol, Justin Bieber, posting to her millions of Instagram followers, selecting her signature baggy couture outfits for tour; Eilish studying for her driver’s permit, complaining about her family’s lame cars, or groaning when her father compares new music to a Duncan Sheik song. It also includes all the promises of authenticity we’ve come to expect from modern music documentaries: quiet moments, the stress of touring, the vertigo of rapid-onset fame, work process competency porn. But whereas Taylor Swift’s Miss Americana, released last year on Netflix, often felt like a meticulous, if entertaining, propaganda project, The World’s a Little Blurry portrays an artist for whom the idea of “authenticity” is both artistically important and for filming, passé. Eilish was born in 2001 and grew up accustomed to documentation, by family and oneself; as she told Colbert this week, “I don’t really change in front of a camera.” Part of the hook of The World’s a Little Blurry’s is to watch a star who understands, as do her fans who grew up on Snapchat and Instagram, that to be on camera is to be both yourself and not – the calibration is so fluid, and so ubiquitous, as to be nearly indistinguishable, or maybe more accurately, irrelevant, to “real” life. Thus Cutler’s film feels like watching Eilish be Eilish, even as she mugs to the camera in the style of her favorite show, The Office. The film has its fair share of intimate moments: a tic-attack from her Tourette’s, a forlorn phone call with a distant, inattentive (now-ex) boyfriend she has not previously discussed with the public, quiet backstage disappointment with what she considers to be a subpar Coachella performance (“You forgot some words to a new song, big deal, who cares?” O’Connell, consistently the most dad of dads, supplies). Its strongest element, aside from Eilish herself, is the generosity and empathy afforded to the experience of fandom. Eilish, so devoted to Bieber as a 12-year-old that Baird considered putting her in therapy, speaks fluently of the hyper-intense adoration lobbed at her by millions, predominantly teenage girls. When she breaks down for a full 30 seconds upon meeting him, in one of The World’s a Little Blurry’s best scenes, it may as well be any one of the crying, alight faces in her crowds. The chasmic emotion, the consuming devotion for your artistic heroes, the way it makes even the darkest recesses of your brain feel temporarily OK – that, for Eilish, her fans, and viewers, is strikingly real. Billie Eilish: The World’s a Little Blurry is available on Apple TV+ from 26 February	953

“It was called ‘the United States of America versus Billie Holiday,’” wrote the jazz legend in her 1956 autobiography, “and that’s just the way it felt.” Holiday’s 1947 conviction, when she was sentenced to a year and a day for possession of narcotics, was just one chapter in a sustained campaign against the singer, whose performances of Abel Meeropol’s anguished, anti-lynching ballad Strange Fruit had become a lightning rod for civil rights awareness and activism. Holiday’s steadfast refusal to stop singing that song was perhaps the greatest indication of her indomitable spirit, forged in the fires of a tough-as-nails upbringing that saw her survive horrific childhood abuse to become a superstar in an age of often deadly racial and sexual prejudice. Yet in Precious director Lee Daniels’s timely but muddled biopic, which boasts a revelatory performance by Andra Day, the authorities’ harassment of Holiday is given a perverse romantic twist in the shape of a federal agent ordered to spy on the star. Trevante Rhodes, who proved such a mesmerising presence in Barry Jenkins’s Moonlight, is Jimmy Fletcher, the handsome undercover narc assigned to infiltrate Holiday’s inner circle, gathering evidence of her drug use. Yet even when Jimmy’s occupation is revealed, the singer and her entourage continue to tolerate his presence. Indeed, Jimmy’s sympathetic attentions are starkly juxtaposed with Holiday’s otherwise abusive relationships with men – the partners, husbands and managers who often seem more like pimps. Fletcher may have been instructed by racist war on drugs chief Harry Anslinger (Garrett Hedlund) to take Billie down, but he finds himself sharing both her confidence and her bed, even shooting up heroin with her to prove his allegiance. The speculative relationship at the heart of Pulitzer-winning playwright/novelist Suzan-Lori Parks’s script appears to be rooted in a passing claim by Johann Hari (author of the film’s credited source book Chasing the Scream) that “the man Anslinger sent to track and bust Billie Holiday had, it seems, fallen in love with her”. Certainly Fletcher was on record as feeling conflicted about his role in Holiday’s legal travails, and she later wrote to him, saying: “Most federal agents are nice people … Maybe they would have been kinder to me if they had been nasty; then I wouldn’t have trusted them enough to believe what they told me.” Yet foregrounding this presumed romance seems bizarre when the verifiable details of Holiday’s life are so compelling, particularly since the spectre of a singer being silenced for performing a quietly incendiary song clearly has drama to spare. Like Sidney J Furie’s uneven 1972 biopic Lady Sings the Blues, for which Diana Ross received a deserved best actress Oscar nomination, Daniels’s problematic movie – which careens wildly between stagey interviews, hallucinatory horrors and audacious musical set pieces – rests squarely upon the shoulders of a singer turned actor who breathes cinematic life into a musical icon. Day really is a dazzling screen presence, capturing the poise and raw power of her subject, whether performing on stage with an orchid in her hair and bandages around her bruised ribs, or delivering a slap between numbers in a heady whirlwind of world tour highs and lows. As James Erskine’s recent documentary Billie demonstrated, Holiday transcended the trite label of “victim”, and Day invests her performance with a vibrant strength that cannot be quelled, even in the most appalling circumstances. Top-notch production design by Daniel T Dorrance (aided by a monochrome-to-colour editing device reminiscent of The Night They Raided Minsky’s), eye-catching costume work by Paolo Nieddu and handsome cinematography by Andrew Dunn (whose credits include Daniels’s Precious and The Butler) lend a glossy sheen to the often chaotic proceedings. But this is Day’s show all the way, and her performance remains the film’s strongest suit. • On Sky Cinema	745
Tony Stone’s Ted K is an eerily plausible and unsettlingly mesmeric realisation of the inner world of Ted Kaczynski: that is, the private life of the “Unabomber”, America’s most notorious domestic terrorist who, working largely from his primitive cabin in the Montana wilderness, killed three people and injured 22 more in a mail-bombing campaign lasting from 1978 to 1995, ostensibly in pursuit of an eco-fundamentalist crusade against all modern technology. Staggeringly, his campaign induced the Washington Post in 1995 to publish his rambling manifesto in return for a promised cessation of bombing. Something which had seemed like a catastrophic capitulation to terror turned out to be a smart move against it, when Kaczynski’s estranged brother recognised his writing and alerted the authorities. As ever with true-crime movies like this, good or bad, there is a strange, transgressive and slightly nauseous undertow to the viewing experience, knowing that the real protagonist is still alive, behind bars, the shadowy original author of everything on screen, but certainly not invited to participate in any promotional Zoom Q&amp;A — though perhaps one day permitted to see the film himself. The South African actor Sharlto Copley plays Ted: a fierce, gaunt, angry man, whose sharp and rather distinguished features are mostly blurred by a straggly beard. He is a former brilliant mathematician and college professor who turned away from academe in favour of a radical hermit existence. Stone films a queasily black-comic scene in which Ted makes a furious phone call to his mother from one of the pre-internet, pre-smartphone telephone booths of the era, ranting that she had ruined his emotional and sexual life by pushing him academically too early, and that he has still never got beyond first base with a woman — “rubbing tongues”. “Well, who else am I supposed to tell this to?” he screams at her. (One answer might be his estranged brother David, but the topic of conversation there is not sex but money, and how David should lend him some.) Otherwise, we see Ted making a few dollars here and there with menial jobs, including at one of the hated logging companies, where he gets fired for making sneerily sexist comments to the female manager. He also one stage, bizarrely, has a job tutoring a local teenage kid in mathematics, and appears conscientious and good at it. But Copley and Stone show how Kaczynski is driven by hate and revenge. He spends some of his time in creepy serial-killer home-invader mode, breaking into the luxury cabin of vacationers who wreck the environment with their noisy snowmobiles, on a mission to destroy these devilish means of transport with his axe. But Kaczynski has no desire for face-to-face violence. He just has a monkish vocation for building bombs (as a scientist, he would have had the brainpower for the job, and if he used that notorious instruction manual, The Anarchist’s Cookbook, it isn’t mentioned here.) The movie spends long stretches of time alongside Kaczynsski he roams the forests of his mind, or haunts the desolate roadways and back-alleys, smugly awaiting a detonation. He smiles really just once: on hearing of the Washington Post’s capitulation to his demands. Kaczynski affects an interest in Joseph Conrad (presumably the novel The Secret Agent) and uses Conrad as an alias sometimes. But in literary terms, he is closer to the vengeful Christie Malry in BS Johnson’s novel — or perhaps the lonely, driven Lee Harvey Oswald in Don DeLillo’s Libra. We see how Kaczynski has become part of the nation’s popular culture: on magazine covers and news programmes in the form of the police-artist sketch of a figure in sunglasses and hoodie — for a delirious moment he is of equal status as OJ Simpson being chased in his white Ford Bronco, a weird harbinger of celebrity culture. It is a riveting, dreamlike evocation of this man’s tortured, unhappy life, whose transient successes bring him no pleasure of any kind. •Premieres at the Berlin film festival.	768
A high-school movie directed by Amy Poehler, the SNL comedy blackbelt who starred in Parks and Recreation? And who is incidentally the longtime performing partner of Tina Fey, who created the high-school classic Mean Girls? Is this going to be hilarious, or what? Sadly no. Solemnly based on a novel by YA author Jennifer Mathieu, Moxie could be called Nice Girls or Mutually Supportive Girls. Poehler herself has a small role as the single mom of a smart, lonely teenage girl called Vivian (Hadley Robinson) who is best friends with Claudia (Lauren Tsai), but whose intimacy with her is about to be damaged by her admiration for supercool new girl Lucy (Alycia Pascual-Peña), and her growing romantic situation with the impeccably right-on and pro-feminist supportive guy Seth (Nico Hiraga). Enraged by the boorish, sexist behaviour of the obnoxious football star Mitchell (Patrick Schwarzenegger), and the way he is indulged by the school, Vivian gets inspired by her mom’s long-since forgotten protest persona, and she starts a zine called Moxie and triggers a feminist revolution at the school which challenges her friendships and her sense of herself. The film is intensely, almost radically humourless, which is hard to ignore and in fact hard to bear, because of this film’s obvious resemblance to recent great movies like Booksmart or Lady Bird and particularly at times the hard-edged classic Election. In fact, Moxie feels like someone has put those films through a machine for extracting the comedy and the political satire. The movie tackles diversity, bullying and rape, but does it all very glibly. The target audience will surely be aware of the canon of superior, funny movies – and they will be baffled to see that Poehler doesn’t want to do something similar. • Released on 3 March on Netflix.	344
In any other year, the first night of the Berlin film festival would see crowds packing into the Berlinale Palast, the giant cinema off the Potsdamer Platz that acts as the festival’s main hub. But like every other film festival, Berlin has been forced to completely rethink itself in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The major festivals have taken different approaches. Sundance and Toronto opted to move most of their activity online – albeit with limited “in-person” screenings – staging digital premieres and events. Cannes, with its commitment to the cinema experience, decided to cancel rather than stream its films, and has pushed its next edition to a more audience-friendly summer time-slot. Berlin has chosen a middle way: this week sees a “virtual” event for press and industry representatives, featuring digital screenings of its selected films, followed by a “physical” event in June, Covid restrictions permitting. Organisers were torn to lose the buzz and excitement that is a key part of the live festival experience. Carlo Chatrian, Berlinale’s artistic director, says the decision to split the festival into a press/industry event and a public one was down to its connection with the local audience. “We are so closely related to the place where the audience is based that we felt the best option was to ask them to wait a bit to benefit from an in-presence event.” He added that one of the festival’s main goals is to support cinemas in Berlin and throughout Germany. So what can Chatrian expect from a virtual festival? If the experience of Sundance in 2021 is anything to go by, digital screenings can significantly increase audience figures. Sundance recorded more than two and a half times the viewers, compared to the previous year’s cinema-based format. This is born out by the Glasgow film festival, currently in the middle of its run, which also decided to opt for a virtual format. Allison Gardner, the festival’s CEO, says “ticket buying has so far exceeded our expectations”, with the festival more than doubling the audience for its opening film, the Korean-American drama Minari, selling over 1,400 tickets for an event that would normally show in a 600-capacity cinema. Virtual screenings present their own difficulties, however: films are geoblocked to the UK to prevent clashes with overseas distributors, and audience numbers are limited to prevent overexposure of individual titles. “It wouldn’t be fair to the film-makers otherwise,” says Gardner. Like Berlin, Glasgow is committed to reaching a wide audience: Gardner says: “We have a lot of free screenings because we are trying to break down barriers, and we also work with young people, we have a lot of community engagement. That’s very, very difficult to replicate online.” Rich Cline, chair of the London Critics’ Circle, agrees that virtual festivals don’t have all the answers. “There are some obvious benefits,” he says, “which gives the films and the festival itself a much wider base of coverage. On the other hand, watching these films at home, even on a large TV screen, is simply not the best way to experience them. The biggest sacrifice is the communal thrill of a live audience’s reaction to seeing something unexpected for the very first time.” He adds: “Even after pandemic restrictions are lifted, it might be an experience that’s either lost forever or limited to a lucky few from now on.” One way forward for the virtual festival could be the same as Cheltenham film festival, which used its experience as one of the first events to make the leap to digital by configuring its streaming platform YourScreen to act as a distributor/exhibitor for films that would otherwise be unlikely to get a UK release. Leslie Montgomery Sheldon, director of both YourScreen and the Cheltenham film festival, says they took the step “based on the positive feedback we had from members of the public who attended our online film festival in June 2020. We were told they would like to have the opportunity to watch new films and good independent films online.” YourScreen shows around 10 films over two months, via a revenue-share partnership with real-world independent cinemas, not unlike the popular independent-film platform established by Modern Films. Sheldon says that, so far, their best performing titles have been the otherwise unheralded Canadian film And the Birds Rained Down and a Polish film called Supernova, not to be confused with the Colin Firth/Stanley Tucci drama. Sheldon says it is financially viable and after the pandemic they plan to keep going. “We are here for the long term.” In Glasgow, Gardner is similarly optimistic “We’ll look at the positives and see what we can embed next time. It’s about learning the lessons and looking at the opportunities to engage. I don’t think there’ll be any return to business as usual, to be honest – but I’m still desperate to get back into a cinema.” The Berlin film festival runs 1-5 March, and the Glasgow film festival until 7 March	961
While films such as Traffic and Sicario focused on the supply side of the US war on drugs, John Swab’s third feature takes on the demand part of the equation. An expletive-spattered prologue fills us in on how the Obamacare act’s obligation for healthcare-providers to cover drug-abuse treatment created a market for recovery facilities worth $12bn a year in southern California alone. Swab then zeroes in on pasty Ohio junkie Utah (Jack Kilmer), plucked from heroin deadendsville and offered free rehab on the west coast by Wood (Michael Kenneth Williams), a broker acting on behalf of treatment centres to find addicts whose stay will be funded by insurance companies. After completing the programme, Utah graduates to becoming an apprentice to Wood and quickly realises the size of the fraud at hand. Wood hauls in patients at scale by offering them a cut of the insurance money; the system has no incentive to see them permanently recover because relapsing addicts mean repeat business. Wood also runs the same ploy on subcutaneous implants that inhibit opiate addiction, delivering a stream of punters worth $60,000 each to a local surgeon. The cynicism and human collateral of it all makes it the narco-industrial complex’s version of sub-prime. Emblazoned with mouthy Big Short-style info-dumps, and with a phone-selling scene reminiscent of The Wolf of Wall Street, Body Brokers outwardly seems to be aiming for high Scorsesian amoral operatics. But given the originality of Swab’s take, it’s a shame he couldn’t find the film a more appropriate style: at heart it is a more sober film intent on declaring its outrage. Kilmer, son of actors Val and Joanne Whalley, is a little bland in the ingenue role, not really digging into the sense that something malignant squirms beneath: not just substance dependency but also American addiction to capitalism – as hinted at by two uses of Public Image Ltd’s Rise on the soundtrack, with its cry that “anger is an energy”. But the Mephistophelean Wood is a great role for Williams; another man running game on the system, like his Omar from The Wire, but the moral compass long since pawned off. • Released on 8 March on digital platforms.	416
This clever thriller teeters on the brink of abstraction, and walks a razor wire between horror and an incredulous absurdity meant to stand for how women must live in the modern world: the daily toll of living in fear of aggression, physical assault and withstanding the misogynistic structures that excuse them. At 2.29am one night, writer May (Brea Grant) peers over her balustrade to see an interloper, features blurred by a gel mask, staring up at her from the backyard. When she retreats to bed to tell husband Ted, he is disturbingly blase: “Honey, that’s the man. The man that comes every night and tries to kill us.” Ted manages to off the housebreaker with a pool cue, but his body disappears within seconds. The next night, and the next, May must do it all over again. As this Groundhog Day home invasion unspools, other characters display the same weird acceptance as Ted. More than the physical threat, it’s as if a new unfathomable reality is creeping in and violating her own. The police response is half-hearted and, adding to the conspiratorial air, Ted packs his bags after an argument: “I can’t change this. This is just how things are.” After these microaggressions, the next macro one is incoming; you might expect an It Follows-style air of inexorable dread to set in, but May remains upbeat. Grant also wrote the script as well as starring, and perhaps it’s this closeness to the core ideas that allows her to pivot spryly between romcom perkiness and a nauseated hesitancy that suggests the dislocation between normal life and its violent substrate. Towards the end, there’s a suggestion that May’s public tough-it-out credo – she is plugging a self-help book called Go It Alone – may be, in some sense, perpetuating these attacks. Possibly this is acknowledging that the strong-woman ideal championed by some quarters of the #MeToo movement comes at the expense of a more realistic and collaborative feminism. Natasha Kermani’s film is an elliptical but vehement statement on the post-#MeToo landscape. If the film’s story development is stymied by the narrative’s ultimate stasis, it is to all the better point out that the fight is far from finished. • Released on 4 March on Shudder.	440
As outrage swirled over the Hollywood Foreign Press Association’s perceived lack of inclusivity, and its mostly virtual Golden Globes ceremony dogged by technical issues, the opening salvo in the pandemic-affected awards season also signalled that Hollywood’s mood is underscored with a sense of grief. The late actor Chadwick Boseman posthumously won the best actor (drama) prize for his role as trumpeter Levee Green in 1920s-set drama Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom. His widow, Taylor Simone Ledward, accepted the award on his behalf, saying in an emotional speech: “He would say something beautiful, something inspiring, something that would amplify that little voice inside of all of us that tells you can, that tells you to keep going, that calls you back to what you are meant to be doing in this moment in history.” Boseman died in August 2020, but completed Ma Rainey and the Spike Lee-directed war film Da 5 Bloods despite a diagnosis of terminal colon cancer. The incongruity of holding a glitzy ceremony only days after the US recorded a Covid-related death toll of 500,000 was not lost on the ceremony’s participants. While her film Nomadland revolved around the devastation caused by another national crisis – the financial crash of 2008 – Chloé Zhao – who won best director as well as best drama film – related it to the prevailing mood in her acceptance speech for best film. She said: “Nomadland, at its core, for me is a pilgrimage through grief and healing. So for everyone who has gone through this difficult and beautiful journey at some point in their lives, this is for you. We don’t say goodbye, we say, ‘See you down the road.’” The difficulties caused by lockdown also were on the Globes’ collective mind, with actor Josh O’ Connor, who won best actor in a TV series (drama) for The Crown, referring to its effect in his acceptance speech, saying: “I am very lucky to work in this period. and there’s so many people who are unable to work and are alone and isolated.” He added: “I hope we can all collectively put mental health at the forefronts of our minds.” Two of the entertainment industry’s most high-profile political activists also made their case. The Hollywood Foreign Press Association has made a donation to Sean Penn’s non-profit relief organisation Core (Community Organized Relief Effort), originally founded in 2010 to help with the aftermath of the earthquake in Haiti and now playing a prominent role in Covid testing and vaccination. Penn reminded the Globes audience (and Hollywood) of ongoing activity to combat the pandemic, and asked for donations. Meanwhile, Mark Ruffalo, a winner on the night as best actor in a limited TV series for I Know This Much Is True, suggested that seeing the back of Donald Trump could only be a good thing: “What connects us is greater than what keeps us apart, and the more we include each other, and see each other, and hear each other, the faster we’ll heal our broken hearts and minds.” But Ruffalo also referred to a crisis that is likely to be with us even when the coronavirus is a memory: “We have a dying mother … she’s Mother Earth. We must come to balance with her, and honour her, and she’ll heal, too.” A sombre start to the awards season.	651
Perhaps posthumous legacy was always on the mind of late rapper Christopher “Notorious BIG” Wallace. His impactful debut album Ready to Die was followed by Life After Death, released 16 days after he was killed aged 24, in a still-unsolved, drive-by shooting. Yet while there have been several filmic attempts to capture this legascy –– including Nick Broomfield’s 2002 documentary Biggie &amp; Tupac and the 2009 biopic Notorious –– this Netflix release is the first to successfully sidestep the quicksand of murder mystery, and focus instead on what Wallace accomplished in life. Clearly redressing that balance was the motivation of at least two executive producers, including Wallace’s label boss and friend, Sean “Diddy” Combs, who early on declares: “This story doesn’t have to have a tragic ending.” It’s the contribution of Wallace’s mother, though, that’s particularly significant. Firstly in the form of family photos and stories illustrating a childhood spent between their Brooklyn neighbourhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant and her family’s home in Trelawny, Jamaica. There, young Wallace’s favourite uncle exposed him to sound system culture, while back in Brooklyn a jazz musician neighbour played him Max Roach and Clifford Brown. So that by the time a 17-year-old Biggie triumphed in the now-legendary rap battle on Bedford and Quincy, he was already “rhyming in a way that exudes all the finer qualities of a bebop drum solo”. More subtly though, Ms Wallace’s involvement gives permission for loyal associates to open up about the “gangster” part of “gangster rapper”. The darkest rumours are omitted, but there’s a detailed account of how Biggie came to dominate the local crack cocaine economy. These mid-90s, north-west Brooklyn specificities are fascinating and relevant; to Biggie’s art, certainly, but possibly also to his death. • Released on 1 March on Netflix.	360
Best dog: Ziggy, Jodie Foster’s relaxed terrier cross Sporting a neck-tie that matched his owner’s silk pyjamas, Ziggy snuggled between Foster and wife Alexandra Hedison and added extra warmth to an authentically spontaneous acceptance speech (best supporting actress for The Mauritanian). The scene was a comforting domestic sequel to Foster’s legendary coming-out speech at the Globes just eight years ago. Runners-up: Cornbread, Regina King’s napping Alsatian-mix, and Sarah Paulson’s chihuahua/wirehaired dachshund/rat terrier mix, Winnie. Best child: Lee Isaac Chung’s seven-year-old daughter “I prayed! I prayed! I prayed!” exclaimed the Minari director’s child when her father’s win – for best foreign language film – was announced. She then leapt into his lap and remained there, hugging and kissing him, for the duration of his speech. “She’s the reason I made this film,” said Chung. “Minari is about a family – it’s a family trying to learn how to speak a language of their own. It goes deeper than any American language, and any foreign language. It’s a language of the heart. I’m trying to learn it myself and pass it on, and I hope we’ll all learn how to speak this language of love to each other, especially this year.” Runners-up: Mark Ruffalo’s children, Keen and Odette; Jason Bateman’s daughters, Francesca and Maple, and Kate Hudson’s children, Ryder, Bingham and Rani. Best speech: Jason Sudeikis Some have suggested a worst-faith reading to Sudeikis’s whacked-out, red-rimmed and flatly rambling acceptance speech, initially punctuated by expletives from an unknown friend in his hotel room. Were drugs or drink involved? If so, might this be a necessity given that Sudeikis was shooting Ted Lasso in London, where awards ceremonies unfold from 1-4am? Another mitigating factor: his tie-dye hoodie was made by his sister and contains 5% recycled bottles. Here, anyway, is his speech in full: That’s nuts. Thank you to the Hollywood Foreign Press. This is, for me, the coolest thing that a group of, you know, like, that’s nuts…. Especially… that’s crazy. OK, umm. Alright. Wow. Here’s what I’ll say. I’ll say this. I want to thank everybody that works on the show. I read this book to my son Otis called The Three Questions by Leo Tolstoy. He has these three questions, like, ‘When’s the best time to do things?’ ‘What is the right thing to do?’ And then, ‘Who is the most important one?’ That last question, ‘Who is the most important one,’ is like, whoever the person you’re with. So I kinda reject the premise of being the best actor, because in my humble opinion the best actor is the person you’re acting with. I want to give this as a shout-out to all the people I act with on the show, because they’re incredible. Do they make me the best? No. But they make me better. Better than I am, better than I thought I could be. Better than anything I can do. I appreciate everyone looking out and Don [Cheadle, a fellow nominee, making ‘wind-up’ motions over Zoom] is right, I gotta wrap this puppy up. Never been my forte. A little windy, little windy, as my Aunt Loretta would say. Best-dressed winner: Chloé Zhao Nomadland’s Zhao became the first Asian woman and only the second woman (since Barbra Streisand back in 1983) to win the Globe for best director. Plaits, a khaki T-shirt and a big view of a radiator kept the focus firmly on the important stuff. Best personal drinking game participant: David Fincher Mank, along with Promising Young Woman, was one of the awards frontrunners which ended the evening without a single win. The director of the former, David Fincher, was seen knocking back a shot of – presumably – vodka when Aaron Sorkin was named best screenwriter for The Trial of the Chicago 7; a gesture many interpreted as Fincher raising a toast to his late father, Jack, who wrote Mank. But when Fincher repeated the swig when he lost best director, a new theory was born. Fingers crossed that if the Oscars are also virtual, winners and losers alike are encouraged to plunder their fridges.	872
The Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which decides on the Golden Globes, had this year been in trouble – as so often before – for its rackety and questionable procedures: this time for the #GlobesSoWhite makeup of its voting constituency. (Presenter Ricky Gervais had last year joked that it was just “very, very racist”.) And yet, with the arguable exception of the snub to Michaela Coel in the TV category, the Globes’ awards this year have not been obviously different from high-minded critics’ choices and there has been diversity: from the spectacular triumph for Chloé Zhao’s docu-fiction Nomadland getting both best director and best film (drama), to Chadwick Boseman’s posthumous award for best actor (drama) for his brilliant, livewire performance as the troubled jazz trumpeter Levee in Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom. There was also resounding success for Sacha Baron Cohen’s Borat Subsequent Moviefilm, getting best film (musical or comedy) and best actor (musical or comedy), for Cohen himself as the egregious Borat. Daniel Kaluuya was best supporting actor for his portrayal of Black Panther Party leader Fred Hampton in Judas and the Black Messiah, and Andra Day was best actress (drama) for her performance as Billie Holiday in The United States vs Billie Holiday. Two of the year’s very best films are on the list, too: Pixar’s wonderful movie Soul from directors Pete Docter and Kemp Powers won best animation (though it should have got a best film nomination, too) and Lee Isaac Chung’s Minari was best foreign film, about a Korean family trying to start a farm in the 1980s Reagan heartland. That, too, should have been brought more centrally into the fold, although it is great to see it rewarded. Nomadland is now set fair to be the blue-chip awards choice, and no one could accuse the Globes of making a bland or middlebrow decision. It is an inspired and very original movie, boldly reaching towards and attaining the status of artwork while unashamedly questioning the nature of the American soul. Zhao brilliantly folds non-professionals into an imagined story built around the cheerful, resourceful, unassuming woman superbly played by Frances McDormand (who is perhaps entitled to feel disappointed that she didn’t win anything). She is one of the new “nomads” identified by the film: formerly prosperous retirees pauperised by the 2008 crash, who are forced to sell their possessions and go on the road in their minivans and RVs, getting seasonal work in places like Amazon fulfilment centres, and finding, for all the pain and hardship, that there is a kind of freedom. It is a fascinating essay in state-of-the-nation cinema. Elsewhere, it was fun to see the triumph for Borat: I had wrongly tipped Hamilton but Borat probably deserves it, purely and simply for its devastating prank on Donald Trump’s bizarre attorney Rudolph Giuliani – the tipping-point for the unravelling of Trump’s campaign. There was history there, too: what a staggering comedown for the former hero of 9/11. Andra Day gave a heartfelt and stirring performance as Billie Holiday in what I feel is a seriously flawed film but – importantly – her rendition of the songs, especially Strange Fruit, was tremendous, although I myself had been plumping for the glorious performance from Viola Davis as the blues singer Gertrude “Ma” Rainey in Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, playing opposite Boseman. Daniel Kaluuya’s Golden Globe for his performance as Fred Hampton is thoroughly deserved, although it is surely misleading to describe a performance with such above-the-title charisma as “supporting”. Rosamund Pike thoroughly deserves her Globe for her performance as the sinister Marla in I Care a Lot, who conspires with crooked doctors and gullible judges to get rich old people imprisoned in care homes on fake dementia diagnoses so she can drain their bank accounts for her “guardianship” fees. This is a thrillingly nasty, gloriously unsympathetic and unrelatable performance. Meanwhile it is satisfying in some sense to see any award go to a performer as strong as Jodie Foster, although there wasn’t much to write home about, in my view, in her appearance as the good-guy liberal lawyer in the fence-sitting, Sorkinesque Guantánamo drama The Mauritanian. Having said which, I found the actual Aaron Sorkin’s Globe-winning screenplay for The Trial of the Chicago 7 displayed his weaknesses, not his strengths: finger-wagging liberal self-congratulation for being on the right side of history. But this has been Chloé Zhao’s night – and I think she will go on to rule the rest of the awards season.	873

Scottish painter James Morrison died shortly before the completion of this affectionate documentary about his life and work which premiered at the Glasgow film festival, and it’s a fitting tribute to an articulate and self-effacing artist with an extraordinary affinity for Scotland’s everchanging land- and seascapes. It’s directed by Anthony Baxter, best known for highlighting the stubborn local resistance to Donald Trump’s golf course in Aberdeenshire with his You’ve Been Trumped films; this is something of a change of pace, while offering a not-dissimilar celebration of a very Scottish style of quiet, unfussy determination. Morrison’s story is interesting enough – born and raised in Glasgow, the son of ship’s fitter, who settled on the east coast and made epic trips to paint abroad, most notably to the Arctic – but it’s added to here by a plangent late-life twist: he is losing his sight, to the extent he can barely see what he is painting. True to form, Morrison accepted this as uncomplainingly as anything else – “irritating” is the strongest imprecation I can recall – and there’s something inexpressibly moving about the way he strokes a blank sheet of paper taped to his easel as if he can’t wait to get started. This is by no means an emotionless film, however: Morrison talks passionately about his wife, Dorothy, who died in 2015, and introduces us to a stormily epic landscape painting he calls “a portrait of grief”. In fact, all of Morrison’s work appears suffused with a kind of religious awe at his surroundings; Baxter artfully inserts beautiful drone shots of big skies, beetling cliffs and rolling hills as an echo of Morrison’s canvases. His Arctic sequence – huge chunks of ice, floating in intense dark blue seas – stands out in terms of spectacle, but Morrison preferred to talk in terms of his own “argument with himself”. As a painter, Morrison ought to be better known; this film should give his reputation and legacy a major uplift. • Released on 5 March in virtual cinemas and digital platforms.	402
Long after Lars von Trier’s Dogme 95 movement has been forgotten, with its tongue-in-cheek commitment to radically low-budget realist cinema, one director is still succeeding in releasing features that are cheaper than student films, composed of people simply talking to each other: in apartments, in restaurants over a lot of alcohol and in the streets with non-actors heedlessly walking past in the background. That director is the South Korean director Hong Sang-soo, who opens this online Berlin film festival with another intriguing and sympathetic vignette: enigmatically entitled Introduction, running at just 66 minutes, despite containing enough backstory detail for a two-hour drama. I’m not sure it is entirely successful, but it demonstrates Hong’s delicate touch in creating films that, like a certain type of short story or poem, suggest more depth and detail than is apparent on the surface. So why is it called Introduction? Some characters are introduced to each other, in different scenes – from different generations, with the polite unease and formality that this entails – and in other scenes, characters are introduced to new ideas and emotions. There is a strange scene in which the lead character appears to introduce himself to his girlfriend for the first time, on a chilly beach, despite their intimacy having been already established in previous scenes, leaving us to wonder, if only for a moment, if it is a flashback or a dream he is having, or if both are a dream someone else is having. The film flits with a dreamlike lightness from country to country, from South Korea to Germany, and back again. Young-ho (Shin Seok-ho) is a pleasant-looking man whom we see at first visiting his father (Kim Young-ho) at his treatment centre in Seoul. His father is an acupuncturist who is, at this very moment, politely tending to a famous actor (Ki Joo-bong), who we later learn has befriended and had an affair with Young-ho’s mother (Cho Yun-hee), and is perhaps the cause of his parents’ marriage breakdown. Young-ho’s relationship with his father is strained and the older man is going through a spiritual crisis. Meanwhile, Young-ho’s shy, almost childlike girlfriend, Ju-won (Park Mi-so), goes to Berlin to study fashion, staying in the apartment belonging to a stylish and beautiful artist (Kim Min-hee, Hong’s partner and frequent collaborator); she is a friend of Ju-won’s mother (Seo Young-hwa), who is astonished and deeply disapproving of the way her relationship is developing with the boyfriend she thought was safely left behind in South Korea. Later, we will see Young-ho have an uneasy encounter with the actor, in the company of his own mother, at which he discusses the vocational crisis with his chosen career of acting – an ambition that has apparently been inspired by an earlier meeting with this man. Introduction, like so many of Hong’s films, occupies a delicate middle ground between whimsy and poetry, between inconsequentiality and epiphany, between lightweight and light. My feeling is that Introduction is closer to the former in each case, and I wanted to hear more about and more from Young-ho’s troubled father. But there is an unmistakable and mature film-making language on display: a simplicity and charm.	622
This plodding crime thriller came out in the US in 2018 but now is its chance to dazzle the UK with its dullness, straight-to-digital lost heist-money shenanigans and easy-to-see-coming plot twists. The whole thing is really waxy and sad, like the immobile face of co-star Sylvester Stallone; although the chance to enjoy the always interesting, never-as-big-as-he-should-have-been Matthew Modine, still looking pretty fly with a shock of white-and-gold hair, is very welcome. An opening blam-blam shootout establishes the stakes and premise: a gang of criminals and inside men plotted and pulled off a bank heist, only to get ambushed in the woods. The multimillion-dollar haul was never found, and the only survivor was Donovan MacDonald (Modine). Unfortunately, a head wound left him with profound retrograde amnesia, and he spends another seven years in a medical penitentiary not even able to remember the crime he’s accused of or, more importantly, where the money is. But nurse Erin (Meadow Williams), fellow inmate Lucas (Ryan Guzman) and shady security guard Farren (Tyler Jon Olson) bust him out of prison and administer an experimental drug that might help him recover his memory if it doesn’t kill him first. Meanwhile, Stallone plays a local cop who has been making one of those mood boards with mugshots and strings wound between push pins for years, and is now being compelled to work with an FBI agent (Christopher McDonald, always a hoot) with a dodgy moustache. The lawmen get far less air time than Modine and Co, which is a blessing really. Shot in Georgia, a popular filming location, and here playing itself for a change, the whole dreary thing looks as if it was put through an Instagram filter called Rotgut that makes everything look like it was soaked in weak coffee and bile. Somehow it fits the depressed, post-industrial mood that the climax takes place in an abandoned concrete factory. • Available from 5 March on Amazon Prime Video.	370
Brothers Colin and James Krisel and/or actor Zach Avery must be either very well financed or ridiculously persuasive because they’ve managed to pull together a supporting cast and budget for this debut thriller that far exceeds what the script seems to warrant. At heart, Last Moment of Clarity is a slight, imaginatively thin B-movie which doesn’t so much as allude to Alfred Hitchcock’s Rear Window and Vertigo as outright steal from them brazenly, ending up with a limp neo-noir that unfolds in the streets of Paris and classy apartments in Los Angeles. There are cameos from Brian Cox and Udo Kier, both great scene-stealing actors with many virtues other than accent mimicry, judging by the bizarre Scots-French mashup Cox tries out here that is only a hair’s breadth better than Kier’s eastern European-German gangster stylings. In any case, each of them appears only fleetingly; the bulk of the running time features Avery as a schlubby guy from New York named Sam who is hiding out in Paris. Sam mooches about the streets and works for bar owner Cox, all the while mourning the loss of his girlfriend, Georgia (Samara Weaving), who died at the hands of some lesser gangsters who work for Kier’s character, for reasons only gradually revealed. When he sees an actor named Lauren in a movie who looks just like Georgia, he becomes convinced that the two women are one and the same, and flies to La La Land to find out. Enter Kat, played by the mesmeric Carly Chaikin, who ends up palling up with Sam, giving Chaikin a chance to play another variation on the manic pixie dream girl type she played in Mr Robot. The script is full of such daft coincidences you keep expecting there will be a clever twist to explain – but no, it really is that lazily written. At least the cinematography (by Andrew Wheeler) has atmosphere and the Parisian shots are pretty. • Available from 8 March on digital formats.	374
To add to the difficulties besetting the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), early TV ratings for its Sunday-night Golden Globes awards show have dropped catastrophically from previous levels. They are likely to become the lowest since the show returned to NBC in 1996. Ratings agency Nielsen’s early “fast national” figures reveal that the show was 60% down on last year’s edition, drawing around 5.4 million viewers in the 18-49 age group, compared to 14.8 million for a similar estimate last year. The final total is likely to rise – the 2020 ratings ended at 18.5 million after all data was collected – but the 2021 total is set to fall well below the 14.7 million recorded in 2009. The poor audience figures underscore problems the HFPA are facing, having signed an agreement with NBC in 2018 that earns the organisation around $60m per year for eight years. Coronavirus restrictions forced the show into a virtual format, as well as a shift from its traditional January slot, depriving it of strong lead-in shows such as NFL games that helped boost its figures. The delays affecting the wider film industry also meant that the kind of commercial star-driven films that boost audience numbers were largely absent from this year’s ceremony. More seriously, the stream of criticism aimed at the HFPA for its perceived lack of diversity and ethical lapses, as well as its underwhelming response to complaints, could have long-term implications for the Globes’ credibility. A recent report in the LA Times suggested that the HFPA was unwilling to reform its membership policy for financial reasons. Tina Tchen, CEO of campaign group Time’s Up, criticised the HFPA for offering a “cosmetic” solution. Hosted by Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, the show resulted in big wins for Nomadland and its director Chloé Zhao, as well as The Crown, which took home four awards in the TV section.	356
Remember all-consuming crushes and awkward first dates? For young people in this age of self-isolation, such tender encounters might well be from another century. Chronicling a young lesbian romance set in a wintry Brighton, Justine is the remedy to the lack of such human contact. But it’s not all coffee dates and beach cuddles: this film is also a window on the harrowing cycle of addiction among displaced young adults. Justine (Tallulah Haddon), on probation and cut off from her family, is in a state of disarray. Awakened by loud bangs from the door – her landlord is asking for this month’s rent – Justine staggers dazedly, and fully clothed, out of the bath. Her lips bear a nasty cut, and her left arm is covered in swathes of white bandages. This dire scene opens to a more hopeful past, only three months earlier, when Justine first locks eyes with Rachel (Sophie Reid), a teacher-to-be, in a bookstore. Harsh financial realities immediately undercut the sweetness of this meet-cute. Rachel gasps as Justine slyly pockets a copy of Ovid’s Heroides. Despite their differing backgrounds, the two women quickly fall in love. The chemistry between Haddon and Reid, as well as their characters’ budding romance, makes Justine special and moving. With all the current industry talk about unnecessary sex scenes, the couple’s first night together has an awkward charm. It’s rare that a film captures so acutely the strange yet exhilarating feelings of two foreign bodies learning to adapt to each other, plus the difficulty of quickly disrobing your new lover of their jeans. In contrast, though, Justine’s descent into alcohol-fuelled self-destruction is handled somewhat less impressively, over-reliant on a series of sombre-sounding songs on the soundtrack. It’s a manipulative and hollow tactic that does a disservice to Haddon’s committed acting. Despite these heavy-handed moments, Justine remains a poignant study of a young woman struggling to stay afloat. • Released on 5 March on digital platforms.	384
There’s been a predictable laze to much of Disney’s animated output in recent years, a staid reliance on the easy mass market appeal of the sequel. Finding Dory, Cars 3, Incredibles 2, Toy Story 4, Ralph Breaks the Internet, Frozen II: a production line of “more of the same” regurgitations that have made the few originals in the same period – Coco, Soul, Moana – feel that much greater in comparison. With the same studio also churning out Marvel and Star Wars follow-ups, prequels and adaptations at breathless pace, it’s made Disney feel more like a cold capitalist corporation than ever before. The release of Raya and the Last Dragon is in no way going to reshape that broader view (Disney is after all a cold capitalist corporation) but it does serve as a reminder of the studio doing what it does best: transporting us to a beautifully crafted universe to tell a story that’s both involving and, vitally, fresh. It’s another victim of the pandemic, premiering in cinemas where possible but also on Disney+ with a lofty $30 price tag, a shame given the film’s lush visuals as well as its ability to prove that yet again, duh, diversity sells as its box office would have surely been substantial with enthused word of mouth propelling it long past opening weekend. It’s the story of Raya (Kelly Marie Tran), a young girl who lives in the fragmented world of Kumandra, split into different warring clans after the evil Druun led to the sacrifice of the dragons they had all once lived peacefully alongside. After an attempt at peace ends in tragedy, years later as a teen, Raya finds herself on a dangerous quest to bring everyone together with the help of the last dragon Sisu (Awkwafina). Set in a fictionalised version of south-east Asia, the accompanying voice cast is made up almost entirely of actors of Asian descent (from Sandra Oh to Gemma Chan to Daniel Dae Kim) although there was some understandable frustration recently when people discovered that the actors are predominantly of east Asian heritage, a sign that for some at Disney, Asia is all the same. It’s an unfortunate misstep in what is otherwise another much-needed attempt at progress not just with its diverse cast and characters but also its positioning of a female lead. Raya is not only the driving force behind the action-led plot but she’s also without a love interest, focused on her family, her mission and her burgeoning friendship with Sisu. Tran’s steeliness is well-matched with Awkwafina’s brand of goofy comedy (she’s so well-suited to voice work that it makes sense she’ll be voicing a seagull in Disney’s upcoming Little Mermaid) and their buddy comedy back-and-forth is funny without bordering on the “this one’s for the adults” smugness that can often seep into post-Shrek animation. It’s a stunningly intricate and immersive world and as Raya travels from clan to clan, directors Don Hall and Carlos López Estrada create unpredictable new elements for her to encounter, making it one of the most visually escapist Disney films for a good while. The design of the Druun is particularly effective, a horrifyingly undefined maelstrom of chaos, turning everything into stone, although I’d argue that the design of the dragons feels a little cheap in comparison to everything else, with Sisu looking a little too My Little Pony-adjacent to feel part of the awe-inspiring world around her. The script, from the Crazy Rich Asians screenwriter Adele Lim and playwright Qui Nguyen, like many Disney films, aims to offer some simple life lessons along with the adventure, urging unity over division and hope over fear, an interestingly timed plea as the US leaves the darkness of one presidency and aims to repair the wounds it’s deepened. Lim and Nguyen manage to infuse this message without it ever feeling preachy, in the same way that Inside Out could be used as a way of explaining mental health or Coco for death to a young viewer, there’s similar, if less potent, worth here with its view of politics. That might sound on paper a little too earnest but it’s handled with a light touch. As with any form of quest narrative, there’s a familiar formula at play and as with any, especially latter-day, Disney animation, there’s a lurch toward the heartstrings in the finale. While some of the beats might be a little too predictable and while the emotional wallop at the end might be more of a gentle tap, Raya and the Last Dragon works for the most part, a charming, sweet-natured YA-leaning adventure that acts as proof that Disney needs to focus on moving forward rather than continuing to look back. Raya and the Last Dragon is released in some cinemas and on Disney+ on 5 March	925
Xavier Beauvois is the actor-turned-director whose Of Gods and Men in 2010 is one of the great French movies of the 21st century; he also has the honour of a cameo, as himself, in the final series of the Netflix comedy Call My Agent. His new film is really intriguing, a film deeply rooted in a close-knit community, with excellent performances, a sophisticated control of narrative tempo and – at least initially – a tragic force that could almost be compared with Elia Kazan. Yet I have to say that this power is dissipated by a disappointing ending in which the film, as its English title warns us, drifts away. Jérémie Renier plays Laurent, a small-town cop in Normandy in northern France, devoted to his partner, Marie, played by Marie-Julie Maille – Beauvois’s own partner and also as often with his work, the film’s editor and co-writer. Together, Beauvois and Maille control of the film’s shape, particularly in the beginning, with its scene-by-scene exposition of the local community. Laurent is also a devoted dad to his infant daughter, Poulette, played by Madeleine Beauvois. Their happy family is made even more blissful when Laurent asks Marie to marry him. At work, Laurent has great colleagues who always have his back: Quentin (Victor Belmondo) and Carole (Iris Bry). He is an excellent officer, dedicated to the local community, to whom we are expertly and indirectly introduced, and at first a certain farmer doesn’t seem necessarily more important than anyone else: this is Julien (Geoffrey Sery), morose and angry, confiding in Laurent about his money worries, overwork and the cripplingly expensive new demands made of him by the hygiene inspectors, the DDPP (or Departmental Directorate of Population Protection). But Julien emerges as someone more and more worrying. Aggressive and despairing, he attacks an inspector and drives off with his shotgun. Finally, Laurent confronts Julien in his farmyard: Julien appears to turn his gun on himself. Laurent draws his own sidearm. Can he perhaps immobilise Julien with a well-aimed non-fatal shot before he kills himself? But wait – does Julien, in fact, intend to kill himself? In the heat of the moment, a terrible misjudgement is made. One of the film’s most extraordinary and shocking, if perhaps slightly contrived scenes comes at the beginning: a couple are having wedding photographs taken on the picturesque beaches when a body lands next to them on the shingle. Beauvois is showing us a bizarre and surreal ill-omen for Laurent personally, as an officer who himself is about to be married and whose destiny intersects with someone who may be about to take his own life. The film is at its very best in simply and unselfconsciously showing the group of people of which Laurent and Marie are a part and also the couple’s contented life. It also does something that is never easy: showing us very happy marital sex. And when the tragedy overtakes Laurent, his interrogation scenes are powerful, as the full seriousness of the situation incises new lines and wrinkles on his face. But then … well, Laurent resolves to make his escape. The sea is calling him, along with a strange and melancholy sense of fatalism. He starts to resemble the notorious real-life British yachtsman Donald Crowhurst, whose life on the ocean wave got so out of control. Where are we going with this? Worryingly, the film takes us away from where it had been so strong: dry land; it is powerful when densely embedded with people and problems. There is no very satisfying resolution to the situation. Yet this doesn’t take away from the dignity and potency of Renier’s performance.	705
The government has extended its £500m insurance scheme protecting film and TV productions in the UK against the cost of Covid shutdowns until the end of the year. Last year, more than £2.8bn was spent on making Hollywood blockbusters and prestige dramas in the UK, from Line of Duty, War of the Worlds and The Witcher to Jurassic World: Dominion, Mission: Impossible 7, Batman and the third instalment of the Fantastic Beasts franchise. The scheme, which was due to end in April, has so far supported more than 200 productions to get back up and running, saving an estimated 24,000 jobs since being launched in October. Despite the support, the total amount spent on film and high-end TV production fell by a fifth last year, as all productions across the UK were forced to close in the early months of the pandemic. However, the introduction of the scheme and industry-wide move to Covid-safe sets fuelled a £1.2bn spending spree in the final quarter of last year, the second highest ever quarterly spend on record, as broadcasters, Hollywood studios and streamers rushed to plug the pandemic gap in fresh content that viewers were facing.	214
Veteran film-maker Anders Refn has had top-billing as a director on a few films that aren’t terribly well known beyond his native Denmark. His reputation is mostly built on his long service as an editor with a very impressive filmography, having cut such films as Breaking the Waves and Antichrist for Lars Von Trier, as well as Sally Potter’s Ginger &amp; Rosa. He also happens to be the father of a more famous film-maker, the flamboyantly talented Nicolas Winding Refn (The Neon Demon, Drive). But judging by Into the Darkness, a historical drama directed and co-written by the elder Refn, father and son couldn’t have more different sensibilities. Not that this second world war-set family saga is at all bad; it’s just very conventional, and feels like it might have been originally conceived as a multi-part drama for television. At its best, the film’s soapy immersion in local history recalls the German epic TV show Heimat. At its worst, it’s a little dry and thumpingly didactic as the various members of the haut-bourgeois Skov family experience the consequences of their moral choices played out as war rages on, even in their relatively quiet corner of occupied Denmark. Patriarch Karl (the great Jesper Christensen) runs a factory that is doing well enough to keep his alcoholic wife, Eva (Bodil Jørgensen), in pretty frocks and nice tableware while their numerous children have pretty much everything they want. But once the Nazis roll into town, the family is fractured along ideological lines, making for some very awkward Christmas Eves. Ne’er-do-well eldest Aksel (Mads Reuther) finds himself more sympathetic to anti-Nazi leftists: at first because of his friendship with the housekeeper’s son (Cyron Melville) and later because he fancies a pretty Bolshevik (Kathrine Thorborg Johansen). Meanwhile, another son (Gustav Dyekjær Giese) joins the Danish army and fights side by side with the Germans, and naive daughter Helene (Sara Viktoria Bjerregaard) is smitten with a dashing German U-boat officer, much to the disgust of her mother. Assorted Jewish friends are carted off and killed, leaving various members of the family questioning their choices. If you have 152 minutes to sink into this morass of moral complexity and finely observed period detail, then it may well be worth it, although the ending is bizarrely, perplexingly abrupt. Perhaps there will be a follow-up feature. • Into the Darkness is released on 5 March on digital platforms.	471
Céline Sciamma’s beautiful fairytale reverie is occasioned by the dual mysteries of memory and the future: simple, elegant and very moving. I fell instantly under its spell, and found myself thinking of classic English tales such as Tom’s Midnight Garden by Philippa Pearce, or The Child in Time by Ian McEwan. And there is an extra-textual pleasure in wondering exactly what its child stars thought about it during filming – and what they think about it now. Joséphine Sanz plays Nelly, the eight-year-old daughter of Marion (Nina Meurisse). The latter is under enormous stress. Marion’s mother has just died in a care home, from long-term complications of a hereditary bone disorder, which Marion herself had to avoid with a painful operation when she was about Nelly’s age. Young Nelly artlessly asks her mum if she can keep her grandmother’s cane, and Marion blankly agrees. Then Marion and her partner (Stéphane Varupenne) take Nelly on a difficult journey to her late mother’s home, where she grew up, and the memories come flooding back – particularly that of a secret hut she built in the woods adjoining the house. Marion is overwhelmed with grief and leaves Nelly alone with her dad. Nelly, being an only child, like her mum, is used to solitude. Her mother’s absence, whether physical or emotional, is something she has had to deal with all her life. Playing in the woods she comes across what appears to be a half-finished hut in a clearing. A girl waves happily to her, asking for help making it. She is the mirror image of Nelly (played by Gabrielle Sanz, evidently Joséphine’s twin sister) and announces that her name is … Marion. After playing together, they go back to Marion’s house, which appears to be an eerie mirror-image of her Nelly’s mother’s childhood home. And there Nelly meets Marion’s kindly, withdrawn, thirtysomething mum, who walks painfully with a cane. It is a ghost story, or a parable, played with realist calm. The girls talk about the future and the past as casually as they would talk about anything else. I found myself holding my breath for long stretches, as the young stars insouciantly saunter in single file along the narrative tightrope. They are left alone on screen for long periods of time, just playing and talking together. “Secrets aren’t always things we try to hide,” says Nelly to her new best friend. “There’s just no one to tell them to.” Their secret is confided to us: the audience. Perhaps Nelly’s mum was as lonely as a child as Nelly is now. Perhaps Nelly has always wanted her mum to be a friend, to speak to her as directly and simply as she would a friend her own age. And perhaps the adult Marion has felt exactly the same thing. I’m not being facetious when I say that this meeting of the two girls reminded me of Marty McFly’s first encounter with his dad in Back to the Future, another brilliant film of a very different type. There is something eternally strange about the simple fact that your parents were once the same age as you, had the same worries and fears and thoughts as you; and crucially, the same inability to see into the future – the future which is you. Making these two characters vulnerable and delicate children is an artistic masterstroke on Sciamma’s part. What a superb movie – a jewel of this year’s Berlin film festival. • Petite Maman screened at the Berlin film festival and is released on 19 November in the UK.	706
Here’s a tale of chest-puffing courage and one-dimensional heroism from Russia during the second world war: an old-fashioned patriotic epic with slo-mo action scenes, intestines spewed on the battlefield and a soppy sentimental romance. It is based on real events in 1941, when more than 3,000 young military cadets were sent to the frontline to defend Moscow. Their mission was to buy time, holding off the Germans for five or six days until reinforcements arrived. Only a third survived. The cadets are still three months from graduating military school when the order comes to mobilise. These lads are future Red Army commanders, the brightest and the best. Two of them, best friends Lavrov (Artyom Gubin) and Shemyakin (Igor Yudin), are in love with the same girl, trainee doctor Masha (Lubov Konstantinova). Good-looking Lavrov is a crack-shot gunner, recklessly brave and romantic. Shemyakin is gentle and decent, a bit dull. You can guess which one Masha kisses in the broom cupboard. All three end up on the frontline, a town 200km from Moscow, as German tanks roll in. The soldiers around them are collection of cliches: there’s the strapping country boy dreaming of his mother’s borscht, and the speccy intellectual who translates when they capture a Nazi; otherwise, the Germans are a faceless horde. “This is not a war, it’s a massacre,” says an army doctor as the bodies pile up. Hopelessly outnumbered, the cadets are shot, burned alive, blown to bits. But director Vadim Shmelyov actually seems a bit squeamish about immersing his audience in the hell, death and chaos of war. He seems more interested in glorifying the cadet’s sacrifice and valour with a clumsy jingoistic script. Take the lad blinded in battle, a bandage wrapped around his head. He’s refusing to go to hospital, professing to the heavens as the music swells: “I still have my hands. I can load machine gun belts.” • Available from 8 March on digital platforms.	389
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind meets Ghost in this relationship indie from Tara Miele about a woman who is killed – or is she? – in a car crash. Sienna Miller is brilliant as gallerist Adrienne, who’s out on a date night (“it’s cheaper than couple’s therapy”) with her partner Matteo (Diego Luna) in Los Angeles. Frazzled and sleep-deprived from parenting their six-month-old Ellie, they’re bickering when their car hits an oncoming SUV. At the hospital, Adrienne has an out-of-body experience, watching as porters cover her bloodied body with a sheet and push the gurney along corridors to the morgue. Next, she steps out of the hospital into scenes of the future without her: Matteo at her funeral, baby Ellie grown into a teenager. Then Miele’s script yanks the rug away. Adrienne is at home, very much alive, a pharmacy of pills on the bedside table. It’s all been a dream. At least, that’s what everyone is telling her; she is concussed, disoriented. But Adrienne is convinced she’s dead. To help her make sense of what’s happening, Matteo suggests they relive the history of their relationship. But each brings their own resentment to the story, so the memory flashbacks change depending on who’s talking. As a couple, were they flawed from the beginning? “It’s so sad we fell apart,” says Adrienne, but actually the love story is the least interesting thing here – it’s a bit generic and insipid. What’s really impressive is how Miele pulls off the tone shift from naturalistic portrait of a couple to psychological drama to moments with just an undertone of horror – in one, Adrienne, checking the cot, sees the baby stiff and lifeless, and becomes hysterical. From the confusion and alarm on Matteo’s face you know that she is hallucinating. It’s clammily claustrophobic. Miller is at the heart of the film; her natural and believable performance touches so many emotions, and makes them all look so real. Adrienne can be funny about her condition. Watching a zombie movie she jokes: “These are my people.” But her terror of being pulled into nothingness is so convincing – which is quite a feat in a film that’s so contrived. • Wander Darkly is released on 8 March on digital platforms.	464
Radu Jude’s new film, with its rambling and self-consciously inelegant title, is an absurdist provocation, or an obsessive-compulsive disruption, like the photograph of the dadaist Benjamin Péret insulting a priest in the street. It’s about the anger and frustration of Romania, and maybe of all of us, at the Covid outbreak, and our creeping suspicion that standard-issue human unhappiness will survive even when, or if, the disease is eradicated. Most of all, this is about porn, and even when it is not about porn, it is somehow still about porn and the porn aesthetic of social media. There is a bleak humour here, but also a kind of redundancy: the film constitutes a huge comedy pratfall that isn’t perhaps every bit as funny and meaningful as it was supposed to be. It is in three parts: in the first, a harassed teacher, Emi (Katia Pascariu), is shown walking through Bucharest doing her shopping and attending to various tasks, with everyone wearing masks, or not quite wearing them, or not wearing them, and everyone is very bad-tempered with each other. Emi herself is particularly stressed: there are calls for her to be sacked from her job because an explicit sex video featuring Emi and her partner has surfaced on the internet, without her permission – and this gonzo-porn video begins the film. In the second part, Jude suspends the conventional narrative to give us a dictionary of terms, in 26 alphabetical sections, covering any number of subjects, ancient and modern, from military tyranny to blowjobs, accompanied by maxims and apothegms from people such as Todorov, Benjamin and Woolf. In the third part, the story of Emi resumes. There is a kangaroo-court show-trial of Emi, taking place outside in a courtyard (evidently because of social distancing rules) in which the parents will vote on whether Emi should be fired. This event becomes a grisly festival of misogyny, racism and hypocrisy. Emi must somehow impress on her shrieking accusers that it is the person who has uploaded the video without her knowledge who is at fault and not her. Confrontations and physical violence erupt and the headteacher plaintively asks for everyone to “maintain social distancing” to which they jeer: “Oh, like she did in the video?” There is a creeping fascination to the cinematography in the opening scene. As poor Emi trudges about, attending to her chores, the camera wanders away from her, filming irrelevant or spurious objects. It appears to be taking stunned notice of all there is around her: torn posters, things thrown away in the streets, ruined buildings. The details suddenly pile up on the screen, as if the camera itself is undergoing a breakdown, suddenly noticing, for the first time, all this meaningless clutter that surrounds all of us, all the time. Like us, it has just about had enough. The static dictionary section is the middle part of the triptych, but it’s also a bizarre interruption that appears to be trying to tell us something: here are all the determinant factors that have led up to Emi’s ordeal, all the forces of history and ideology. And then there is Emi’s bizarre trial itself. The film is a contemptuous slap at boredom, at hypocrisy and at everything petty and mean. I’m not sure that it entirely transcends all these things, but there’s a rebellious spark. • Bad Luck Banging or Loony Porn screened at the Berlin film festival, and is released on 26 November in UK cinemas.	678
In a Paris primary school, a class of eight-year-olds sit behind their desks, eyes squeezed shut, counting to 20. At the back of the room their teacher, Antoinette (Laure Calamy), is getting undressed, slipping into silk frock for the school concert. “It’s not too much?” she asks the pupils. She’s having an affair with one of the dads – he’s married. Thus, with unparalleled Frenchness, begins this easygoing, warm comedy following Antoinette as she accidentally-on-purpose goes on the same donkey-trekking holiday as her lover’s family. As Antoinette bonds with her donkey, the movie evolves from gentle farce to journey of emotional growth. You might call it Eat Bray, Love – except it’s European, so there’s less pseudo-spiritual self-discovery and more drunken snogging. Antoinette is meant to be spending the first week of summer holidays alone with lover Vladimir (Benjamin Lavernhe) while his family are at the beach. Instead, when his wife surprises him with a family hiking holiday, Antoinette impulsively books herself a place, too: six days of 20km hikes, staying in hostels. She arrives in teeny denim hot pants and huge wedge sandals – there’s as much Bridget Jones in her DNA as Julia Roberts. But Vladimir is nowhere to be seen, and, predictably, it’s not love at first sight with her stubborn donkey Patrick either. There are some subtly pointed scenes at the beginning of the trek as a succession of guys mansplain to Antoinette how to manage her donkey. “Show him who’s boss,” says one handing her a whip. Instead, she uses her empathetic teaching style to win the beast over – and Calamy really grounds the movie with her funny, generous performance. The showdown with Vladimir and his wife, when it finally comes, is a lesson in the famous French casualness about infidelity. But Antoinette’s affair slips into insignificance quite quickly; the real chemistry here is with the four-legged ass, not the human one. • Released on 5 March on Curzon Home Cinema.	400
If nothing else, the past 12 Covid-filled months have been full of opportunities for learning. Learning about ourselves, about each other, about our country and the world. I can’t say I’ve embraced every lesson, as it’s also been a year full of opportunities for naps, but I’ve certainly learned a lot about myself. I’ve learned how many times I can watch every episode of Schitt’s Creek before I can recite the entire script verbatim; that I prefer Zoom dance classes because I really can dance like nobody’s watching; and that I can survive for days on yoghurt and coffee alone. The most valuable lessons have been in discovering how many creature comforts I once thought essential that I can live happily without. From takeout to pedicures, spin classes to restaurants, I didn’t cry for much during lockdowns. It’s actually been a welcome crash course in reducing my spending and checking my privilege. What I did miss, other than seeing my friends and the world not being on fire, was going to concerts, plays and, especially, movies. I love going to the movies. I love it a lot. Every time I go I feel like little orphan Annie, and not just because I have curly hair and no parents. I feel like Annie in the scene where the secretary sings “Let’s go to the movies” and all the house staff dance around like they get fair wages because this precocious child they now serve is going to the talkies. But honestly, what’s not to love? Movie theatres are air-conditioned time-vacuums with increasingly comfy seats, where junk food is encouraged and attractive people distract you from your troubles. Even when a movie is bad, I still eat Maltesers and ignore my phone for 90 minutes, so everybody wins. Cinemas have always been my happy place and the setting of many fond memories. My dad taking my sister and me to the Care Bears film; my mum taking us to The Delinquents when we were too young to see The Delinquents; holding hands in the dark with my first boyfriend; and countless midnight sessions of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. I also vaguely recall my local childhood cinema having a live host who would do jokes, sing happy birthday, give out candy and maybe make balloon animals. It’s entirely possible these were fever dreams but, either way, it was a good time. There have been a few bad silver screen incidents over the years, namely being dumped in a car park after Wonder Woman, and an ill-advised screening of Schindler’s List with other Holocaust survivor families. But I don’t blame Hollywood for my poor taste in men or intergenerational trauma, and nor should you. I missed going to the movies. But at least thanks to streaming services – the third Covid-19 MVPs behind frontline workers and Yoga with Adriene – movies themselves are more accessible than ever. And you don’t have to put on pants or shower to watch them. When movie theatres reopened after lockdown in New South Wales last year, I was apprehensive. Though I wanted to support my favourite cinemas and mainline choc tops, it was quite some time before I braved one. But when the virus seemed under control for long enough, I threw caution to the possibly contaminated wind and saw Promising Young Woman with a friend. Being in a cinema was a heady mix of weird and wonderful. Everything seems as it was before but little things make it clear we’re not in Kansas any more. There are demarcated lines going into and out of different areas and social distancing markers all along the floors. The candy bar is a sliver of its former self, with more hand sanitiser than popcorn and, at least at the time, everyone wearing masks. Most devastatingly, for me at least, the pick and mix lolly stations are gone. Sure, the reduced numbers of people allowed in each session make for a more peaceful and comfortable movie-going experience, but how am I supposed to suspend my disbelief without chocolate bullets and gummy cherries? I’m not an animal. (Side note: Go see Promising Young Woman. It’s epic and brilliant and if this was a review I’d be giving it four stars.) Days after this successful trip to the talkies, Sydney’s northern beaches Covid cluster ruined Christmas and we all retreated back into our home-caves. It wasn’t until last week that I braved another big screen to see the excellent movie Incitement, now screening as part of the Jewish International Film Festival. I was nervous, but thankfully no infections have been reported as a result. With all the hardship Covid-19 has wrought, it feels somewhat foolish to celebrate cinema visits. But I think it’s important for everyone right now to do things that make them happy, as long as they’re following the restriction rules and not hurting anyone. So I’ll be going to the movies again and again as long as I can.	968
Did we need a sequel to Eddie Murphy’s fish-out-of-water 1980s romp Coming to America – with the word “to” transformed into a “2”? Will this trigger wacky sequel ideas for Bergman’s Face to Face, or Kurosawa’s To Live? The original movie, directed by John Landis, had Murphy as the discontented Prince Akeem of the fictional African state Zamunda, obedient to his sonorous father the king (James Earl Jones), but yearning for a modern, independent-minded bride. So he travels to Queens, New York with his pal Semmi (whose name doesn’t get the obvious gag despite the nonstop sexual innuendo), played by Arsenio Hall. Posing as students, they encounter various latexed comedy characters – barbers, barbershop customers, etc, played by Murphy and Hall themselves – and Akeem finally finds happiness with Lisa, played by Shari Headley. A TV pilot in 1989 starring In Living Color’s Tommy Davidson was not picked up. This new film, starring Murphy once again (directed by Craig Brewer and scripted by the first film’s credited screenwriters David Sheffield and Barry W Blaustein, with Kenya Barris) finds us in Zamunda, 33 years on, with Akeem and Lisa now a middle-aged prince and princess and the ailing king still on the throne. But having become the father to three daughters, Akeem is mortified to realise that Zamunda’s reactionary constitution will not allow him to make them his heirs. Then comes news that he has a son from a hilarious but until now primly forgotten one-night stand in New York with Mary (Leslie Jones). This unpromising boy Lavelle (Jermaine Fowler), is working as a ticket-scalper for his dodgy uncle Reem (Tracy Morgan). So Akeem and Semmi once again journey to America to find Lavelle (and that barbershop) and awaken him to his glorious Zamundan destiny. It is not clear how much attitudes have changed in Zamunda or indeed the US since 1988. The success of Wakanda in Black Panther means that a made-up African country isn’t regarded as automatically offensive, and its neighbouring state Nextdoria is quite funny. But Zamundan princes are still entitled to be “bathed” by comely young female attendants and indeed to have sex with them (although there are now male attendants for visiting female guests from the US). One such female groomer, Mirembe (Nomzamo Mbatha) is, however, a smart and professional-minded young woman and Lavelle looks like falling for her and not the vapid princess picked out for him. Akeem’s fierce daughters Meeka (KiKi Layne), Omma (Bella Murphy, daughter of Eddie) and Tinashe (Akiley Love) are there to provide the womanpower. But the movie is as tired and middle-aged as Akeem himself; Murphy is oddly waxy and stately, and has no authority figures he can really play off. The film itself has some pre-emptive dialogue between Lavelle and Mirembe on the subject of whether sequels can ever work: Lavelle thinks the Barbershop franchise was successful, and there is some discussion of whether Queen Latifah’s Beauty Shop spinoff counts. There might also be another sly touch of self-reference when we find out that the McDonald’s-ripoff burger joint McDowell’s, which once employed Akeem as a humble floor-mopper in Queens, now has a franchise outlet in Zamunda, but the manager keeps getting copyright lawsuits from McDonald’s. The first film comically positioned Africa as “old-fashioned” and America as “modern” – so the sequel has no clear way to update matters and establish a modern perspective. There is no way to say things have changed, because it’s basically stuck with the same old-fashioned/modern template: Lavelle is slovenly and disrespectful but also has a modernity and vitality that Zamunda supposedly needs – although its quaint old-fashionedness is what supposedly makes it funny, and there is no explicit talk of changing that sexist constitution. Going 2 Africa is an odd journey. • Coming 2 America is released on 5 March on Amazon Prime Video. This article was amended on 5 March to correct errors in the text that were introduced during the production process.	781
In 1979 I flew out to Sicily with the great Ronald Pickup for a long weekend – he to film a cameo as Stravinsky in a glossy biopic about the dancer Nijinsky, I as a film trade paper observer. On the flight, we joked about the potential pitfalls of such biopics, as in: “Hark, I think I hear Dickens writing his latest novel.” Cut to the set at the exquisite Bellini opera house in Catania, where Stravinsky sits at a (dummy) keyboard hammering out his latest composition. As he finishes with a flourish, the impresario Diaghelev (Alan Bates) inquires excitedly of its title. “I call it Le Sacre du Printemps,” Pickup replies portentously, adding a helpful subtitle for potential US audiences: “The Rite of Spring.” At which point I swear that Pickup caught my eye as I sat stifling giggles on the corner of the set.	170
In retrospect, it’s clear why America’s imperial project in Vietnam failed back in the ‘60s: you can’t win a war when your army doesn’t want to fight. In desperate need of soldiers to send into battle, instituting the draft seemed like the only option for the US military, when in actuality this choice was more like their great undoing. Rounding up thousands of men and forcing them to ship out under fear of arrest instead of their own ideological volition created a fractious fighting force at odds with itself, unenthusiastic to resentful to outright insubordinate. A lot of the ordinary guys who weren’t already enlisting against their will soon joined the internal counter-cause after realizing they had been made pawns in a conflict fought over obscure financial imperatives, rather than any pretense of justice. To die face down in a rice paddy defending capitalism just didn’t have the noble luster of upholding all that was right against the dastardly Nazis; Americans understood Vietnam as the country’s first “bad war”, in which the presumed protagonists in the west came to suspect they might be the villains. The FTA Show took shape as the inevitable consequence of this unrest at home and abroad. Led by Jane Fonda and Donald Sutherland with backing from activist folk musicians such as Len Chandler, the anti-USO variety extravaganza channeled the moment’s bitterness and frustration into rollickingly subversive protest-tainment. (The title tune clarifies the four-letter profanity directed at the army.) A little-screened 1972 documentary under the truncated title of FTA followed their tour of active bases from Hawaii to the Philippines to Japan, each performance packed to the rafters with disillusioned GIs eager to hear an alternative to the rah-rah party line of their “jailers”, as Fonda joked. The film spent barely a week in theaters before quietly vanishing from the schedule; director Francine Parker claimed that the distributor, American International Pictures, backed down upon receiving a call directly from the White House. But now, a brand-new 4K restoration has at last received a public release, sounding out a once-elusive call of defiance for all to hear. The ragtag band of hippies, radicals and merry pranksters sought to turn the “political vaudeville” of Bob Hope on its head with satirical songs and skits undercutting the chain of command. Draftees often loathed their order-barking commanding officers, a contempt easily translated into MAD Magazine-styled punch lines. In one comic interstitial, a general asks one of his troops for a quarter, who offers it with an informal “Sure!” The senior-ranking serviceman chews out his underling for the familiarity and asks for the quarter again, this time receiving a hearty “No, sir!” In this instance as in many others, the spirit of disobedience compensates for the rather mild humor, not quite as uproarious as Laugh-In yet 10 times as dangerous. A musical number like Nothing Could Be Finer Than to Be in Indochina! is more bracing than anything else, hollering what many considered unspeakable from the top of the singer’s lungs. Extensive interview segments bolster the boldfaced ideology with testimony from the men on the ground, and on both sides of the conflict. Among the most controversial elements was an introductory title card stating that the film had been produced in cooperation with not just GIs, but also their “friends” whose “lands they presently occupy”. The camera crew had no trouble finding Americans and Japanese united in a wish for the armed forces to vacate Okinawa and leave the island be, or Filipino demonstrators articulating a shared desire with the GIs to get them home. The military seems to alienate its people along every personal line, whether it be race (black soldiers discuss the discrimination they face among their own ranks, and the hypocrisy of fighting for a country that couldn’t care less about them), gender (Fonda’s song I’m Tired of Bastards Fuckin’ Over Me calls out sexism and harassment), or class (volunteers from dirt-poor communities realize that they’re risking their lives to make rich men richer). The scant straight-faced moments – Sutherland reading an excerpt from Dalton Trumbo’s Johnny Got His Gun, Okinawan musicians somberly singing in their native tongue – emphasize that the rabble-rousing show aspired to more than simple provocation. The opposition came from a place of compassion, a stance not of hatred for the soldiers themselves, but for the establishment powers-that-be forcing them to act against their own interest. The film makes sense of a dissonance that compelled conservatives at the time to wonder why “Hanoi Jane” wouldn’t just leave America, if she hated it so much. With 20/20 hindsight, we can see that it was specifically because she and her comrades loved the country that they devoted their energies and risked their reputations to better it, their criticisms the ultimate act of patriotism. FTA is available in virtual cinemas in the US on 5 March with a UK date to be announced	936
Pietro Marcello is the director who recently gave us the much-praised drama Martin Eden, transposing the Jack London novel to Italy. Now he has made this documentary, a labour-of-love tribute to one of Bologna’s most favoured sons: the musician and singer-songwriter Lucio Dalla. It’s probably addressed to Dalla’s existing fanbase, rather than newcomers (which I admit includes me) but this is an engaging study, opening a window into the heart of postwar Italy, and incidentally gives a cameo role to this newspaper. Dalla emerges from the film somewhere between America’s Bob Dylan and Belgium’s Jacques Brel, but otherwise completely in a genre of his own. He was a former cherubic child star who acted, sang and played instruments and grew up to be a somewhat disconcertingly unprepossessing and even ugly man: he cheerfully owned up to the nickname of ragno, or spider, due to his famously hirsute image. (Pictures of him in a swimming costume show someone almost covered in fur.) In his later years of fame and wealth, he actually owned a yacht called Catarro (or Phlegm), due to his habit of coughing and spluttering. But actually, he had a rather humorous and sensitive face, a little like Phil Collins. Dalla had a successful recording career in jazz and pop, but he only became an Italian legend when he teamed up with the Bologna poet Roberto Roversi, who contributed lyrics – a kind of high-minded Bernie Taupin to Dalla’s Elton John – and the pair created complex and daring concept albums, with all kinds of bold commentary on Italian politics and society. A TV clip shows a round-table discussion, featuring politicians and journalists deferring to Dalla. His most notable album was probably Automobili (or Automobiles) from 1976, about Italy’s love affair with cars, and particularly the now defunct endurance road race, the Mille Miglia, which took place annually to wild nationwide excitement from the 1920s to the 1950s. The opening track is a long riff, imagining the bland, pompous and evasive replies given by Fiat boss Gianni Agnelli to a journalist from the Guardian - although Dalla spells it out as the “Manchester Guardian” – about selling a stake in Fiat to Libya, with a possible loss of Italian jobs. What other pop star, anywhere in the world, could have created a song taken from Guardian headlines about the car industry and unemployment? The documentary interviews Dalla’s devoted manager and friend Tobia Righi and uses a good deal of black-and-white archive footage of Bolognese life as that city was transformed into a place of crowded urban modernity. Perhaps it’s more for insiders and specialists, but this film is a taste of Italian life. • Per Lucio screened at the Berlin film festival, and is available on 15 February on Mubi.	535
In writer-director Andrew Cohn’s deceptively modest drama The Last Shift, fast-food worker Stanley (Richard Jenkins) is finally calling it quits. He has worked the graveyard shift at Oscar’s Chicken and Fish for 38 years, but now he’s moving from Michigan to Florida to take care of his elderly mother; grease be gone. He’s proud of his tenure, slickly handling the drunks and the teens who ridicule him, rarely putting a foot wrong. But when he’s forced to train his replacement, the opinionated twentysomething Jevon (Shane Paul McGhie), Stanley starts to reconsider his life’s work and whatever meaning he might have attached to it. Jevon is dismissive of the job, forced into it while on probation after defacing a federal monument, and aiming to return to his love of writing when his circumstances allow. Jevon is smart but difficult, failing his beleaguered girlfriend and young son, unable to knuckle down and provide. It’s a mismatched buddy film, but not entirely unsuccessful thanks largely to Jenkins, who can play a role such as this with his eyes closed, and McGhie who captures a mixture of righteousness and despondency. It sort of ambles along with no great imprint until a sharpish left turn as Cohn tries to transform his small-town drama into something far greater. Talk of race and class clumsily enters the picture – Jevon is black while Stanley is white – with a rushed sequence of events suddenly trying to say something about the American divide. There’s an attempt to humanise bigotry that feels a little uneasy (perhaps surer hands could have tackled this differently), and the shift in focus feels a little underpowered, with a final note that lands with a whimper. • The Last Shift is released on 8 March on digital platforms.	343
Here is a gentle and ruminative, if slightly placid, documentary from director Alastair Cole, about the fishermen of the Western Isles and their way of life catching herring, eels and lobsters. Despite technological advances (and presumably Brexit – though it isn’t mentioned) this world has remained essentially unchanged for a century or more. One shot shows a man unselfconsciously smoking a cigarette as the catch is sifted through, quite as he might have done in 1921. What is notable about this film is that the only spoken language we hear is Scottish Gaelic. What this means, in practice, is that the scenes of the modern fishing industry and the fishing way of life are shown with a soundtrack of audio interviews (in Scottish Gaelic) with fishermen talking about their working lives, dating evidently from the 1940s or 1950s, though the film does not make the provenance of these tapes clear. The effect is to show a particular sort of modernity with the ghosts and the echoes of the past not so very far from the surface. Watching the film, I did wonder if the people we were seeing on screen were actually English speakers – but no, Scottish Gaelic is what they speak as well. That being the case, I would have very much liked to hear from them, speaking directly, about their world. It might have brought this film to life a bit more. And as for the archive audio material, I would have preferred to see historical footage and photography to go with that, although some relevant still images were produced for the closing credits. It’s a sensitive and respectful portrait. • Iorram (Boat Song) is released on 5 March on digital platforms.	323
Documentary film-maker Gianfranco Rosi has created a very characteristic cine-poem of sadness, about the Middle East as it emerges from Isis terror, but remaining scarred by the intervention of western powers who had promised so much. It’s an intensely considered curation of scenes: glimpses, perhaps, into a collective mind or soul. Rosi has assembled this from years of filming in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and the Kurdistan region of northern Iraq. It’s similar in its observational procedures to films such as Sacro GRA, his 2013 study of those who live on the periphery of Rome, near the “GRA” ring road, and also his masterly Fire at Sea from 2016, about the lives of desperate migrants who arrive in Lampedusa, Sicily, and the locals who are coming to terms with them. The title means “night” or “of the night”, and many scenes seem to be happening at nightfall (or possibly at daybreak), particularly the opening, extended sequence of soldiers drilling, jogging around in a circle. There are many striking moments and beautifully realised images and vignettes here, a rhetorical structure that is perhaps inspired by the play that, in one scene, psychiatric patients are shown rehearsing about the lives of people in Iraq. But I worried a little that Rosi’s techniques are becoming a self-conscious mannerism, and furthermore that the film is a little too diffuse, taking in four different places and effectively homogenising them. Of course, in important ways, the film is about what they have in common: the loneliness, the alienation, the survivor-trauma. The film’s most powerful scenes are those that show a therapist working with children who have witnessed or experienced torture at the hands of Isis: they show this in their drawings. The “child’s drawing” has been a cliche in most fiction and non-fiction films, but the ones shown here are all but overwhelming. Later, old black-shawled women troop grimly through a prison where their sons (presumably Kurds) were put to death, and moan desolately that they can feel their dead sons’ spirits in the walls. Again, the image appears to have a visual echo: soldiers on patrol, moving through an apparently deserted house with torches and guns. If not staged exactly, these sequences are ones in which the camera, from its fixed position, must have been prominent in the minds of those being filmed. The people shown are mostly mute: particularly a rather haunting boy, shown hunting on his own and later with his father. The soldiers, too, are mostly silent, enduring the boredom and watchfulness. But perhaps their silence is a filmic artefact, and these people might have a lot to say for themselves in another type of film. It isn’t that Rosi has removed the context, it is more that he has supplied a new context, a more universalised, humanistic context of the spirit – with some artistic licence. But I felt that his earlier films give us a more intimate access to people’s lives than Notturno does, for all its intelligence, empathy and stoicism. • Notturno is released on 5 March on Mubi.	603
The provocative Romanian film Bad Luck Banging or Loony Porn has won the Golden Bear at the Berlin film festival, capping the truncated 2021 virtual edition of the event. Directed by Radu Jude, Bad Luck Banging is a satirical parable about a teacher who is put up before a tribunal after a sex tape is illicitly leaked on to the internet. In a three-star review, Guardian film critic Peter Bradshaw described it as “a contemptuous slap at boredom, at hypocrisy and at everything petty and mean” and said it is about “our creeping suspicion that standard-issue human unhappiness will survive even when, or if, [Covid] is eradicated”. In a statement, the jury –which included directors Gianfranco Rosi and Jasmila Žbanić – said: “It is an elaborated film as well as a wild one, clever and childish, geometrical and vibrant, imprecise in the best way. It attacks the spectator, evokes disagreement, but leaves no one with a safety distance.” The festival’s second prize went to Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy, a three-part drama by the Japanese auteur Ryusuke Hamaguchi. Bradshaw described it as an “ingenious, playful, sparklingly acted and thoroughly entertaining portmanteau” in a four-star review. Before the festival began, considerable attention had been given to Berlin’s decision to make its acting award “gender neutral”. Tilda Swinton had called the idea “eminently sensible” while others suggested there may be a counterproductive effect that female actors find themselves excluded. In the event, Berlin’s first gender-neutral award went to Maren Eggert for her performance in I’m Your Man, directed by Unorthodox’s Maria Schrader, as a woman who reluctantly agrees to go on a “date” with a custom-built robot played by Dan Stevens. Due to coronavirus restrictions, the Berlinale has been split into two parts: the online event – which finishes today and was designed for press and industry delegates – and a public event, due to take place in June.

It’s ironic that Star Wars, perhaps the ultimate tale of good triumphing over evil, has become embroiled in the current culture wars. George Lucas’s original trilogy is as universally adored as Brothers Grimm fairytales, the paintings of Leonardo da Vinci or the songs of the Beatles. Finding out that it is also loved by racists is a bit of a shock. It’s hard to imagine Lucas sitting down in the mid-70s to ponder which far-out, disparate elements to throw into his original Star Wars film in order to concoct that perfect, swirling blend of science fiction and fantasy, because it’s hard to conceive of a time when the early Star Wars films didn’t exist. One thing we can be pretty sure of, however, is that Lucas did not imagine the early movies as standard bearers for Aryan white supremacy, such that attempts to create more multiracial casts for later episodes would be attacked as somehow letting the side down. Yet that is surely the only way we can read the mindset behind the hideous attacks by “alt-right” trolls suffered by the Asian American actor Kelly Marie Tran in 2017, after she was cast in a relatively small role in Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi. Tran, currently winning rave reviews for her voice turn in Disney’s Raya and the Last Dragon, revealed this week that the Last Jedi experience felt as if she “fell in love very publicly and then very publicly had an embarrassingly horrible breakup” in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter. The actor, who felt compelled to quit social media after the attacks, described a “succession of events in which I left the internet for my own sanity”. “If someone doesn’t understand me or my experience, it shouldn’t be my place to have to internalise their misogyny or racism or all of the above,” said Tran. “Maybe they just don’t have the imagination to understand that there are different types of people living in the world.” Why did these extremist trolls feel any ownership over Star Wars? Could it be because of Lucas’s unwieldy approach to race in the prequel films, which were criticised for imagining extra-terrestrials such as Jar Jar Binks, Nute Gunray and Watto according to, variously, Caribbean, east Asian and Jewish ethnic stereotypes? Even the Star Wars creator’s harshest critics usually saw such missteps as wrongheaded attempts to imagine a diverse galaxy. Lucas borrowed successfully from the samurai films of Akira Kurosawa for his first trilogy, a move that these days might be seen as cultural appropriation, and his Imperial stormtroopers clearly recall the Nazi Sturmabteilung – not a problem, he made them the bad guys. But perhaps the film-maker’s hamfisted attempts to broaden the cultural mix for the prequels accidentally ended up warming the cockles for modern-day Nazi Star Wars fans, a development few saw coming but a sign of how deeply problematic such blunders can be. That the sequel trilogy tried to offer up a view of the galaxy as a diverse place with the casting of Tran and John Boyega, among other actors, is surely to its credit (even if Boyega has spoken publicly about the way he felt the series’ actors of colour were ultimately sidelined). It does seem bizarre that certain so-called fans balk at the prospect of seeing black men or Asian women flying the new movies’ X-wings, but have no issue at all with syntactically challenged, green-skinned, giant-eared Jedi homunculi or oversized dog-faced teddy bear sidekicks. Perhaps Mark Hamill’s Luke Skywalker was himself the problem. Maybe generations of racists grew up on the idea of the ultimate hero being a white-skinned, blue-eyed kid with shiny blond hair, so that the idea of anyone of different ethnicity stepping to the fore felt like a personal insult. But there has always been more to Luke than meets the eye. There’s just no way you can be poster-boy for white supremacy when your dad is really James Earl Jones.	754
As cinemas in the US start to reopen, distributors and exhibitors are hoping to coax audiences back in front of screens with promises of enhanced safety, unmissable movies – and a personal welcome from the stars. Liam Neeson will personally greet cinemagoers who go and see his latest action thriller, The Marksman, at the AMC Lincoln Square in New York’s Upper West Side before screenings on Friday. “This is one for the diary,” Neeson told the Hollywood Reporter earlier this week. “It will be nice to welcome people. I think going to the cinema is a bit of a sacred experience. I’ve felt that way since I was a kid.” Neeson, 68, also confirmed that he had received his first dose of a coronavirus vaccine. New York is the second-largest market for moviegoing in the US, following Los Angeles, where cinemas remain closed. San Francisco’s screens have recently been given the all-clear to reopen with other cities on the west coast are thought to be not far behind. New York’s cinemas will be limited to 25% capacity, with a maximum of 50 people in each screening room. “The reopening of New York is a strong symbolic gesture to the theatre-going audience that it is okay to put your toe in the water,” said Tom Ortenberg, chief of Open Road/Briarcliff, which is distributing The Marksman in the US. The film opened in a number of territories around the world in January, where it has taken $16.4m to date. In a poll released on Thursday, the US’s National Research Group suggested moviegoer confidence is now at its highest level since last summer. Studios are capitalising on this sentiment, with a number moving planned release dates forward, following a year of postponements. The Peter Rabbit sequel, original scheduled for release in February 2020, has moved to 14 May 2021 from 11 June 2021, while the followup to A Quiet Place, which had been set for March 2020, moves forward from this September to 31 May. AMC is the largest cinema chain in the US. All of its 13 venues in New York will reopen on 5 March, with the Regal chain, which is owned by Cineworld, said to be opening an April reopening. Plans for cinema reopening in the UK remain contingent on the roadmap out of lockdown remaining unchanged. But current guidance means indoor cinemas in England would be allowed to reopen from 17 May, while outdoor cinemas would be permitted from 12 April. There is currently no date for reopening for cinemas in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.	491
The siren-wail of Poly Styrene’s voice was the authentic sound of punk: derisive, subversive, yearning and romantic. No one could have been less of a cliche. This riveting and valuable documentary is co-directed by Paul Sng and the musician’s daughter Celeste Bell, and evidently structured in a similar way to Bell’s book, Dayglo: The Poly Styrene Story, published last September. Hearing X-Ray Spex again is a madeleine and an intense pleasure. Poly Styrene was born in 1957 as Marianne Elliott-Said, from a white-British and Somali background, who had a stunning, epiphanic conversion to punk (so many people’s experience) on seeing the Sex Pistols play at the Pavilion on Hastings pier in the long hot summer of 1976, and was born again as Poly Styrene, the name being, as she politely explained to smirking journalists, a “send up of being a pop star”. (A student smart-alec would have overdone the joke by making it Polly with two Ls.) With bold entrepreneurial flair, she assembled a great band and became a driving force of punk and new wave, before her more introspective solo album was critically disliked. She quit the business, having battled against depression and being misdiagnosed with schizophrenia when she had bipolar disorder, accelerated by an introduction to drugs while on tour in the US. Again, this was a very common experience for so many Brit musicians of that era, innocent souls for all their swagger, who were unused to much more than warm beer. (It was certainly true for Sid Vicious, emerging here as an odious bully who mistreated Poly Styrene.) She was a radical and a rebel but also a mystic and a gentle soul, who later embraced Krishna and Indian culture. Her song Identity is an amazing premonition of the 21st-century culture wars (“Identity is the crisis you can’t see / Identity, identity / When you look in the mirror do you see yourself’) although she utterly rejected victimhood-upmanship. The same goes for her fiercely confrontational and unpindownable BDSM-liberation anthem Oh Bondage Up Yours! (Bind me, tie me / Chain me to the wall, / I wanna be a slave to you all, Oh bondage, up yours!”) Elliott-Said’s story is another confirmation of how liberating punk rock was. Who else in late 70s Britain would give the time of day to this hugely talented working-class woman of mixed race? Publishing? Media? Television? Theatre? Of course not – it could only be punk, which she helped to define and energise. There was something authentically heroic about Poly Styrene. • Poly Styrene: I Am a Cliché is released on 5 March on digital formats.	516
It’s not shown in this documentary, but there is a gruesome TV news clip of Vladimir Putin high-fiving Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the G20 summit in November 2018. This was two months after the Saudi author and dissident Jamal Khashoggi had been murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, into whose diplomatically protected precincts he had been lured to get documentation for his planned wedding to the Turkish journalist Hatice Cengiz. Some of the arms-trading western nations duly raised their plaintive and transient objections. Putin himself had no such scruples. The high-five sent a gleeful signal. Saudi Arabia’s state assassination of Khashoggi is of a piece with the Russian-greenlit attempted murder of Sergei Skripal in the UK in March that year (which resulted in the death of a British national, Dawn Sturgess) and it had something in common with North Korea’s bizarre “prank show” killing of Kim Jong-un’s exiled half-brother, Kim Jong-nam, a year before that. The Khashoggi killing is an example of a grisly new political theatre: a nation state sending a mafioso “message” across social and mainstream media to expatriates who think they can criticise the homeland. The Saudis denied it, of course; Donald Trump, typically, accepted Bin Salman’s bland assurances that “rogue” elements had to be involved and even his successor, Joe Biden, has declined to sanction the Saudis. But the damage was done. The one world leader who was outraged was Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, livid that his turf had been encroached on, and his security services duly released the surveillance-tape transcripts, thus casually revealing the open secret that they bug foreign embassies. These documents show in minute-by-minute detail how Khashoggi was overpowered and killed. Bryan Fogel’s documentary about the Khashoggi murder may not reveal anything substantially new, but it’s a fierce, forceful and highly illuminating film, set out with clarity and verve. In a way, Erdoğan has played Deep Throat; his outrage and document-dump did all the work that might have taken investigative journalists years. But there are gripping details. The Saudis flew a sinister security expert and a forensic surgeon with dismemberment expertise into Istanbul on a private jet before the hit as part of a 15-strong team. Khashoggi’s body parts were evidently incinerated in the basement and the consulate had ordered about 30kg (70lb) of meat from a local restaurant, to cook it so that the smell would cover up the awful corpse fumes. Khashoggi himself had for decades before this been a reasonably trusted and loyal journalist in Saudi Arabia. His very moderate and nuanced criticisms made him a plausible ambassadorial spokesperson for a “modernised” Saudi on foreign TV news. But he was energised by the Arab spring during 2011, about which no Middle Eastern country was more furious than Saudi Arabia. Khashoggi befriended the young radical Saudi-born dissident and YouTube megastar Omar Abdulaziz who was exiled in Canada. Like Khashoggi, Abdulaziz had a colossal social media presence – something else that infuriated the Saudi authorities, who employed armies of human keyboard-warrior trolls, nicknamed “the flies”, to abuse dissident voices. (The Saudis did not appear to have matched Russia’s mastery of computerised “bots”.) Khashoggi ended up in exile in Istanbul, from where he was a visitor to the US and wrote well-regarded articles for the Washington Post, and it was Abdulaziz and Khashoggi’s brilliant Twitter counterattack to the flies that infuriated Bin Salman, with lethal consequences. One question remains. How could Khashoggi have been so rash, not merely to have stepped into the consulate building, but to have made a preliminary visit some weeks before that, effectively giving the Saudis time to prepare their assault? Abdulaziz tells Fogel that Khashoggi had specifically warned him against doing the same thing, when Saudi officials smilingly invited him to visit the Saudi embassy in Montreal to “renew his passport”. So was Khashoggi overconfident? Did he think his international prestige protected him? Or was he just human and fallible? He had been forced to divorce his first wife and abandon for ever the idea of seeing his children when he went into his Turkish exile – and then, at the age of 60, he was in love. It is possible that he was thinking of married life as one of gentle retirement in which he would leave the activism to younger people. It is a horrible story of state-sponsored violence from arrogant bullies who calculated – rightly – that they would get away with it. • The Dissident is available from Glasgow film festival, 6-9 March, Dublin film festival on 11 March and on digital formats later in the year.	879
Thirty years have passed since the wedding to end all weddings closed Coming to America, John Landis and Eddie Murphy’s 1988 blockbuster comedy about an African prince who travels from the fictional African kingdom of Zamunda to New York to find a bride. A funeral lineup to rival Glastonbury occurs in the first act of this sequel, proving that the people of Zamunda still know something about spectacle. Co-written by Kenya Barris (Girls Trip) and directed by Craig Brewer (Hustle &amp; Flow, Dolemite Is My Name), this follow-up reverses the first film’s fish-out-of-water plot, with Murphy’s Prince Akeem and sidekick Semmi (Arsenio Hall) returning, briefly, to Queens to retrieve Akeem’s secret “bastard son” Lavelle (Jermaine Fowler). The comedy doesn’t work quite as well this way around, though Fowler is extremely likable as a sweet-natured slacker, channelling the endearing guilelessness of Murphy’s original Prince Akeem. Still, there are enough in-jokes and returning characters to keep fans happy (admirers of Randy Watson and his band Sexual Chocolate needn’t fret). A flashback involving Lavelle’s mum Mary (Ghostbusters’ Leslie Jones) and a pumpkin spice scented candle made me bark with laughter. The film proudly celebrates a wide swathe of Black culture; there’s a throwaway gag about cult TV sitcom Benson, a cameo from 90s R&amp;B group En Vogue, and gorgeous Ankara-print costumes designed by Ruth E Carter (Black Panther). In Zamunda, a woman cannot succeed to the throne or own her own business. To redress the original’s dated gender politics, Akeem’s three daughters (played by KiKi Layne, Akiley Love and Murphy’s real daughter Bella) challenge the sexism baked into their culture. It’s perhaps a milder film as a result, though its efforts feel sincere rather than pandering. • Coming 2 America is on Amazon Prime	370
In this striking documentary, Italian-American film-maker Gianfranco Rosi (Fire at Sea) explores the aftermath of war in the Middle East, filming Iraq, Kurdistan, Syria and Lebanon over a three-year period. Rosi’s method of patient observation allows him to make poetic connections across borders; a military drill that takes place at dawn is juxtaposed with a group of grieving mothers who wander an empty prison in an orderly procession. With no intervening text or voiceover, it can be hard to discern the individual locations and their different political contexts. Instead, Rosi’s broader critique of violence is implied through footage of a play performed by patients in a psychiatric hospital, and of a children’s art therapy class. He is more interested in the reverberations of conflict than the source, focusing on those who have suffered its effects directly. • On Mubi	161
Disney’s latest offering casts Star Wars’ Kelly Marie Tran as the voice of its south-east Asian princess protagonist, the sword-wielding Raya. Her mission is to unite all five pieces of a broken gem containing dragon magic, as well as the fictional Kumandra’s divided regions, in order to defeat a swirling purple plague called the Druun. There is an incandescence and a buoyancy to the animation that elevates the formula. Husky-voiced comedian Awkwafina (The Farewell, Crazy Rich Asians) is captivating as cuddly water dragon Sisu, her goofy earnestness in the same league as Eddie Murphy’s Mushu or Robin Williams’s Genie. • On Disney+	122
There are few pavements in Kabul, so when Shahrbanoo Sadat steps out for her daily walk, she shares the roads with cars and tanks. Military helicopters swirl overhead, creating vast clouds of dust. There are thousands of reasons why you shouldn’t walk around this city, she says, and most people don’t. “It’s a crazy town and sometimes it is scary. But for me, I just love it. You never know what’s going to happen. It makes me feel alive”. It’s that adrenaline rush that’s kept the 30-year-old film-maker rooted to a city while others, including her closest friends, have fled. An unlikely place, perhaps, to make her third film – billed as Afghanistan’s first romantic comedy. “You rarely see a comedy or a musical coming from war-torn countries. There’s this idea that your stories have to be about suffering – and yes, one side of life is full of tragedies. But there are also so many things to laugh about,” Sadat says. The film, Kabul Jan, is a semi-autobiographical tale of a young female camera operator who falls in love with an older, married man – a reporter. One of the main aims, Sadat says, is to challenge the stereotype of Afghan women as weak and repressed. “You see a lot of things she’s up against in her work – fighting for very basic rights every day – but you do not see a victim,” Sadat says. The story is closely tied to her own experience, more than a decade earlier, when she had moved to Kabul after growing up in the mountains of central Afghanistan and begun a relationship with an older male colleague. Incredibly, the two discovered they were actually cousins who had grown up in the same village decades apart. It was that revelation that would inspire her to write her first movie, Wolf and Sheep, based on their shared memories of growing up there – a landscape she describes as “the end of the world”. The film won a prize at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival and made Sadat one of the top-rated directors outside Hollywood. Her second film, The Orphanage, is available on Amazon Prime from Tuesday. “I want to redefine Afghanistan in the film market. This is my dream,” says Sadat. “I have the ideas, I have the details, I have the stories.” All her films are linked by the presence of a male character called Quodrat – a child in the first film, a teen in the second and the male romantic interest in the third. The series (she plans five in total) charts his life and adventures in Afghanistan – echoing many of her own experiences growing up in a poor, rural community where she walked six hours a day to and from school. Her film-making reflects her training at the French Institute of Afghanistan in Kabul where she fell in love with the documentary style of cinéma vérité. “Cinema is all about observation and it’s what I’ve been doing all my life,” she says. “I was never part of any club, I was always on the outside, watching other people.” Sadat was one of the last students to take that workshop. The following year, in 2010, her teacher was killed in a suicide attack and the course closed down. It was another reminder that Kabul is a perilous place to work – and probably more so now than at any time before, she believes – in the midst of uncertain peace talks and with the Taliban in the ascendancy once again. She recognises her love for a city where a bomb might explode at any moment might seem strange to people. “But my life has meaning here,” she says. “I feel like I’m doing something for a place that needs me.”	745
A breezy tale of riot grrrl power passed down from mother to daughter, Amy Poehler’s return to the director’s chair (after 2019’s Wine Country) is a winningly optimistic high-school romp with timely #MeToo-era themes. Adapted by screenwriters Tamara Chestna and Dylan Meyer from the hit YA novel by Jennifer Mathieu, it may lack the depth of Eighth Grade or the punch of Booksmart, but it’s still blessed with enough post-punk energy to raise a smile, several chuckles and the occasional fist-punching cheer. Hadley Robinson is Vivian, a head-down student (“It’s so nice not to be on anyone’s radar”) voted “most obedient” in the crass list compiled by high-school jocks, grotesquely ranking girls in categories including “best rack” and “most bangable”. Like the majority of her female schoolmates, including studious best friend Claudia (Lauren Tsai), Vivian accepts and even expects this kind of everyday sexism, thanks in part to the complacency of Principal Shelly (a smilingly dismissive Marcia Gay Harden) who sees it as just a bit of “fun”. But when no-nonsense new arrival Lucy (Saved By the Bell star Alycia Pascual-Peña) stands up to leering school football idol Mitchell (Patrick Schwarzenegger), Vivian is inspired to join her battle – albeit anonymously. Fired up by an old suitcase packed with the detritus of her mother’s punky past (flyers, badges, cassettes), she knocks together the titular DIY feminist zine, and then secretly distributes it around the washrooms and corridors of East Rockport High. Soon, the whole school is asking: “Who is Moxie?”, as formerly downtrodden girls of all social groups come together, taking a leaf out of the newsletter’s luridly photocopied pages to fight back against the boys. Anyone with a soft spot for spiritedly rebellious high-school pics will find much here that is familiar, whether it’s the internecine intrigues of the Jane Austen-inspired Clueless, the thumbnail sketches of teen cliques so perfectly delineated in the Tina Fey-scripted classic Mean Girls, or the unpicking of sexual politics that harks back to the already heavily genre-reflexive Easy A. There are scenes of wardrobe solidarity that slyly echo the shoulder-strap rebellion of Stick It, and Nico Hiraga is clearly cut from Twilight’s “Team Jacob” cloth as late-bloomer Seth, formerly known as “the shrimp”, now a buff yet sensitive skateboarder who displays a puppyish new-man devotion to Vivian. It would be easy to sneer at the diverse rainbow coalition whom Moxie imagines can suddenly put aside their differences, but the film is smart enough to acknowledge that middle-class white girl Vivian doesn’t have all the answers. A scene in which Claudia has to explain to her best friend that being the daughter of immigrants puts her in a very different position to Vivian strikes exactly the right note. Smart casting is key to Moxie’s appeal, most notably rising star Robinson (previously best known for TV’s Utopia), who hits a well-judged balance between sympathetic, stroppy and occasionally sanctimonious. In the “adult” roles, Ike Barinholtz is spot-on as out-of-his-depth teacher Mr Davies, whose answer to “women’s issues” is to leave the room, while Marcia Gay Harden’s forced smile perfectly suits the principal who appears to lack principles. As for Poehler, she’s in her element as Vivian’s single mom, in search of a quiet life but whose rebellious spirit has not quite been quashed. “When I was 16,” she tells Vivian, “all I cared about was smashing the patriarchy,” a mantle that she has duly – if accidentally – bequeathed to her daughter. A joyous performance by musical youths the Linda Lindas adds sparky charm, taking a lively stab at Bikini Kill’s anthemic Rebel Girl. Such positivity is entirely in keeping with a film that manages to address the spectre of bullying, harassment and rape with a sturdy spirit of defiance, humour and, most importantly, collective optimism.

Dangerously high concentrations of politeness are observed in this dramatisation of the 2011 disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Not only do most of the heroic “50” left behind to avert nuclear catastrophe constantly apologise for underperforming in acts of barely believable self-sacrifice, at one point a manager begs forgiveness for refusing to allow two employees to re-enter the radioactive zone after a failed first attempt. To the feckless western mind more likely to view Homer Simpson as the standard-issue nuclear power-plant employee, it’s a relief when – just for a second – a few Fukushima workers contemplate running away. It is possible director Setsurō Wakamatsu has taken the Hollywood route in portraying the staff as so infallibly courageous – though Fukushima 50 is adapted from journalist Ryusho Kadota’s book, which investigated the response to the earthquake and tsunami in more than 90 interviews. Possibly to avoid lawsuits from Tokyo Electric Power Company executives portrayed here as selfish and shamefully caught on a back foot, everyone in the film is fictionalised – except for prime minister Naoto Kan, though he is never referred to by name, and plant manager Masao Yoshida. Yoshida crucially defies orders and allows the reactors to be cooled with seawater – which prevented meltdown and the possible devastation of Japan’s entire eastern seaboard. The reactors also must be “vented” for pressure manually by workers agonisingly selected for the task. Played by Ken Watanabe as a man having the ultimate bad day at work, the simmering Yoshida looks in need of a similar intervention. Wakamatsu treats his account of these critical hours – the first direct depiction of the disaster, though Sion Sono’s Himizu (2011) was a poetic first responder – like a machine to be kept running at all costs. Often it consists of little more than technicians pelting into crisis rooms, adhering to the Akira school of screaming, with shocking gas-pressure read-outs. The civilian backstories are token, and though the film is critical of the brass, it doesn’t let this anger break into climactic outrage. Yoshida died in 2013 of unrelated oesophageal cancer: Watanabe’s big-shouldered presence makes this an ample tribute to the man, but the film could have been more than an easy clap for his workers. • Fukushima 50 is available from 8 March on digital formats.	431
A plan launched by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association to improve diversity in its membership and bolster the credibility of its Golden Globes awards has been met with scepticism by Time’s Up, one of the film industry’s leading activist organisations. The HFPA released a statement on social media on Sunday announcing “transformational change”, in the wake of stinging criticism before and during the 2021 edition of the Golden Globes a week ago. The organisation pledged to appoint an “expert in organisational diversity, equity and inclusion”, to add “Black and other underrepresented professionals to [the] organisation”, and to improve “transparency” over its voting and membership processes. However, Time’s Up responded immediately, accusing the HFPA of having dragged their feet “for decades”, and questioning the organisation’s commitment. In a statement on social media, Time’s Up said: “On behalf of the many artists who look to us to hold the HFPA’s feet to the fire on the racism, disrespect, misogyny, and alleged corrupt financial dealings of the Golden Globes, we need to see specific details, timetables for change, and firm commitments. The right words are not enough.” According to Deadline, Time’s Up has applied pressure on NBC, the source of the HFPA’s main revenue stream via lucrative payments for broadcasting the Golden Globes, to ensure significant changes take place.	271
It’s 1984: the USSR is on the verge of collapse, and so is Boris Arkadiev (Aleksey Agranovich), a fictional standup who has enormous mainstream success but crumbles under bouts of insecurities. A failed novelist, Boris now tours the country with a banal routine about … a naughty monkey. The KGB approves and the audience roars with laughter, but Boris merely simmers with apathy. Boris’s problems lie in his political spinelessness. His friends chastise him: Simon (Semyon Steinberg), an outspoken writer, mourns Boris’ idealistic literary past; Max (Yuri Kolokolnikov), an actor enamoured with American culture, concludes that the comedian should defect. Adding to the horrors, Boris’ teenage son writes anti-communist rock tunes in a bedroom plastered with posters of David Bowie and T Rex. This failure to communicate reaches a surreal peak when Boris is summoned to perform his routine to a Russian astronaut in space. In one long restless take, Boris paces around a sparsely furnished bunker and breathlessly tells the same old jokes, only for the astronaut to tell him to stop. He has had enough. Boris has, too. This distinctive tendency to mix the weariness and the absurdities of life in the USSR makes The Humorist highly watchable. Agranovich’s performance is outstanding: his body language is subtle, but the actor has a magnetic way of sparking disillusionment or defiance in a simple look. Funnymen with a dark side can make for a great movie – think Lenny or Man on the Moon – but as a rule, the jokes must land; here they just aren’t funny enough. Even when Boris finally snaps and delivers scathingly uncensored jabs at Soviet officials in a bathhouse (another absurdist touch), it falls a bit flat. That’s a shame, as otherwise this is a intriguing time capsule of Soviet history. • The Humorist is released on 12 March on Your Screen.	365
This is a gorgeously gentle feature debut by the Canadian film-maker Geneviève Dulude-De Celles: a calm and tender portrait of a shy 12-year-old as she yo-yos between childhood and adolescence. It is beautifully acted and full of emotional complexity, although at times the storytelling seems a little derivative, with scenes half-familiar from indie’s back catalogue of coming-of-age movies. Emilie Bierre is lovely as Mylia, who is so painfully self-conscious that she hides in a toilet cubicle until the bell rings on her first day at a new school. Mylia lives in the sticks with her parents and younger sister Camille, a little scamp who sits at the breakfast table shoving cereal up her nose (played by newcomer Irlande Côté, who lights up the screen every time she appears). There’s a pang of sadness seeing the two girls together: Mylia leaving behind happy-go-lucky girlhood for what looks like a fragile anxious period of being a teenager. And the world is in a hurry to make her grow up, to sexualise her. One of the popular girls (Cassandra Gosselin-Pelletier), takes a shine to Mylia, inviting her to a party where there’s alcohol and a boy who likes her. (He’s got the shifty look of having just watched two hours of porn on his phone.) A much better option is Jimmy (Jacob Whiteduck-Lavoie), a soulful, long-haired kid in Mylia’s class; he is of Abenaki descent (though a subplot involving racism towards First Nations people at school feels a bit unthought-through). The script sensitively shows why her choices are a big deal. Which boy will be her first kiss? Should she party with the cool clique? Mylia is creating the blueprint for her identity as a teenager. It’s mostly an engrossing watch, but occasionally generic: these first experiences are pretty universal but feel a little reprocessed. Still, what an impressive debut. • A Colony is released on 15 March on Mubi.	371
Nomadland boosted its position as Oscars frontrunner and The Crown confirmed its dominance of the TV awards cycle after the pair repeated their Golden Globes success in the Critics’ Choice awards, handed out by the group for TV, radio and online critics in the US and Canada in a largely virtual event hosted by actor Taye Diggs. Nomadland, the drama about retirees roaming the US in search of work after the 2008 financial crash, won four awards, including best picture and best director for Chloé Zhao; however, Frances McDormand, long considered an Oscar favourite, lost out in the best actress category to Carey Mulligan for Promising Young Woman. Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom emerged in second place with three awards, including best actor for the late Chadwick Boseman in his role as trumpeter Levee Green in the 1920s-set music drama. As at the Globes, where Boseman won the same award, the actor’s wife Taylor Simone Ledward accepted it on his behalf, saying in an emotional speech that “his work in this film deserves this – he deserves this”. In the TV categories, Netflix’s royal family saga The Crown took best drama series, and three acting prizes: for Josh O’Connor as Prince Charles, Emma Corrin as Princess Diana and Gillian Anderson as Margaret Thatcher in the best actor, actress and supporting actress in a drama series respectively. Ted Lasso, the series starring Jason Sudeikis as a Premier League football manager, came out on top in the comedy categories, winning best comedy series, best comedy actor for Sudeikis, and best comedy supporting actress for Hannah Waddingham. Elsewhere in the TV sections the awards were shared around, with The Queen’s Gambit picking up two, for best limited series and best actress in a limited series for Anya Taylor-Joy.

This challenging Colombian parable feels like it could have been made in the 1970s, what with its cryptic storytelling, spiritual musings and vivid imagery, all shot on grainy 16mm. Rejecting conventional narrative structures, its story takes some decoding, and may well defy comprehension, but its striking visual language, with vibrant colours, sparse compositions and free-associative editing, casts quite a spell. Our protagonist is a bearded, long-haired young vagrant named Pinky (Luis Felipe Lozano), whom we first find shooting a man, stealing a motorbike, then getting high in an abandoned warehouse. It transpires he has recently left a cult and has killed its leader. We never see the cult in question, but in voiceover we learn of the hold its leader had on Pinky and other outcasts: “We had been miraculously saved from a world that had always seen us as worthless.” Fragments of Pinky’s experience are presented with little distinction between real and imagined. He spends time at a counterfeit T-shirt printing workshop. He recounts the tale of a beggar addict who believes they’re in a parallel world underground. He strips copper wire from buildings. He has a bewildering encounter with a man (who may be an incarnation of the cult leader) in a forest, where it is unclear who is going to kill whom. There are echoes here of Chilean auteur Alejandro Jodorowsky in the disorienting stew of metaphor and mysticism, and the sheer logic-defying strangeness of it all. Lozano even bears a physical resemblance to Jodorowsky in his head-trip classic The Holy Mountain. But director Camilo Restrepo seems less concerned with psychedelic spiritual questing than commenting on Colombia’s real social and political decay. The film ends with a poem by Gonzalo Arango (which could be a key to deciphering the entire exercise) that asks: “When will Colombia stop killing its sons?” Oblique and impenetrable as it is, it’s a memorable experience. • Los Conductos is available from 11 March on Mubi.	375
It should be cause for celebration that we have reached the stage where we can have a Hollywood movie with an all-star cast of Asian-descended actors. Disney’s Raya and the Last Dragon (out now on Disney+ at a premium price) is voiced by the likes of Star Wars’s Kelly Marie Tran, Awkwafina, Gemma Chan, Daniel Dae Kim, Sandra Oh and Benedict Wong. We are in a good moment for representation in movies in general, when you factor in awards contenders such as Chinese director Chloé Zhao’s Nomadland and the Korean-American tale Minari. But might it also be the time to retire “Asian” as a category? As an adjective that applies to 60% of the world’s population, from Turkmenistan to India to China, it’s not exactly fit for purpose. Was it ever? Raya and the Last Dragon illustrates how unhelpful a description it can be. It is set in the fictional realm of Kumandra, which is very much south-east Asian. Its artists researched cultures across the region: Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia. That work is reflected in the movie’s meticulous visual detail: the architecture, the landscape, the food, the weaponry, the costumes, the colours. To an outside eye, at least, it seems to have been done diligently and respectfully. One problem: apart from Tran (whose parents are from Vietnam), most of Raya’s voice cast are of Chinese or Korean descent – so east Asian, rather than south-east Asian. The move has inevitably drawn criticism online. One open letter to Disney from a California university dismissed Raya as “not real representation”. In its defence, many of Raya’s team are south-east Asian, including the writers Qui Nguyen and Adele Lim. But the issue is compounded by Raya’s fictionalised setting, which effectively smushes together a highly diverse region. Disney has some form in composite fictional realms: see Aladdin (set in “Agrabah”, AKA “some Arabic kinda place”), or Moana’s Polynesian isle of “Motunui”. Not to mention Black Panther’s Wakanda, although its geographic obscurity was part of the point, and faithful to the comic books. In contrast, Disney’s European tales tend to be more specific: Brave’s Scotland or Beauty and the Beast’s France. How would we feel about a movie land that smushed together, say, England, France and Germany? Then again, Frozen, with its pan-Scandinavian setting, comes close. As does some Japanese anime: Kiki’s Delivery Service, for example, takes place in a generic “Europe”. Maybe generically “south-east Asian” is progress compared to generically “Asian”? Some on Twitter have expressed delight at their culture being seen by Hollywood. It’s a fine line between representation and appropriation, but Disney is at least prepared to try to tread it.	566
I’m not here to defend the accent. You can have that. I am not going to say that in PS I Love You, Gerard Butler – whose real accent will remain a secret until the day he dies – does a good impression of an Irishman. Although it’s a lot better than reviewers gave it credit for, that is not a hill on which I will get wounded, let alone die. But I have to stand up for one of the most unjustly smeared films of the last 20 years, nay of all time. PS I Love You is based on the Cecelia Ahern novel of the same name. It’s about Holly (Hilary Swank) trying to cope after her husband Gerry (Butler) dies in his 30s of a brain tumour. It doesn’t sound like thigh-cracking stuff, which is what makes its success all the more fantastic. Rewatching the film, I basically start crying about 12 minutes in. A long first scene shows us Holly and Gerry arguing as they walk into their too-small New York apartment, unconsciously undressing for bed as they snap and bicker. The argument and reconciliation, which Empire described as “one of the worst scenes of the year”, is utterly believable: the frustration at the parallel conversations sailing past each other; the extraordinary way in which the couple make up, breathlessly kissing each other by way of apology. Knowing that Gerry is soon to die paints these moments a sickly grey, and the sentimental trap of pretending the relationship was perfect is skillfully avoided. There’s a peculiar snobbery that taints the reception to films like PS I Love You. It’s about love, I think. There can be immense self-satisfaction in pissing on films that honestly try to capture the ugly ecstasy of all-consuming love. Reviewing for the Guardian, Peter Bradshaw slapped the label “necrophiliac high concept” on this film about a woman trying to deal with the paralysing grief of losing the love of her life. Richard Curtis once pointed out that his films are criticised for being unrealistic but “If you make a film about a soldier who goes awol and murders a pregnant nurse – something that’s happened probably once in history – it’s called searingly realistic analysis of society.” You don’t have to like Curtis or PS I Love You to see his point. This doesn’t mean that every film about love is a good film – Ryan Murphy’s The Prom proves this – but it’s harder to admit that you were moved by a tender portrayal of love than it is to say that a show about gangsters is good. By 2007 it was cool to mock romcoms, especially ones that dared to say more than one thing. Another odd criticism of PS I Love You was that it varies wildly in tone. In scoring an easy point, this accusation missed something blindingly obvious: life varies weirdly and wildly in tone as well. If it didn’t vary in tone, the film would be unrelentingly depressing. That is one of the points of the film: even if you are at the bottom of a barrel of misery, contemplating your husband’s death, humour will find you. At every funeral someone is desperately trying to hold in a fart. To paint the film as a weird romance between a living woman and a dead man is to deliberately misunderstand it. It isn’t just because of the morbid cloud hanging over the film that the flashback scenes of Holly and Gerry meeting for the first time almost move me to tears. They are also gorgeously realised, rose-tinted depictions of love blossoming. Meeting the couple in their 30s and then rewinding 10 years is clever: when they say goodbye after that first encounter, we know they will see each other again. But Gerry doesn’t know – and the agonised longing in his eyes is all too convincing. I write about bad films from time to time. One of the things that unites them, I think, is that they elicit a response from their audience entirely divorced from the one they intended to. PS I Love You does the exact opposite. It is heartbreaking when it wants to be heartbreaking, and hilarious when it wants to be hilarious. In what sense it’s supposed to be a bad film therefore remains a mystery. There are times when the majority is right. But, as 2016 taught us, there are times when it is wrong. It was wrong in 2007 as well. I am not pretending that PS I Love You is The Godfather. It’s better than that (I’m kidding). But there is just as much skill in making people laugh and cry as there is in making people stroke their chin in approval. And no amount of snobbery can disguise that. PS I love this film. PS I Love You is available on HBO Max in the US and on Amazon Prime and Netflix in the UK	948
The shortcomings of the much-anticipated comedy sequel Coming 2 America are too many to list. But they all begin and end with the unfortunate yet predictable truth that the film simply didn’t need to be made. Inundated with tired tropes and stereotypes of black people on both sides of the vast Atlantic, it is difficult to grasp the objectives of the movie, parse through its dubious humour and imagine who its intended audience is. The writers (Kenya Barris, Barry W Blaustein, David Sheffield) are self-aware enough of fans’ preconceived skepticism concerning the project, to insert a dialogue in which newly introduced characters absent in the film’s prequel, Coming to America, confess this follow-up’s lack of purpose. Lavelle (Jermaine Fowler) – who plays the long-lost son of the prince-turned-King Akeem (Eddie Murphy) – points out to his bona fide Zamunda romantic interest, Mirembe (Nomzamo Mbatha), that her love of American movies ignores that American cinema now includes remakes nobody asked for. It’s a warranted self-deprecating quip. It’s also a rare moment in the film that is actually funny, which is a far cry from its 1988 predecessor. Even today, the first Coming to America holds its own as a comedy classic. It evokes nostalgia cross-culturally and across several generations who came of age during it, or at least watched it in the decade or so that came after, part of a much-loved childhood canon. Notwithstanding, from its first arrival and since, there have been many criticisms for its portrayal of Africa in the form of its fictional Zamunda nation, reducing the continent’s representation to an ahistorical facade of mostly simple-minded people occupying, by contrast, an ostentatious kingdom. If this were Coming 2 America’s main error, then it might even be redeemable to some if it were also funny, charming, and had a stimulating plot. It has none of these. Comedy, like every other film genre, can both meet its bar and contain elements that leave much to be desired; a film’s failure in one area does not preclude it from being enjoyable and more importantly, succeeding as a whole. The entire problem of Coming 2 America is not only is the whole not greater than the sum of its parts, there are simply no great parts. What does stand out though is how the film employs and weaponizes stereotypes of both Africans and black Americans in its depictions. On the one hand, Zamundans are yet again represented as simple-minded, the emphasis on their backwardness might even be more prevalent in the sequel than in the original. Added to this, is a cultural landscape that has simply evolved. Allowing for such an archaic portrayal without an amusing narrative to complement it negates the possibility of levity for old and new audiences that have both been shaped by a more nuanced understanding of culture and representation. On the other hand, the portrayal of Lavelle and his family, notably his mother, Mary (Leslie Jones), and uncle, Reem (Tracy Morgan), also engages in a disturbing rendering of working-class black Americans and how they might participate in cultures beyond their own. Among the film’s transgressions is also a shocking revelation that Lavelle is the consequence of Mary having had non-consensual sex with Prince Akeem, which is utilized as comedic fodder for all involved. Surely, a more imaginative and less dreadful event – it needn’t even be funny – could have provided a suitable explanation. In an industry that was supposedly reinvigorated by a #MeToo era less than three years ago, adopting humour alongside any depiction of sexual assault is a huge risk. It’s not that it can’t be done, but it must serve a greater ambition than operating as a mere plot point and be treated as more than a careless occurrence. A combination of the trifold examples of an obsolete use of sexual assault humour, bygone representations of Africans and classist caricatures of black Americans altogether encapsulates the film’s unnecessary existence. Coming 2 America fails to both update its sensibilities to this era (despite a half-hearted attempt to, along the way, force in some perfunctory feminist ideas) and reproduce the fantastical but funny notions that made the original genuinely great, in spite of its flaws. Despite their ubiquity, sequels remain a tough sell for an audience hoping to take equal or similar pleasure to what they did the first time around, something especially true when the originals are held in such esteem as Coming to America. Even if this second film had been good, it was always going to be a tough act to follow because of its built-in audience. That it is so spectacularly inadequate, unable to even meet its own genre minimum of entertainment, much less demonstrate any increased aptitude in its representation, is a testament to the only thing the film got right: nobody asked for this.	925
The Bafta nominations seem this year to have answered two perennial objections: that they are not diverse enough and – perhaps paradoxically – not British enough. Four out of the six best director nominees are women: Chloé Zhao for the docufictional road movie Nomadland, Sarah Gavron for the explosively energetic social-realist Rocks, Jasmila Žbanić for Quo Vadis, Aida?, a gruelling reconstruction of the Srebrenica massacre during the Bosnian war, and Shannon Murphy for her family dysfunction drama Babyteeth. Bafta has also expanded the outstanding British film category to 10 entries, apparently in honour of the entrants’ strength (although this is arguably an artificial bit of goalpost moving). The star of this category is Rocks, which jointly leads the pack with a handsome seven nods, level with Nomadland; Florian Zeller’s harrowing dementia drama The Father gets six, along with Emerald Fennell’s brilliant rape-revenge satire Promising Young Woman. The outstanding British debut section – long considered the beating heart of the Baftas, and the category where a nomination can launch a career – has a lot of duplications with outstanding British film, and it’s great to see double-nods for Ben Sharrock’s wonderful refugee movie Limbo and Rose Glass’s outstanding horror Saint Maud. As for snubs, I’m sorry to see Bafta pretty much turn its nose up at Christopher Nolan’s colossal metaphysical thriller Tenet (a single nomination). The foreign-language category is a terrific list with Andrei Konchalovsky’s Dear Comrades!, Lee Isaac Chung’s Minari, Žbanić for Quo Vadis, Aida? and Ladj Ly’s Les Misérables – but I’m a bit mystified at the reverential adulation for Thomas Vinterberg’s amusing but facetious and directionless booze comedy Another Round, when there were better films like Alejandra Márquez Abella’s The Good Girls, Shahrbanoo Sadat’s The Orphanage and Roy Andersson’s About Endlessness. But Rocks really has scored a resounding success with its seven nominations: the Brit social-realist adventure written by Theresa Ikoko and Claire Wilson, directed by Sarah Gavron, and starring newcomer Bukky Bakray as “Rocks” – a Nigerian-British girl in east London who has to look after her brother Emmanuel when her mum vanishes. It’s a film fizzing with energy, creativity, love and fun and it would be great to see this film triumph on the night. As for Nomadland, Chloé Zhao’s inspired generic hybrid film stars Frances McDormand playing a fictional “nomad”, one of the formerly prosperous US retirees financially stricken by the 2008 crash and forced to sell up and go on the road in their vans and RVs – McDormand plays opposite real nomads and Zhao’s mix of real and imagined is masterly. The massive reputation of Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman has clearly spread the word about The Father to Bafta voters well in advance of its planned June release date – its six nominations include best actor for Hopkins in the unforgettably harrowing role of “Anthony”, an ageing man succumbing to dementia and finding that his whole world is beginning to unravel into meaninglessness, to the horror of his daughter, played by Colman. David Fincher’s gorgeous monochrome Mank, an alt-reality guide to the making of Orson Welles’s Citizen Kane and the role played by its co-writer Herman Mankiewicz, played by Gary Oldman, also has six nominations, though I wonder if the tally for this exquisitely made but non-crowdpleasing film will melt away on the night. Promising Young Woman is a fiercely confrontational and inspired satire though it is strange that Carey Mulligan, its star, has no nomination for best actress. The Dig, starring Ralph Fiennes and Mulligan, about the archaeological find of the 20th century, has been a word-of-mouth grower for Netflix, building a strong fanbase and it has five nominations – I wouldn’t bet against Moira Buffini getting a Bafta for her adapted screenplay. Elsewhere, the Guantánamo drama The Mauritanian also has five nominations, including one for best film, but I think this rather fence-sitting liberal patriot drama is overblown. One best actress nomination is really heartening: Alfre Woodard was overlooked in last year’s Academy awards for her magnificent performance as the troubled prison governor who has to preside over a controversial death penalty in Clemency. Its delayed UK release means that she is in line for a Bafta, and it would be wonderful to see her rewarded.	826
Algerian-Swiss film-maker Karim Sayad has here created a sweetly indulgent portrait of his “English cousin” Fahed: a pudgy, smiley, good-natured guy sloping about the place in his England shirt, someone whom you can easily imagine as a little boy. Twenty years ago, Fahed came to the UK from Algeria illegally and started out sleeping rough. Now, with a frustrating and burdensome existence in Grimsby working two jobs in a factory and a kebab shop and estranged from his English partner, he has a yearning to return to Algeria to be close to his mother. He even claims that there is an Algerian woman back home who wants to be his fiancee. Sayad follows Fahed back to the old country, where the prodigal son finds a warm but tense situation. Fahed’s mum and his aunt are affectionate but exasperated at Fahed’s evasiveness on the subject of this woman to whom he’s supposed to have proposed: he doesn’t sound excited to be getting married and we never actually see his intended. Will Fahed settle back down in Algeria? It’s doubtful, for the simple reason that the people that he really seems to like – he lights up in their company – are his mates back in Grimsby, the lads that he shares a house with and goes to the pub with. This is an opaque film; for all the directness of Sayad’s film-making style, there is an awful lot Fahed is keeping back from us. He won’t really open up to his mum or his aunt, and Sayad himself isn’t going to break cover and ask questions. The film leaves it up to us to decide whether or not Fahed’s decisions are the right ones. • My English Cousin is released on 12 March on True Story.	341

There are some strong ideas and sharply observed family dysfunction drama in this feature debut by documentary maker Ed Morris. But none are enough to stop the film sinking into silliness, with a highly implausible abduction followed by a road trip across the South Downs. Bridgerton’s Ruby Barker plays troubled 19-year-old Yakira, who lives with her dad, his second wife and her lairy 12-year-old half-sister Kelly (Lily-Rose Aslandogdu). Family life is an emotional battlefield in their suburban semi, the two girls constantly at each other’s throats. Yakira resents the way their parents ignore Kelly’s nasty nickname for her: “No mum.” The whereabouts of her birth mother isn’t revealed until later on, but Barker’s compelling performance hints at a childhood trauma that has left Yakira feeling adrift in the world, vulnerable and impulsive. One night, after an explosive family row, Yakira kidnaps her sister while she sleeps. The logistics of this are the film’s first major plausibility lapse: is it actually possible to lift a 12-year-old out of bed, down some stairs and into a car without waking her up? Anyway, the plan is to take Kelly across the South Downs to visit Yakira’s mum. But when Kelly wakes up and flips, Yakira locks her in the boot. The police – called by their worried parents – launch a surprisingly well-resourced manhunt. Things go from bad to worse for Yakira when she accidentally picks up a hitchhiker (Andre Flynn). He looks like he’s walked out of a village hall production of Brideshead Revisited with a white suit, floppy hair and boarding-school sneer. Actually, he’s a drug dealer – and with his arrival the movie sinks into contrivance, increasingly forced and silly. Still, nothing can rub the shine off Barker’s huge talent; she is totally authentic even if the film is half-baked. • How to Stop a Recurring Dream is released on 9 March on digital platforms. • This article was amended on 12 March 2021. The actor who plays the hitchhiker is Andre Flynn, not Adam Hugill as an earlier version stated.	403
The long-awaited “Snyder cut” of the superhero movie Justice League was accidentally released on streaming service HBO Max on Monday, before being removed. According to the Hollywood Reporter, customers who were attempting to access the new Tom and Jerry movie found that instead the service played Zack Snyder’s Justice League, which is due to be released on 19 March. One user reported on social media that more than an hour of the film (which has an official run time of 242 minutes) was screened. The new version was created after a fan campaign that began after the release of the original film in 2017, to unimpressed reviews. It starred Ben Affleck as Batman, Jason Momoa as Aquaman and Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, who team up to battle supervillain Steppenwolf. Snyder, the film’s credited director, left the project in May 2017 during postproduction, following the death of his daughter. Joss Whedon, who had co-written the film’s script and directed Marvel superhero films The Avengers and Avengers: Age of Ultron, took over the and reportedly set up extensive reshoots. After the film was removed from HBO Max, takedown notices were reportedly sent to social media users who had posted screenshots of the film.	233
Grief is a contradictory emotion: an intangible state of mind, while inducing overwhelming physical responses. Mazen Khaled’s masterly Martyr strikes the right balance as it simultaneously grounds the act of grieving in the real as well as the abstract. On a hot summer day in Beirut, Hassane (Hamza Mekdad) is restless. He lives with his parents who constantly nag him to get a job. Even his masturbation session in the shower is interrupted by his father grumbling about water waste. Dreaming of being submerged in the ocean, Hassane tries to find release at the seaside with his friends, equally aimless loafers who complain about stifling Beirut and their dire romantic prospects. Hassane, in a moment of bizarre clarity, climbs up above the rocky beach and takes a fatal dive. His body crashes into the water and suddenly, all that visible is sea-foam. Hassane doesn’t come up again. Like death, grief, too, is a kind of crash. Suddenly, Martyr erupts into freeze-frames. They capture Hassane’s body stretched out and gently carried by numerous pairs of arms and hands, as his friends bring him home. The moment death enters Hassane’s household, everyday life is irretrievably disrupted, and the film veers into experimentalism. At one point, Hassane’s mother (Carol Abboud) is seamlessly teleported to a black limbo where she and other female mourners grieve in the form of dance. In other hands, such stylistic choices might come off as gauche, but here they are cathartic; the mother’s devastating disbelief is violently exorcised. In Martyr, life and death are linked through such gestures. Moreover, while the sexual orientation of the men is unclear, there is a homoeroticism in their touch that nurtures Hassane from his adulthood to his sudden death. Grief can also be sensuous; that the same hands which have sunned with Hassane on the beach are now washing him for his final rites is pure cinematic poetry. • Martyr is released on 12 March on digital platforms.	383
Writing-directing collaborators Andy Collier and Tor Mian’s follow-up to their well-received debut, cops-and-Satanists Charismata, constructs a classic fish-out-of-water premise by sending a wholesome average American guy, Isaac (Ludovic Hughes), and his heavily pregnant wife, Emma (Sophie Stevens), to a remote Norwegian island to claim a house Isaac has inherited. There, they find that the locals are pagans, that all dreams are bad and tentacled monsters lurk not just in the sea but also down the drain. So maybe that makes this a fish-in-the-water story. Or you could call it an invertebrate-in-the-water, if you want to be as pedantic as the Norwegian bartender who almost starts a fight with Isaac over the nature of calamari in one of the early scenes. Either way, the quirky script, adapted from a short story by Paul Kane and, as the opening credits assert, inspired by the work of HP Lovecraft, is quite good on the cultural friction between Americans and Europeans. It draws very deep from the well of uncanny associations that come with horror stories set in northern Europe such as The Wicker Man and Midsommar. Add this one to the mix and we almost have a mini-genre: you could call it Doggerland Gothic. Sacrifice’s contribution to the canon is notable, throwing in anxieties around a Nordic tendency towards madness brought on by long nights, northern lights, aquavit and too much skinny-dipping in icy waters. Collier and Mian have a lot of fun with nightmare fakeouts, casting doubt on what’s real and what’s a dream; together with the coloured gels used in the cinematography, this gives the whole thing a 1970s giallo vibe. Just to ice that cake of dried blood, the lovely Barbara Crampton, doyenne of classic horror films such as Re-Animator and From Beyond, is on hand as the local policewoman/high priestess, serving up menace with the pan-fried trout. • Sacrifice is released on 15 March on digital platforms.	366
Think of a yes day as The Purge for kids. For 24 hours every year, (almost) all laws don’t apply. Their parents, who usually and understandably say no to the majority of requests, are forced to say yes to everything as long as it doesn’t result in death or some sort of illegal behaviour. It’s apparently a thing that happens, inspired by the children’s book by Amy Krouse Rosenthal and Tom Lichtenheld, and while the idea might give even those of us adults who don’t have kids a severe case of night sweats, it’s one that will drive anyone younger into a frenzy. It’s a not uninteresting concept although in Miguel Arteta’s puppyish Netflix comedy Yes Day, it’s not one that gets explored beyond the thrill of eating lots of ice cream or going to a theme park. In under 90 minutes (the credits arrive after just 79 of them), fun is had, lessons are learned and enough pratfalls take place for one to worry about serious injuries but there’s a sense of magic missing, a charm that comes in teaspoonfuls rather than spades. The family dynamic is one that’s familiar to anyone with a cursory knowledge of how Hollywood likes to portray them: mum Allison (Jennifer Garner) is the disciplinarian, the one who insists that homework be done and messes be cleared, while dad Carlos (Edgar Ramirez) is more laidback, frantic at work but carefree at home. Their three kids are tired of the restrictions placed upon them, especially eldest Katie (Jenny Ortega) who thinks that at 14 she should be allowed more freedom, incensed that her mother won’t allow her to attend a music festival with a friend (dad of course said yes). After Allison and Carlos endure a rather embarrassing parent-teacher meeting where they’re informed just how much their children hate Allison’s brand of parenting (one makes a video comparing her to Stalin, one writes a haiku comparing her to a captor), they’re given an idea by an eavesdropping teacher. With his six kids, he practices a yes day once in a while. It has to be earned by good grades and good behaviour in the weeks preceding and there are important caveats but it allows them to blow off steam and see their parents in a fun light again. Allison, desperate to be viewed more favorably, and Carlos, desperate for peace, agree to it and (moderate, easy to clean up) hell breaks loose. Unlike the many family films that have come before it with a similar gender dynamic, there’s at least a vague awareness here of the unfair positioning at play – have fun with dad while rolling eyes at mum – and there are some broad attempts at trying to redress the balance. In one of the more specific scenes, Garner also gets a jolt of a job interview as she attempts to re-enter the workforce after bringing up three kids (“I never stopped working, I just stopped getting paid for it”) being politely informed that she seems far too nice and mature to take on an “entitled millennial’s” entry-level position that would leave her crying into her gluten-free burrito (“I wouldn’t want to do that to you, I like you too much”). But any of the more interestingly observed elements of the story soon fade for the main event, 24 hours of kid-controlled mayhem, which wouldn’t be as much of a problem if the chaos was a little bit more creative. But the stakes are too low, the conflict too minimal and the ideas too undercooked. I’m not saying I wanted the kids to engage in some sort of disturbing psychological warfare with their parents but I wanted a little bit more than going through the carwash with the windows open, some more imagination wouldn’t have gone amiss. Arteta’s had a funny old career, creating three genuinely striking dark comedies (Chuck &amp; Buck, The Good Girl and Beatriz at Dinner) and a TV show (Enlightened) with Mike White but finding himself adrift in recent years going, from annoying (Duck Butter) to unfunny (Like a Boss) and now to this, serviceable enough for undiscerning young viewers but lacking in much of a spark. We don’t spend enough time with the family pre-yes day to really understand or care about their dynamic beyond the blandest of strokes and the emotional climax is therefore hard to muster up the vaguest of damns about. Garner gives an earnest but edgeless performance while Ramirez seems a little lost so it’s up to an energetic Ortega to add some life, drawing us in while everything around her is pushing us out. If you need a charming film headed up by a skilled comic actor about a family going through troubling times then watch Rose Byrne in Instant Family instead because it’s a big no for this one. Yes Day is available on Netflix on 12 March	960
A strong setup is constrained by limited resources – financial and possibly creative –in this gloomy thriller set in damp rural Ireland. The story begins on a macabre note: gangly, troubled teenager Tom (Anson Boon) discovers a sack in a shallow lake containing the bones of a human baby. The lake is on the land of the rundown farmhouse he has just moved into with his mother, Elaine (Charlie Murphy), who looks young enough to be his sister. They clearly have their own baggage: Tom’s past behaviour is blamed for their relocation. The fresh start turns even sourer when they meet their nearest neighbours: grizzled farmer Ward (Michael McElhatton) and his teenage daughter Holly played by Emma Mackey, star of teen series Sex Education; she holds her own with the Irish accent, but this does little more for her CV. They, too, have their family baggage, it soon transpires. Tom’s mother is at first flirtatious with Ward, inviting him in for a whiskey at the first opportunity. Holly strikes up a parallel friendship with Tom, despite the fact he is withdrawn to the point of being almost mute. Her ulterior motives are not difficult to fathom after she spots the sack of bones in his possession. But then nobody is really being truthful in this claustrophobic situation, which allows in little in the way of trust or genuine affection. Things start off sombre and get darker, literally as well as tonally. The crisp cinematography and eerie score build up some tension, but with so few principal characters, the mystery of the baby is not difficult to solve, and a few too many plot contrivances lead to an anticlimactic resolution. There’s promise here but also perhaps some uncertainty: ultimately it falls between the stools of realist rural drama and full-on horror. • The Winter Lake is released on 15 March on digital platforms.	358
There is a school of thought that Elizabeth Banks’s version of Charlie’s Angels flopped because it was too familiar; it was in effect a reboot of a reboot of an iconic television series that had long wrung itself dry. People knew exactly what to expect from it, so they stayed away. That’s unlikely to happen with her next film, though, because her next film is going to be called Cocaine Bear. And, I mean, you’re in, right? You’d watch a film called Cocaine Bear. Regardless of quality or budget or genre, you’d watch Cocaine Bear. You wouldn’t even buy your tickets online, because that would rob you of the opportunity to say out loud to a cinema employee: “I would like to spend my own money to watch a film called Cocaine Bear.” The mind boggles at all the different things that Cocaine Bear could be. It could be Scarface with a bear, or Easy Rider with a bear, or City of God with a bear. It could even be The Business with a bear, though that would probably be a tragic waste of both cocaine and bears. Either way, it’s a film with bears and cocaine in it. You’re in, right? Except Cocaine Bear is going to be based on a real story about a real bear that had a run-in with some real cocaine in the 1980s. And that automatically takes the story from “immediately hilarious” to “potentially quite harrowing”. Especially since the story of what happened is both quite short and pointedly sad. In December 1985, a bear was walking around Chattahoochee-Oconee national forest, minding its own business, when it found 40 plastic bags of cocaine worth $15m. So it ate them, and then died. The medical examiner who performed an autopsy on the bear said the cause of death was: “Cerebral haemorrhaging, respiratory failure, hyperthermia, renal failure, heart failure, stroke. You name it, that bear had it.” Its stomach was “literally packed to the brim with cocaine”, he said. “There isn’t a mammal on the planet who could survive that.” Which sort of takes the shine off Cocaine Bear a bit, because a film where a real bear suffering a miserable drug overdose alone in the frozen woods doesn’t exactly scream blockbuster. Fortunately, it’s likely that the film will tell the story of why the bear found the cocaine, which is a humdinger of a caper. It turns out that the man who left the cocaine in the woods was Andrew Thornton, a corrupt narcotics officer who had become the head of an international drug smuggling operation. Though he was first arrested in 1981, the police released him in the hope that he would lead them to more powerful figures connected with the drug trade, possibly even government officials. However, while transporting cocaine by plane four years later, he ran into engine trouble. Frightened, he dumped as much of it out of the plane’s doors as he could, and then evacuated by parachute. But the parachute didn’t open properly, and Thornton died on impact 50 miles away in Knoxville, next to 70lb of cocaine, thousands of dollars in cash and three weapons. Which is a fun enough story. It sounds a little like the 2017 Tom Cruise film American Made. But, then again, it does end with a real-life bear, frightened and disorientated and suffering an unthinkably agonising death. And whatever you thought of American Made, you have to admit that its climax didn’t involve a bear choking on its vomit in unbelievable pain, which has to be a good thing. And that means that Cocaine Bear might not be the zany fun-time comedy that its title suggests. That said, the press at the time did dub the poor creature “Pablo Escobear”. You’re back in, right?	756
Justice is not delayed but could still be denied in this arresting Filipino movie, which tracks a case of domestic abuse with such conviction, it is often easy to forget it’s staged drama rather than documentary. The first half-hour is especially frantic and immersive as it begins with the assault in question. Hard-up Manila mother Joy (Max Eigenmann) is preparing supper for her young daughter, Angel, in their cramped, cluttered little apartment. Her husband Dante (Kristoffer King) returns home drunk. A violent argument quickly erupts, in which Joy is brutally beaten and Dante slashed on the arm with a knife. As the police and women’s protection services intervene, we’re pitched almost in real time through the Manila night: down streets, through homes, into and out of vehicles, through police stations and to a clinic, swept along by agile, up-close, handheld camerawork. Adding to the trauma, Joy and Dante are dealt with practically side by side throughout. Calm mercifully prevails for a spell after Joy presses charges, although the demands of the Filipino justice system mean each side must gather their own witnesses and negotiate various circles of bureaucratic hell – still conducted through piles of paperwork. The eventual trial is gripping but infuriating: we’re in no doubt that childish, semi-criminal Dante is the guilty party, but his family enlists a smart lawyer who runs rings around the overstretched public prosecutor. There is an ironic twist to this particular case, but is clearly a drop in an ocean of domestic abuse that goes unreported or unpunished. The overall impression is of a legal system more concerned with expediency than justice: chaotic, rushed, patriarchal, under-resourced and open to abuse. Director Raymund Ribay Gutierrez, a protege of local auteur Brillante Mendoza, directs with empathy and energy here; he’s a name to watch. • Verdict is released on 12 March on digital platforms.	363
Why have one actor play your lead character when you could have two? That’s the central conceit of this distinctive Canadian indie, written by the actors in question, Amy Nostbakken and Norah Sadava, and adapted from their stage play. They are both Cassandra, a disorganised woman in Toronto thrown into crisis by the death of her mother. Unlike movies with similar conceits – Luis Buñuel’s That Obscure Object of Desire, for example, where two actors alternated in a role – Mouthpiece keeps both women on screen at all times. As a reflection of a fractured mental state, it’s an effective device, although the relationship is not sharply defined. Sometimes they are like best friends or sisters, in playful internal dialogue; others they are in good cop/bad cop opposition, or even conflict. Sometimes their movements are identical (they trip over their scarves in synch, for example); at others they appear to be autonomous. The comic potential of the setup is largely sidestepped although a highlight is a scene where one Cassandra chimes in with distracting criticisms while her other self is trying to have sex with an old flame. As the Cassandras traverse snowy Toronto, making preparations for the funeral, flashbacks fill in a difficult mother-daughter relationship. Mother (Maev Beaty) was a smart, free-spirited, Joni Mitchell-loving divorcee, who has clearly transmitted her resentments and anxieties to her daughter. Female identity and its construction from within and without are to the fore, albeit from a certain perspective: as one Cassandra points out to the other: “You’re a white, thin, middle-class, educated, hetero Canadian.” It’s directed by Patricia Rozema, who is possibly best known for her 1999 risk-taking adaptation of Mansfield Park; it doesn’t quite escape its roots in experimental theatre. The story occasionally verges on self-indulgent (or rather, selves-indulgent), but it is playful and ingenious. • Mouthpiece is released on 12 March on digital platforms.	375
The Russo brothers, Anthony and Joe, have become renowned for directing the epics of the Marvel Cinematic Universe; and now they take on the big, serious, operatically painful story of Cherry, about a US army medic played by Tom Holland who leaves the service in 2007 with PTSD after witnessing horrors in Iraq. He acquires an opioid addiction that blossoms into a full-scale smack habit, miserably shared with his young wife Emily (Ciara Bravo), and finally finds a new trade in robbing banks, like a zombie wired on desperation. The Russos produce and direct, and screenwriters Angela Russo-Otstot and Jessica Goldberg have adapted the bestselling autobiographical novel by the decorated war veteran and ex-convict Nico Walker about his own desolate experiences in Civvy Street, robbing banks to feed his habit. Holland is a fierce, compact presence, his jaw muscles perennially working: he is a sweetly innocent young guy who falls for fellow college student Emily and one afternoon makes a fatally premature decision to tell her he loves her. Instead of hearing “I love you” back, Emily is scared by the gesture, pulls away from him and in angry despair at what turns out to be a temporary break-up Cherry irreversibly signs on the dotted line to join the army. Everything follows from that. The movie is divided into self-consciously weighty and epic chapters, but really it splits into two parts, war and postwar: Cherry’s military career in Iraq, in which he is both brutalised and brutalising, and then the grim nightmare of his civilian life which makes it clear that the “post” in post-traumatic stress disorder is wrong. His is a life of continuing trauma, continuing stress and continuing disorder. This is a vehement, heartfelt film that culminates in a colossally grandiose sequence with a full-scale overhead camera shot (the sort mocked in Team America: World Police) and Puccini blaring on the soundtrack. Holland certainly brings his A-game. At various times, he reminded me of Jake Gyllenhaal as the stoic grunt in Sam Mendes’s Jarhead and the smack addict Heath Ledger in Neil Armfield’s underrated heroin drama Candy. But Emily’s story is skated over and the film is rounded off a little too easily into a straightforward redemption story (its mood tacitly absorbing the happy ending of the publishing and movie deals) with no permanent price paid. There is the bleakest kind of chaotic humour in the bank robberies themselves – and it’s a reminder that apart from the Avengers movies, the Russo brothers also directed episodes of the TV comedy Arrested Development. Jack Reynor has a great supporting role as the loathsome drug dealer nicknamed Pills’n’Coke, familiarly known as “Pills”, who becomes Cherry’s longterm supplier and even his sort-of friend, although friendships are impossible in the soulless world of drug addiction. Pills finds himself being roped into being a getaway driver and then bank robber himself alongside Cherry, with terrible consequences which show us just how much Pills is really esteemed by his new non-friends. What is very interesting about the robberies here is that they show that in the moment-by-moment confrontation with the bank teller, there is a kind of negotiation, or bargaining. The teller might decide to offer a single wad of cash, but the gun-brandishing robber might angrily demand another wad before making a run for it – and all the time the clock is running down; the robber fears the police arriving and the teller fears being shot. It is a game of chicken in which the robber always loses in the end. Cherry is a fervent movie, corn-fed with drama and action, but maybe a little less than the sum of its parts. • Cherry is released on 12 March on Apple TV+.	704
Here is a documentary about the resurgent interest in retro culture that comes across like a warm fuzzy blanket of nostalgia for pre-Covid days. The central figure is “Doc” Florian Kaps, who the film presents as Vienna’s answer to Steve Jobs, a social visionary untroubled by such details as earning a living or indeed running a functioning business. Kaps’ speciality is what he calls “analogue”: physical hardware such as manual switchboards, jukeboxes, printing presses, and the like, made obsolete by the rise of laptops and smartphones. At the start of the film, Kaps’ attention is caught by the failing Polaroid camera, and – seemingly on a whim – he agrees to take over the company’s last factory, in the Netherlands. (We are not told much about his finances, other than the occasional arrival of tech investor types who pop up whenever needed.) It soon becomes clear that Kaps’ visionary utterances (“What does Facebook smell like?”) are no match for a solid business plan, and after a few years of trying fruitlessly to replicate Polaroid’s instant film, Kaps is ejected from his own company when a former intern becomes CEO after bringing in his own investor father. Kaps is not daunted after this cautionary experience, and applies his roving mind to, first, a cafe/gallery called Supersense, and later to hotel keeping; his tech contacts come in handy for the latter as he appears to get backing from Facebook’s Analog Research Lab to restart operations at a giant mothballed Overlook-type place called Sudbahnhotel. It’s never clear exactly what roles Kaps has in any of these activities, or how he earns money, but he is genial company and makes a persuasive case for life beyond the digital realm: making an astute observation that, where once analogue businesses tried to convert to digital, digital companies are now getting interested in the real world. Of course, this was all filmed pre-Covid, during which the power of digital technology has asserted itself like never before. It’s possible that Kaps’ enthusiasms may have foundered by the time the pandemic recedes. • An Impossible Project is released on 15 March on digital platforms.	418
To paraphrase Nietzsche: gaze too long into Twitter, and Twitter will gaze into you. Anyone who writes for a living on the internet has surely fantasised about payback time for all the keyboard warriors, callous below-the-liners and unrepentant trolls out there. Ivo van Aart’s movie gives full rein to that desire and is snappily directed – but in the end there is something self-satisfied and sententious about his feminist revenge flick. Katja Herbers plays Femke Boot, a newspaper columnist drowning in internet misogyny, especially after she steps out of her usual lifestyle remit to write an op-ed about Zwarte Piet, the Dutch blackface folkloric character. Her book publisher is pressurising her for juicier material to better compete with author-of-the-hour Steven Dood (Steven Death), a kohl-rimmed provocateur who savages her on a chatshow. Umbilically fed by her phone on a diet of shitposter abuse, she finally snaps when she realises her neighbour – partial to some Zwarte Piet himself – is one of her tormentors. As her serial-mom killing spree gets under way, Van Aart drapes a couple of complementary plotlines around it: her daughter Anna (Claire Porro) is fired from the school newspaper and, via the medium of F-bomb-loaded banners, fights a battle for free speech. And when Femke ends up in bed with Dood, it turns out his gothic bad boy persona is just a pose, and he is actually keeper material. These aspects hover soberly around the themes of free expression and online identities – but dilute the black comedy Van Aart attempts to operate with elsewhere. There is some nice absurdist carnage, such as middle-class mum Femke creeping along a gutter to tip a neighbour off the roof in her inaugural murder. But the humour isn’t sharpened to a fine point, leaving each new death to bludgeon in The Columnist’s thesis with the blunt end: online life has robbed us of the ability to appreciate nuance and difference. Femke’s graduation to monster lacks the delicious irony it’s shooting for, as a few plot-logic slips en route – why leave uncleaned weapons around for others to discover? – betray Van Aart’s haste to get his opinion out there. • The Columnist is released on 12 March on digital platforms.	419
There is something visionary about this near-nonsensical, kitsch but atmospheric techno-thriller from Canadian director Anthony Scott Burns. Drawn along on dark somnambulic rhythms, it incorporates elements of fantasy, horror and 80s synthwave aesthetics without giving itself over completely to any of them. A wordless first 10 minutes introduces us to Sarah (Julia Sarah Stone), a runaway student apparently unwelcome or unwilling to return home, waking in spectrally lit parks and falling asleep in coffee shops. Dropping suddenly into surrealistic CGI dreams that track inexorably towards a demonic figure who, if approached too closely, wakes her with a start. Sarah decides to try to climb out of this insomniac bath by enrolling in a university sleep study. It is overseen by Dr Meyer, a Cronenbergian academic in big glasses, but run by a trio of researchers who, like the memory technicians in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, have a loose relationship with scientific protocol. Becoming close to Jeremy (Landon Liboiron), she learns that they are using pioneering technology to observe the subjects’ dreams – and that the same shadowy presence manifests in all of them. But Burns doesn’t pursue this supernatural lead where you would expect, committing instead to a dream-logic that mostly abrogates him of plot duties. Acting as his own cinematographer and editor, he puts together a blow-out of imagery with great technical skill that fleshes out this waking dream of a film. Sarah watches her dream self in Jeremy’s mind’s eye on the monochrome monitors, which later melds into a stylised aquamarine-flooded sex scene that is like a Michael Mann wet dream (a debt acknowledged by the use of Shriekback’s Coelacanth, the spine-chilling tune from Manhunter). Talking is beside the point – and, with Stone adept at mute trepidation, it often feels that way even when there is some dialogue. As for interpreting what it all means, leave that to Burns’s therapist. The flamboyance on display here, though, promises great things. • Come True is released on 15 March on digital platforms.	387
There’s a self-serious portent to the drab serial killer thriller The Little Things, a smug sense of grandiosity informing us that it’s not only more substantial than the average stalk-n-stab schlock, but that it’s going somewhere we might not expect, ending with gravity rather than gristle. To its credit, the film, from The Blind Side writer-director John Lee Hancock, does find itself in slightly unconventional territory in its rushed finale but it’s not a place that’s either satisfying or smart enough to warrant the hushed solemnity that precedes it. It’s a film trapped between a low- and a highbrow version of a story we know all too well, landing firmly in the middle of the road. With elements of Seven and Zodiac in the mix, arguably the film it most resembles is Insomnia, both the Norwegian original and Christopher Nolan’s excellent remake, its very title recalling a key recurring line about focusing on the small things during an investigation (Hancock insists any comparisons are coincidental with the first draft of the script written back in 1993). In what feels like an adaptation of a potboiler but is actually an original story, deputy sheriff “Deke” (Denzel Washington) finds himself unavoidably dragged back into the thrust of a case he’s not supposed to be involved in (after an admittedly effective Silence of the Lambs-esque cold open). Once a celebrated member of the force, with age he’s found himself pushed to the back, lumped with grunt work over anything more rewarding. But when another young woman is murdered, he’s unable to resist, much to the chagrin of Jimmy (Rami Malek), the point guy on the case. The story also interweaves with an unsolved case from Deke’s past as well as a local stranger (Jared Leto) who may or may not be involved. Maybe if Hancock’s film had been produced back in the early 90s, it would have at least felt like a more admirably serious-minded riposte to a sub-genre that often devolves into silliness. But at a time when even small-screen procedurals have perma-frowned detectives who spend more time haunted by their past than actually solving crimes in the present, it all feels a little too familiar and a little too minor. As a slow, meditative character-driven drama, it’s too shallow and as a dark, disturbing serial killer thriller, it’s too boring and so quite who this film is for remains a bigger mystery than the one at its centre. As probably the most reliable leading man currently working in Hollywood, Washington can put a shine on even the dullest of material and while he’s no doubt stretched here, he avoids a mere sleepwalk and singlehandedly helps muster up just enough interest to drag us through. His character is mostly standard issue, but it’s a sturdy, accomplished turn, the kind that only he can do quite this well, yet his other two Oscar-winning co-stars struggle. Playing a dogged LAPD detective with the same otherworldly strangeness that won him plaudits for Mr Robot and Bohemian Rhapsody (and makes him a perfect choice for a Bond villain), Malek is awkwardly ill-suited for the role, a performance so discordant, it makes one question the actor’s long-term versatility and just how Hollywood will best make use of him. While Leto certainly looks the part of “potential killer of women” with his pale sunken skin and greasy long hair, his line delivery is so embarrassingly unsubtle that he might as well have walked off the set of a Hammer horror parody, never convincing us that he’s playing anything other than an Evil Movie Villain. That juicy killer-cop interplay, the spiky cat and mouse game that drives films such as this, just isn’t really there, Hancock struggling to differentiate his film from the many others that have come before, as admirably hard as Washington tries. That aforementioned ending, while theoretically interesting, just doesn’t land with the impact Hancock seems to think it does, a big swing that misses. Part of me admires him for it, but it’s such an empty coda presented with such weight, urging us to take what’s mostly a rather rote serial killer movie with awards-worthy seriousness, that it ultimately annoys (what it says about cops is also rather uneasy at this, or frankly any, moment). There are little things here that work but the big problems are impossible to ignore. The Little Things is released on HBO Max and in cinemas in the US on 29 January and in the UK on 12 February	875
People in the entertainment industry sometimes speak about performers having the “it” factor – a difficult to define quality not necessarily apparent in real life, but ushered into shimmering existence on stage or screen. Nobody in the world has ever had “it” quite like the great Yolŋu actor David Gulpilil, a titanic force in Australian cinema and now the subject of director Molly Reynolds’ superb, sad, yet in its own way wonder-filled documentary, which achieves the intimidating task of doing justice to the life and career of this extraordinary artist. Reynolds understands that Gulpilil isn’t just a great actor but a portal to a different way of thinking, a different way of being, even a different state of consciousness. If you think that sounds like hyperbole, you have not seen a David Gulpilil movie. Plenty are sampled in My Name Is Gulpilil, which oscillates between present and past, drawing on portrayals plucked from the actor’s rich oeuvre to illustrate different parts of his life and character – his story, this time, not someone else’s. Moments from his films (so smoothly integrated by editor Tania M. Nehme) feature like personal footprints, snapshots of a life impressed on to celluloid. The film plays out in the spirit of a living wake, celebrating its subject while contemplating the inevitable. One Buñuelian shot captures the actor from above, lying with his eyes closed in a coffin with red lining, his body covered in old film reels. They flow out of it, as if they are a natural part of the man himself. In a sense, of course, they are. Gulpilil has been present on our screens for a full half century, his career beginning with a breakthrough performance in Nicolas Roeg’s great 1971 film Walkabout. Back then Gulpilil was a teenager with a cheeky gleam in his eyes – now, in his 60s with lung cancer, his spirit and humour are still apparent but those eyes have dimmed. Living in Murray Bridge, South Australia with his carer Mary, who he says will be “with me until I’m gone”, we see Gulpilil take pills – including for pain management and anxiety – and puff on an inhaler. Throughout the course of the running time he philosophises on differences in attitudes towards medicine in white and Indigenous cultures, the former involving its determination to “win” – to “beat” or “conquer” illness. But Gulpilil is under no illusions about his own situation, declaring he is going “back to country on a one-way ticket”. He introduces the film as “my story of my story”, implying dual layers: his life and his life in film. There have been other nonfiction productions about or involving the actor, including Bill Leimbach’s 48-minute documentary Walkabout to Hollywood, from 1980, which contains interesting footage revealing Gulpilil’s intellect and personality as a (much younger) artist. And another directed by Reynolds – 2015’s excellent Another Country, an essay-like analysis of Gulpilil’s then home town of Ramingining in the Northern Territory, which uses the location as a case study to explore incompatible aspects of white and Indigenous Australian cultures. But My Name Is Gulpilil is on another level: so sublimely made, so humane, so elegant in construction. Among other things, it is a reflection on mortality and an acknowledgment of the movie medium as a form of mausoleum, fossilising (though the great director Andrei Tarkovsky preferred to call this “sculpting”) moments in time, and here, bringing them back, for a story of a story. Several moments show Gulpilil walking towards the camera, or walking away. Sometimes he does this in the same shot. Always these moments crystallise a subtextual message about looking forward and looking backwards. The director does so without turning a blind eye to her subject’s shortcomings; in one scene Gulpilil stands alone in a hospital or medical centre corridor, as we hear audio snippets from news bulletins reporting on controversies and criminal charges he faced over years – like grim memories tumbling around his psyche. Seeing present-day Gulpilil on a boat evokes memories of films that position him close to water, geographically and spiritually. Among them, the creature feature Dark Age, about the pursuit of a “dreaming croc”, Peter Weir’s end-times drama The Last Wave, the final moments of Goldstone, which present Gulpilil as a kind of whispered memory in the mind of Aaron Pedersen, and those sublime coastal scenes from the original Storm Boy. Elsewhere in the documentary, in a personal reflection from the man himself, we learn that “Gulpilil” means “Kingfisher”. And so, all those scenes next to water retrospectively acquire an almost cosmic sense of purpose, as if positioning the great actor near creeks, rivers, oceans was preordained. Pensive and piercingly emotional, this is an unforgettable film.	928
If there was anything guaranteed to rile the anti-woke brigade, it ought to be the news that Superman could soon be black on the big screen, just as a woman takes on the mantle of Thor. And yet, what’s that we hear rumbling through the cosmos like space tumbleweed, but the sound of (relative) silence? Apart from a few minor Twitter grumbles when it was announced at Comic-Con 2019 that Natalie Portman was to take on the role of Marvel’s thunder god, there has been very little in the way of backlash – certainly nothing like the horrible behaviour dished out to Kelly Marie Tran for daring to sign up to Star Wars, or to Leslie Jones for appearing in the all-female Ghostbusters remake. Nor have the trolls really begun to target reports that acclaimed essayist and novelist Ta-Nehisi Coates will pen a new film about the man of steel for Warner Bros that is expected to feature a black version of Kal-El. That movie is being produced (and possibly directed) by JJ Abrams, though there are rumours the studio might be looking for a black director, too. With publicity beginning to ramp up for next year’s Thor: Love &amp; Thunder, there’s still time for negativity to surface, as the trolls get their teeth into Warner Bros’s film. But right now, it seems there’s only positivity flowing around both projects. Love &amp; Thunder will once again be directed by Taika Waititi, who did such an excellent job with Thor: Ragnarok. And the reality is that Thor has always been more interesting on the big screen when he’s been out of sorts. The best moments in Kenneth Branagh’s underrated original 2011 movie are those in which the arrogant young Thor gets cast out of Asgard by a beardy Anthony Hopkins to learn humility and the true meaning of heroism as an Earthbound mortal. He’s also brilliant as a beer-gutted drunk in Avengers: Endgame. You can imagine the Marvel bods, while trying to dream up Thor’s next adventure, seizing upon the recent comic book run in which Jane Foster becomes Thor as the perfect way to move the character on and avoid him reverting to the tedious cosmic princeling of Thor: The Dark World. It also helps when you have an actor of the calibre of Portman available. The black Superman concept – Michael B Jordan is a hot tip to star – also boasts a what’s-not-to-like quality, especially if Warner Bros hires a director of colour. Coates boasts that rare combination of intellectual clout and geeky cool, as both the recipient of a 2015 “genius” grant from the MacArthur foundation and a writer of Black Panther and Captain America comics for Marvel. The idea of a writer who specialises in examining both the African American experience and the evil legacy of white supremacy working on a superhero whose mantra is “truth, justice and the American way” almost blows the mind. How would Kal-El’s perspective on humanity shift if he found himself viewed through a racist prism of fear and suspicion by some of the very people he came all the way across the galaxy to help? At the very least, we can be sure he would spend a lot less time trying to date Lois and saving imperilled cats. The fact that movies like these are being met with enthusiasm should not signal that the dark side of the internet is dwindling. After all, we don’t have to look too far back to find a time when blatant racism was something to be brushed under the carpet, rather than publicly called out. Only this week, Harry Potter star Katie Leung revealed that she faced online abuse after her role as Cho Chang was announced over a decade ago, even stumbling upon a “hate site” directed at her. Leung told the Chinese Chippy Girl podcast she was told by publicists to deny the attacks were happening. It would be nice to think that Leung’s appearance as Potter’s romantic interest helped boost the multicultural makeup of the world’s fifth highest-grossing film franchise of all time. But it’s also worth bearing in mind that if those movies had been made a decade later, an actor of colour might easily have been cast as one of the film’s leads. That’s a cultural shift that’s already begun in superhero movies. When dealt with intelligently and creatively, shifts in the makeup of decades-old costumed crimefighters have only proved to make them more intriguing. Without the introduction of Miles Morales we would never have born witness to the Oscar-winning, psychedelic joy that was Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Few would argue that Samuel L Jackson makes a better Nick Fury than David Hasselhoff. Will Thor: Love &amp; Thunder and the black Superman movie end up helping to change racist and sexist attitudes? It would be nice to think so. Will they be more intriguing than the films that might otherwise have been made? Almost certainly.	945
Ex-con Schillinger (Ryan Francis) has been out of the big house long enough to start up his own business as a removal man, and has just hired two more employees, also prison alumni: tough Imani (Morgan Alexandria) and her friend, soft-spoken new father Carlos (Bryce Fernelius). All three have pasts they would like to put in the rear-view mirror of the moving van. But an offer from a creepy old man (Michael Flynn) with a German accent to do a quick overnight cash job will expose each person’s dark secrets and vulnerabilities, including piquing their perfectly natural curiosity when he tells them to shift everything in the mansion but stay out, per the title, of the attic. And the basement for that matter, but presumably director Jerren Lauder and his producers agreed Stay Out of the F**king Attic and Also the Basement wasn’t such a snappy title. Of course, the employer’s command sets the movers in motion and it all comes out: Nazi pasts, monsters, and one unfortunate mover’s eyeball in a particularly gruesome interlude. Strictly in terms of generating jumpscares and gross-out moments this is efficient enough as a cinematic machine, but the script credited to four different people including Lauder hasn’t got a lot of finesse or subtlety. Even for allowing that horror films set in spooky old houses are supposed to be full of dark shadows and blackness, this is especially gloomily lit, so viewing on laptops is not recommended. Tension relieving laughs are few and far between, except for unintended guffaws that might be generated when one character skins part of their own anatomy; but the actor does such a poor job of expressing pain it looks like they merely stubbed their toe. • Stay Out of the F**king Attic is released on 11 March on Shudder.	351
Broken into arch chapter headings that are introduced with intricate, stylised illustrations like something out of a book of fairytales for Gen Z and millennial misfits, this fey, magical realism fable is an interesting mixture of winning charm, smug knowingness and vulnerability. The screenwriter (Olivia Dufault), one of the young co-stars (Sophie Giannamore from Transparent) and the character she plays are all transgender, and the film is at its best when it is working through issues around dysphoria through the lens of allegory. That feeling of not being at ease in your own body is at the heart of this story about a 13-year-old named Paul (Jaeden Martell, heartbreakingly expressive even under a ton of prosthetics and fake hair) who has a condition that causes him to grow lustrous golden-red fur all over his body, including his face. Teased by peers at school, and already dealing with major abandonment issues after his mother ran off when he was little, he can’t even count on his well-meaning but clueless dad (Chris Messina) to do the right thing. One day Paul runs off to find his mother in that mythical land known as Pennsylvania. Along the way, he briefly becomes a freak show attraction at a carnival run by the menacing if mesmerising Mr Silk (John Turturro, going over the top, round the outside and up from underneath with an outrageously hammy performance); and then falls in love with a beautiful singer around his own age named Aristiana (Giannamore), whose dreary mother insists on calling her by her dead name “Kevin”. First time director Martin Krejci draws lovely performances from his cast, and the whole thing looks dreamy and splendid thanks to Andrew Droz Palermo’s cinematography – but the last act could have done with some serious workshopping to smooth out the motivational kinks and deflationary resolution. Still, it might be the kind of film a kid wrestling with their identity will treasure forever, flaws and all. • The Adventures of Wolfboy is released on 15 March on digital platforms.	383
The sad, shifty and inglorious business of government informants working inside radical protest groups is something that usually takes years to come out – if at all – because nobody wants to talk about it. Governments don’t want to gloat because it might mean admitting they knew all about certain events or attacks in advance but did nothing because they wanted to keep their asset in place to forestall some bigger situation. And the protest groups are angry and ashamed at the infiltration. And something desolate attaches to the long-term snitches themselves, who look horribly dysfunctional, like bigamists revealed to have a second wife and family. Sam Pollard’s documentary MLK/FBI touched briefly on the supposedly loyal insiders within Martin Luther King’s organisation who were secretly reporting to J Edgar Hoover – a subject so painful that it can still hardly be discussed. Now there is this fiercely watchable and passionately performed drama from the director Shaka King, with barnstorming performances from Lakeith Stanfield and Daniel Kaluuya – about the Chicago Black Panther leader Fred Hampton who in 1969, at the age of 21, was cold-bloodedly shot at home during a raid by the FBI. The Bureau had been given inside information about the layout of his apartment by their snitch: Hampton’s trusted security chief William O’Neal, a former petty criminal who had been arrested and “turned” by the FBI man Roy Mitchell four years previously, and then instructed to rise up through the Black Panther ranks. O’Neal had also drugged Hampton’s drink so that he would be asleep or bleary during the raid and unable to escape. O’Neal might be nothing more than a footnote, but this drama shrewdly and fascinatingly elevates him to equal status with Hampton – a diptych of tragic irony, the Judas to Hampton’s messiah, a guy who had come up from the same streets as Hampton and might, if things had been different, had the same vocation. Daniel Kaluuya is Hampton himself, a little bulked up, and superbly conveying the muscular force of his charisma, his rhetoric and his instinctive leadership, and he brilliantly turns on the death-ray of Hampton’s basilisk stare. And Stanfield gives us a career-best performance as poor William O’Neal, wonderfully cast as the ordinary guy who gets in over his head: Stanfield’s gentle face, often breaking into a slippery but charming smile, is enough to break your heart. Dominique Fishback is surely in line for a best supporting actress Oscar, with her sensitive, sympathetic performance as Fred’s partner Deborah Johnson. Jesse Plemons is Roy Mitchell, the Bureau man “running” O’Neal and Martin Sheen has a returning cameo in heavy facial prosthetic as the creepy J Edgar himself. But what a high-octane charge of excitement Kaluuya and Stanfield bring to the screen simply by showing up. There is something mesmeric about the way Hampton, with an almost Napoleonic confidence, faces everyone down with his searching gaze, and yet is boyishly shy with Deborah, and Fishback’s contribution is so important for giving the audience access to the drama. As for Stanfield, he makes O’Neal seem sympathetic or even romantic in his patently doomed career of treason: visibly thrilled to be taken out by Mitchell for a lavish steak-house lunch on the Bureau’s tab or invited to Mitchell’s house and allowed to drink his scotch; never in denial exactly, in fact excruciatingly aware of the danger, but never facing up to what he is doing. Yet the inevitable, terrible moment comes during a meal at Hampton’s house – the last supper. Somehow, the Judas figure seems as important, almost more important than the Messiah: I found myself thinking of the Borges story, Three Versions Of Judas, in which Judas’s destiny and significance is terrifyingly revealed to be much greater than anyone imagined. Like many biopics, this ends with a postscript – three or four stark sentences about the historical facts. It’s a cliche, but Shaka King does something very unexpected with it: he begins with Lakeith Stanfield playing the older O’Neal giving a TV interview in 1990 about his life, and ends with the real O’Neal saying the same words – but there is a vicious sting in the tail. It’s a powerful tale of human frailty. Out now on digital formats, and in cinemas in Australia. • This article was amended on 2 February 2021 to remove a reference suggesting that Hampton had not held meetings with working-class white groups.	857
Matthew McConaughey has announced he is “seriously considering” a run for Texas governor, a year before the state election. The actor revealed his intention on a recent episode of Crime Stoppers of Houston’s The Balanced Voice podcast on Wednesday. He told the host, Rania Mankarious, that running for governor was a “true consideration”. “I’m looking into now again, what is my leadership role?” he said. “Because I do think I have some things to teach and share, and what is my role? What’s my category in my next chapter of life that I’m going into?” If McConaughey launches a gubernatorial campaign, he will face Greg Abbott, a Republican who is up for re-election. This isn’t the first time the 51-year-old Oscar winner has hinted at the idea. When asked in November 2020 by the conservative talk radio host Hugh Hewitt whether he would consider a bid, he responded, “It would be up to the people more than it would me.” He called politics a “broken business” and said it would only garner more interest when it “redefines its purpose”. McConaughey’s political affiliation is unknown, and many online are speculating whether he would run as a Republican or Democrat. While there is no clear indication of which side he falls on, his past comments on hot-button issues such as gun violence, masks and defunding the police can offer some clarity. In October, McConaughey was invited on the Joe Rogan Experience, the popular podcast, where he discussed topics including being a Christian in Hollywood and defunding the police. He said some Hollywood liberals went too far left. Discussing his religion, he said: “Some people in our industry, not all of them, there’s some that go to the left so far … that go to the illiberal left side so far, that is so condescending and patronizing to 50% of the world that need the empathy that the liberals have … To illegitimize them because they say they are a believer is just so arrogant, and in some ways hypocritical, to me.” When asked about defunding the police, McConaughey gave a careful response on how he would attempt to improve relations between police and the community. “It’s almost like it should have been renamed because ‘defund’ does not sound anything like there’s been money reallocated to different areas of handling some police exercise,” he said. “The community and the police need to get back together, and the community needs to say, ‘Here’s what’s unfair. Here’s how I feel it’s unfair as a Black man or a person of color or whatever the situation. Here’s my problem with my relationship with you as cops,” he continued. McConaughey said his life practice was to meet in the middle and compromise, which is clear on his other political stances. “The two sides got to talk,” he said on the press tour for the film White Boy Rick. “Hey, where can we reach across the aisle here? Find a compromise for the betterment of all of us?” The actor spoke out on the “epidemic” of gun violence in 2018, taking a different stance from his more progressive colleagues. He showed concern that the March for Our Lives, organized after the Parkland high school shooting, would be “hijacked” by some anti-gun movement, saying that the march was for “rightful, just and responsible gun ownership – but against assault rifles, against unlimited magazines and for following up on the regulations”. Early in the pandemic, McConaughey filmed pro-mask PSAs and interviewed Dr Anthony Fauci on Instagram. In an interview with Jesse Will for Men’s Journal, he lamented how politicized mask-wearing had been by both sides of the spectrum. “It became apparent that there was no plan. Our leaders were scrambling,” he said. In the same interview, he touched on the possible message of a hypothetical campaign – not the “Make America all right, all right, all right again” many of his fans joked about, but a more serious “meet me in the middle – I dare you”. The message follows the same philosophy as his bestselling autobiography, Greenlights: “When facing any crisis, I’ve found that a good plan is to first recognize the problem, then stabilize the situation, organize the response, then respond.” Regardless of his political affiliation, McConaughey’s love for the Lone Star state is evident in his many philanthropic projects through his foundation, the Just Keep Livin’ Organization. When his home state was hit with a severe winter storm in February, McConaughey hosted a virtual benefit through his foundation to provide Texans with the “bare necessities”.	921
If it didn’t plod quite so tamely in the footsteps of films such as Seven and Zodiac; if Rami Malek had chosen to use more than one facial expression in his performance, then perhaps this overly familiar tale of obsessed cops and serial killers might feel less stale. As it is, it’s about as fresh as a bloated, bile-tinged corpse dredged from the Los Angeles river, with a markedly similar colour palette to boot. As deputy sheriff Joe Deacon, Denzel Washington’s shuffling gait and round shoulders belie a sharp mind that is wasted in the quiet backwater where he now works. Sent to LA, his old stomping ground, Joe is confronted by former colleagues less than thrilled to see him, and by his successor Jim Baxter (Malek), who is about as wholesome as it’s possible to be in a job that involves scrutinising corpses on a daily basis. Initial hostility warms into mutual respect, as the two men bond over the investigation of a series of murders. John Lee Hancock, who wrote as well as directed the film, is no David Fincher, but his use of colour is bold: green is threaded through The Little Things like a trail of clues – the eyes of a victim, the pistachio paintwork of a suspect’s car, the throbbing emerald of Joe’s hotel room breakdown. But as the detectives start to lose the plot, so does the film, fizzling into an unravelling tangle of loose ends. • On multiple VOD platforms	288
Netflix is forecast to lose its crown as the world’s biggest video streaming provider within three years, amid explosive growth at Disney after the launch of its rival on-demand service only 16 months ago. The Walt Disney Company announced earlier this month that its flagship Disney+ platform, launched in late 2019, had passed 100 million global subscribers – a feat that took its arch-rival, Netflix, a decade to achieve. Taken together with subscriber numbers for the group’s ESPN+ sports platform and Hulu subscription service in the US, the surge puts Disney on track to dethrone Netflix by 2024. The Mandalorian-driven success story has smashed the expectations of management, which had conservatively estimated it would take five years to reach 90 million subscribers. In December, an emboldened Disney tripled its target to 260 million by 2024 and doubled its content budget to $15bn (£10.8bn), underscoring its position as the third major force in the global streaming wars. Last month, Netflix announced it had 203.7 million subscribers, taking four years to notch up its second hundred million, while Amazon Prime Video – home to series such as Outlander and The Marvelous Mrs Maisel, as well as sport including Premier League football and NFL – is estimated to have about 147 million regular global users. “Disney+ has obviously experienced some of the fastest growth seen from a subscription video-on-demand service; kudos to them for establishing themselves as a global force so fast,” said Richard Broughton, an analyst at Ampere Analysis. “While Disney+ is still only half the size of Netflix, it has reached that milestone in an unprecedented timescale.” Ampere said Disney+ would overtake Amazon Prime Video in 2024 to become the world’s second most popular streaming service. Netflix would remain on top until at least 2025, when he forecasts subscriber numbers would hit 247 million and 286 million respectively. However, taking into account ESPN+ and Hulu, the Walt Disney Company overall would pull ahead of Netflix in two or three years’ time. The group is forecast to hit 266 million subscribers by the end of 2023, just shy of Netflix on 269 million. A year later, the positions will be reversed, with Netflix’s 279 million subscribers trailing Walt Disney’s 295 million. With Britons spending 40% of their waking hours in front of the TV during the height of the coronavirus pandemic, streaming services have experienced a boom in popularity. By the end of last year, more than 32 million Britons had become subscribers to Netflix, Amazon or Disney+, double the number signed up to traditional pay-TV providers such as Sky, BT and Virgin Media. While Netflix enjoyed a record year on a global scale, the addition of 37 million new subscribers is the most in a single year in its history, Disney+ proved to be the biggest winner in the UK. Helped by the serendipitous timing of its UK launch – in the week the nation entered the first lockdown in March 2020 – Disney+ hoovered up almost 40% of the 13 million new streaming subscribers in the UK last year. Amazon Prime Video took a quarter, while Netflix, the most popular service in the UK, attracted 19%, according to the data firm Kantar. On the face of it, the level of success Disney+ has achieved could be surprising, given the relatively slim catalogue of content it launched with compared with its rivals. As of January this year, Disney+ offered 4,500 hours of content compared with 40,000 on Netflix and 50,000 on Amazon. Even relative minnows such as BritBox (10,000 hours) and Hayu, home to reality shows such as Below Deck and Keeping up with the Kardashians, (6,000), offered more. Disney is aware of the need for a steady pipeline of new TV programmes and films in the content arms race to attract and keep subscribers. It has a target of adding more than 100 new titles to the service each year. In addition, it launched a global companion streaming service, Star, last month – doubling the amount of content it offers with programmes designed to appeal to a wider non-Disney audience, such as Lost, Desperate Housewives, 24 and The X-Files. “It is about quality over quantity,” Broughton said. “The others have volume, Disney relies on the quality of its brands. It has shows and films that people, fans, feel they must watch.”	826
Following the death of her mother, Cass is falling to pieces – a fact that this adaptation of an inventive stage play explores through the device of having two actors simultaneously playing the same character. Norah Sadava and Amy Nostbakken wrote the play and jointly star as Cass; Nostbakken also contributes the film’s haunting and rather lovely score. I wonder if the dual performance might have had a more forceful impact in the stage incarnation; nevertheless, the film is undeniably potent in its account of the shattering force of grief.

In the right hands, storytelling within a framework of restrictions can lead to thrillingly inventive film-making – think the Dogme films, with their vow of creative chastity, or single-location thrillers such as Gustav Möller’s The Guilty or Steven Knight’s Locke. Knight wrote the screenplay for this Covid-19 drama, but the tale of a struggling marriage – Anne Hathaway and Chiwetel Ejiofor are suitably mismatched – pushed to breaking point by the first pandemic lockdown is worlds away from the lean cinema of limitation of Locke. Instead, the film busts a gut attempting to free itself from the confines of the couple’s home. In this, it’s at least true to the spirit of lockdown, but it feels like a missed opportunity. • Available on multiple VOD platforms	145
The fashion story behind the Oscar-nominated 2021 movie Judas and the Black Messiah, which details the final months of the Black Panther Fred Hampton’s life in 1969 before he was betrayed by William O’Neal, an FBI informant, isn’t just one about the Black Panthers’ uniform of leather jacket and beret. It’s also about natural hair. The seeds of the natural hair movement and the anti-discrimination Crown act (Tucson, Arizona, became the latest city to adopt the law last week) were sown by the Black Panthers, the film’s hair stylist told the Guardian. “[They] were saying ‘no’ through [their] hair,” says Rebecca Woodfork, who also worked on Marvel’s Black Panther. “The breakaway from harsh chemicals [to] embracing the natural texture of black hair was much deeper than a breakup from a partner. For black American revolutionaries, such as the Black Panthers, it was a breakup from America.” She says that it was a new chapter of a hair journey that had been weaponised since the beginning of slavery. The Black Panthers subverted the expectations placed on black hair. “During this time the relaxers and chemicals that did not celebrate our natural hair textures were no longer going to be the status quo,” Woodfork says. “Making this statement was empowering and defied the demands put upon people of color in America.” But it was also met with prejudice and “the assumption that you were unkempt, not professional, ‘too black’ and of lesser value to the social system”, she says. These prejudices still exist today: 93% of black people have experienced microaggressions in relation to their hair. The Black Panthers’ aesthetic is displayed on screen. The sleek, anti-establishment look was itself a reaction to the formal look of the previous era of civil rights, embodied by Martin Luther King, which was seen as “bourgeois” by the younger radicals. “Just as Black Power was a more assertive type of anti-race movement started by people who were disillusioned with the earlier civil rights movements, their clothes were also a more assertive statement,” says Richard Thompson Ford, author of Dress Codes. “[It was] a rejection of what they saw as the ‘accommodationist’ style of the Martin Luther King Jr generation.” The look chimed with that of the 60s youth culture and doubled as a form of sartorial protection. “The origins of the Panther uniform was to conceal identities,” says Charlese Antoinette, costume director for Judas and the Black Messiah. “They used items that were readily available: sunglasses and leather jackets. In the case of the Illinois party, they wore a lot of camo jackets in protests of the draft and the Vietnam war.” Items of concealment also included the beret, which became a signature part of the Panther uniform. “According to [the Black Panthers co-founder] Huey P Newton, it was the international symbol of revolutionaries,” Antoinette says. Elements of the look are still being used today to semaphore black power, from the cover of British Vogue’s September issue to Beyoncé’s 2016 Super Bowl performance, and Antoinette believes the look has stood the test of time because of “its sleek, clean, minimal silhouettes” and the fact that it consists of items that are easily found. “Transforming these everyday items into political statements also reminds me of this quote by Huey P Newton,” she says: “‘Power is the ability to define phenomena and make it act in a desired manner.’”	683
In the Oscar-tipped current release The United States vs Billie Holiday, a federal agent with deeply divided loyalties is dispatched to infiltrate and undermine a powerful voice of civil rights. That scenario is echoed in this superior “Inspired By True Events” drama from director and co-writer Shaka King, in which Lakeith Stanfield plays a petty car thief strong-armed into spying on prominent Black Panther leader Fred Hampton, charismatically portrayed by dead-cert Oscar contender Daniel Kaluuya. “A badge is scarier than a gun,” explains William O’Neal (Stanfield) when he’s arrested for impersonating an FBI agent to steal a flashy ride. “It’s like you got a whole damn army behind you.” Instead, he now has agent Roy Mitchell (Jesse Plemons) on his case, offering him a choice between several years in prison or becoming an informant. At the specific instruction of J Edgar Hoover (Martin Sheen, sporting Dracula-like makeup), the bureau has set its sights on Hampton, who is forging allegiances with a rainbow coalition of partners (“rednecks and Puerto Ricans!”) as the Panthers’ influence expands. With no avowed political beliefs beyond self-preservation, O’Neal seems the perfect tool to wrangle his way into the party and report on its inner workings. As he rises within the ranks, becoming security captain of the local Illinois chapter and bodyguard to Hampton, Hoover wants to use him “more creatively”. Yet O’Neal’s own affiliations are becoming ever more blurred, with his fears of being revealed as an informer intertwined with what appears to be a growing sympathy for Hampton’s revolutionary proclamations. As Mitchell observes after watching O’Neal at a fiery Panthers meeting: “Either this guy deserves an Academy Award or he believes this shit.” Just how much the real-life O’Neal bought into the Panthers’ rhetoric remains a matter of debate. Watching the full unedited footage of his 1989 interview for the PBS documentary Eyes on the Prize II (fragments of which are restaged) it’s clear that he liked and admired Hampton and felt both “bad” and “betrayed” by his role in his downfall. Yet he also looked up to Mitchell, whom he called a “role model”, and was enamoured of the FBI, which he viewed as entirely distinct from the vicious Chicago Police. It’s a credit to Stanfield that he manages to keep these complex contradictions alive throughout his performance, capturing perfectly the uneasy manner that O’Neal exhibited on camera, his eyes darting anxiously as he attempts to read his surroundings, his manner a mix of fearful, furtive and oddly forceful. By contrast, Kaluuya’s Hampton is steadfast and determined; inspirational in public, unexpectedly shy in person. Physically bulked up but often softly spoken, he’s a fully rounded character into whom Kaluuya injects empathy and a touch of magic. No wonder O’Neal is so taken with him, even when the Panthers’ Maoist teachings leave him cold. For all of Hampton’s incendiary speeches about killing “pigs” and dying for the revolution (Mitchell calls the Panthers and the Klan two sides of the same coin), it’s the free breakfasts for kids and healthcare programmes for the community that inspire the “poet” in Kaluuya’s character. There are echoes of the tenderness of If Beale Street Could Talk in the growing relationship between Fred and Deborah Johnson, played with guileless warmth by Bafta-nominee Dominique Fishback. Craig Harris and Mark Isham work in musical harmony with Sean Bobbitt’s gorgeous cinematography, providing suspicious melancholy chords, angular percussion and prowling double bass riffs that intertwine with the action. Meanwhile, Sam Lisenco, Jeremy Woolsey and Rebecca Brown ensure that the production design draws us deep into the period setting. It all adds up to a gripping drama that intersects fleetingly with that overpraised awards favourite The Trial of the Chicago 7 (in the sketched spectre of a bound Bobby Seale, the Black Panther co-founder), but feels altogether more substantial and satisfying. • Judas and the Black Messiah is on streaming services	778
Eight months after his relationship with not-quite-stepdaughter Soon-Yi was revealed in 1992, Woody Allen was accused of sexually abusing Dylan Farrow, his younger daughter with his partner Mia Farrow, when she was seven. Allen strongly denied all the allegations, as he has continued to do over the nearly 30 years since. But they fell on fertile soil. How could a man who could start an affair with his partner’s daughter not be capable of just about anything else, the argument went? A welter of publicity followed, claims (that no mother, especially one as devoted as Farrow, could possibly make such a thing up), counterclaims (that in fact she had done so, that Dylan was coached – which she denies, and that it was all an act of vengeance for the Soon-Yi affair), along with gossip and hearsay proliferated. Dylan and her brother Ronan Farrow began speaking about the matter publicly themselves in 2014. This has disinterred old battle lines and occasioned new accounts from people who were close to the family at the time and from Moses, another of the Farrow children, which contradict either things they said at the time or the saintly mother narrative that seemed the most natural one. Meanwhile, doctors examined Dylan at the time and found no evidence to support Farrow’s contention, and Allen was investigated by the Yale New Haven hospital’s child sexual abuse clinic and the New York State’s social services department, who reached similar conclusions. Journalism’s job, the truism goes, is not to hear from each side what they think the weather’s like but to stick your head out of the window and see if it’s raining. The new HBO documentary Allen v Farrow (Sky Documentaries) has a running length of four hours, which would be ample time to do so. Alas, though, the film attempts to be an investigation, we do not hear from both sides and are working with the curtains very firmly shut. It is the Farrows’ show throughout. Dylan, Ronan and, above, all Mia lay out their version of events without any interruption other than footage of home videos, interior shots of the beautiful Connecticut home at which the ugliest of events is alleged to have happened and selected clips of Allen in chatshow interviews going back decades. Occasionally, we hear excerpts read out from his autobiography published last year, but it’s hard to feel that this constitutes a proper response given Allen declined to take part. Which makes it what? A four-hour PR piece, at one level, another front opening up in the continuing battle to establish which asserted truth wins public hearts and minds – all the victory, in the absence of a trial, that is left. At another level, though it doesn’t ape the style of the true crime genre that has flourished since Making a Murderer became such a hit for Netflix, it feeds those same appetites. It leaves itself open to the same charges of pandering to an audience’s worst appetites and exploiting some or all of those who take part. And while the first-tier contributors to this genre reinvestigate, adduce new evidence and/or bring to light miscarriages of justice, Allen v Farrow is in the second class – which simply re-expose and pick over the bones of what went before. I am not passing comment on the rights and wrongs or facts or fictions of the situation – I have, after all, like all but a small handful of people in the world, no idea of the truth. But that’s really the point. If you are going to present four hours of information on a contentious subject, you need to add value to it, stress-test it, go deeper, not simply regurgitate what one party has told you – however much sympathy you feel for them, however much you believe them. Especially then, in fact, because a wholly uncritical, uninterrogated presentation eventually allows the suspicion that the story couldn’t withstand it. In the first episode you might point as an example of this to the moment when Mia Farrow lists how much predatory behaviour she claims she saw from Allen, and yet is not pressed on why then she did not act as we might expect. And so another layer of doubt and obfuscation accretes around a story and around people who – on both sides and whatever the facts of the matter actually are – deserve either clarity or to be left alone.	846
As ever when the Oscar nominations are announced, there is a sense of mystery about the industry’s revealed groupthink, that consensus which is unveiled as solemnly as the half-time score at the Super Bowl. This is an interesting and lively Oscar nomination list, but is there something a bit retrograde and nostalgic about the frontrunner – however brilliant it assuredly is? Will the 2021 Oscars reflect modern America and contemporary issues in the way increasingly demanded of awards ceremonies? I’m not sure. David Fincher’s Mank is a gorgeously rendered monochrome fantasy about the genesis of Orson Welles’s classic 1941 movie Citizen Kane, and the role played by its co-writer Herman Mankiewicz, played by Gary Oldman; it is now the frontrunner, surging ahead with 10 nominations, notably in front of Chloé Zhao’s stunning docu-fictional road movie Nomadland, Sound of Metal, with Riz Ahmed as the drummer losing his hearing, Shaka King’s Judas and the Black Messiah, about the FBI’s killing of Black Panther leader Fred Hampton, the dementia drama The Father, with a heartwrenching performance from Anthony Hopkins, Lee Isaac Chung’s Minari, an exceptional tale of Korean immigrant farmers in Reagan’s America, and Aaron Sorkin’s egregious liberal-patriot drama The Trial of the Chicago 7 – all with six. But as for Kelly Reichardt’s First Cow, her wonderful and resonant tale of the old west and one of the very best American films of the year – zilch. Or how about Kitty Green’s stunning sexual politics drama The Assistant? No movie could possibly have confronted with more ferocity and candour the issue of Weinsteinian abuse — something that so recently was convulsing the entire industry. But no nominations there. Those films were comprehensively bested by efforts like News of the World, a very moderate, stolidly unexciting western starring Tom Hanks (with four nominations) or indeed Ron Howard’s ropey and muddled family drama Hillbilly Elegy (with two nominations, including one for Glenn Close for best supporting actress, in the borderline absurd role of the frizzy-haired backwoods grandma.) In fact, it seems that this Oscar nomination list is frankly not especially strong on feminist issues, despite a respectable two out of the five best director nominees being women: Chloé Zhao and Emerald Fennell, for her fierce and brilliant rape-revenge satire Promising Young Woman, which clocks up a solid five nominations, including a best actress nod for Carey Mulligan (who was overlooked in this category by the Baftas). Well, David Fincher’s Mank is a brilliant and bold dive backwards into movie myth, audaciously – and provocatively – creating a lucid dream about one of the greatest films of Hollywood’s golden age. And as ever with anything to do with Welles, it has elicited strong and rather proprietorial reactions from critics and Wellesians, both for and against. I found it an entirely fascinating reverie, although the Academy tends to love movies about its own industry – and maybe embraced it as a kind of comfort food. There is a strong role for Gary Oldman as the hardbitten Herman “Mank” Mankiewicz who is reimagined as a wised-up Bogartian cynic, with everything but a trenchcoat and a gun. The theatrically conceived Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom gets five nominations, including a best actress nod for Viola Davis as the legendary blues singer Gertrude “Ma” Rainey and a posthumous best actor nomination for the late Chadwick Boseman, playing her mercurial trumpeter. These are wonderful performances, though my guess is that Anthony Hopkins’s emotionally devastating performance as the old man with dementia will sweep everything else away on the night. The other big acting performances have to be Daniel Kaluuya and Lakeith Stanfield, each up for best supporting actor in Judas and the Black Messiah, as Black Panther leader Fred Hampton and William O’Neal, the Panthers’ security chief who betrayed him to the FBI. It’s a pity they can’t jointly win. It’s great to see Lee Isaac Chung’s Minari emerge as such a formidable contender, a family drama brilliantly reinventing and reinvigorating the classic theme of incomers chasing the American dream. Veteran Korean star Youn Yuh-jung has a thoroughly deserved best supporting actress nomination as the peppery and outspoken grandmother. Finally, there is Sacha Baron Cohen’s mighty Borat Subsequent Moviefilm, the new adventures of the hapless ex-Soviet bloc reporter, which has two nominations, including a best supporting actress nod for the newcomer Maria Bakalova as Borat’s innocent daughter. She may not defeat Olivia Colman, Glenn Close, Amanda Seyfried and Youn Yuh-jung. But her amazing prank on Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani may have helped change the course of American history.	890
Reunion is a two-in-one horror treat, serving up a scary mother and a spooky old house full of secrets. Evil mums are terrifying and pleasurable in equal measure; reflecting our intergenerational angst while pushing the same dynamic to spectacular heights. Here, Julia Ormond’s deliciously passive-aggressive matriarch delivers both campness and genuine unease. Reunion sees the return of Ellie (Emma Draper), an academic studying black magic, to her New Zealand childhood home. Heavily pregnant, Ellie longs for a quiet weekend to focus on her work, but such hopes are dashed by the presence of her domineering mum Ivy (Ormond) who is packing up the furniture in anticipation of the house’s sale. Like her namesake, Ivy is poisonous, pampering Ellie only to immediately criticise her every move. The atmosphere is claustrophobic, littered with moving boxes as well as unresolved childhood traumas; the decor only enhances this tension with stifling flowery wallpapers a direct contrast to the black gunk oozing from the kitchen sink. Underneath all the prettiness, something is clearly rotting: as Ellie wanders through the corridors of her youth, her repressed memories come flooding back: death, betrayal, unspeakable secrets, darker than any gunk. Reunion is admirably patient: instead of jumpscares, it is more interested in creating an ambience of perverse disquietude: slides of bloody magic rituals, flickering home videos, even brief experimental closeups of internal bodily fluids. These choices initially appear cryptic, but they all come together in the film’s last stretch in a gory, kaleidoscopic spectacle of family trauma. Ormond’sperformance is stunning – she has a magnificent line involving boiling a cauliflower – and there are some truly sublime visual moments. Even if it’s one of those films where the parts are a lot better than the sum, Reunion is sure to linger in the mind. • Reunion is released on 22 March on digital platforms.	359

Lukasz Grzegorzek’s A Coach’s Daughter is an interestingly downbeat movie, veering away from the big scenes and obvious crises that other films with the same idea might have given you, and yet somehow serving them up in different forms. It’s about the intense and borderline inappropriate relationship between a middle-aged tennis coach, Maciej (Jacek Braciak) and his teenage daughter Wiktoria (Karolina Bruchnicka), who is a budding tennis star. He is driving her all over Poland, where they are competing in summer regional tournaments, and hoping for glory; they share hotel rooms and lounge around together in intimate states of undress like a couple, but appear utterly focused on Wiktoria’s training and fitness. On the road they meet Igor (Bartlomiej Kowalski), a bright young teen male star of this tatty circuit, and Maciej offers to let him tag along and to coach him. Clearly, some sort of emotional betrayal is in the offing, especially as Wiktoria and Igor make a rather handsome couple; there is a real chemistry between them, and Wiktoria could well be sick of this monomaniacal discipline. But Maciej has his own secrets and his own emotional needs. Could it be that it he is going to transfer his passion and quasi-parental concern to Igor, the son he never had, and someone who might actually have a better shot at Wimbledon than Wiktoria? A Hollywood version of the same idea might have had both Igor and Wiktoria each building up to a big match and confronting parallel crises; this isn’t what happens here and it’s notable how Grzegorzek skates over the drama of what happens on court. And a different type of movie might have addressed the audience’s unease about the possibly transgressive relationship of Maciej and Wiktoria, but this film coolly declines to let things go that way. A Coach’s Daughter finds its low-key way of controlling the drama. • A Coach’s Daughter is released on 19 March on YourScreen.	376
Here is a thought-experiment of a movie from Brazilian film-makers Clarissa Campolina and Luiz Pretti: it’s a dramatic essay, or docu-fictional romance, or perhaps the cinematic equivalent of an epistolary novel, and it has been much admired on the festival circuit. But intriguing though its premise is, I couldn’t really make friends with this film. Two characters meet in New York and fall in love, but we never see them (though we maybe glimpse them). We do however hear their voices on the soundtrack, musing and commenting. One is Wilson (Marcela Souza e Silva), a Brazilian migrant worker who is in fact about to return to Brazil due to worrying news from home; the other is Lamis (Mary Ghattas), a Lebanese single mum. What we see is the city around them: ambient streetscapes. But it is not true to say that we see what the characters see, because, in this sense, they never see each other or catch sight of themselves in any mirror. We hear their voices, and also that of a central narrator (Grace Passô), but these voices are strangely unanimated. The actors simply read aloud what are evidently Wilson and Lamis’s thoughts, or possibly journal entries, or emails to each other, which are musing and ruminative. The line-readings are weirdly detached and toneless, and there is a disconcerting absence of passion, or even recognisable emotion in these maundering speeches. Finally, Lamis and her child go to Berlin where she has a scholarship and Wilson goes to Belo Horizonte in south-east Brazil; and Campolina and Pretti capture the street-scenes there as well, in the same way. The ending is as enigmatically emotionless as everything else. There is sincerity here and a formal consistency, but there is something obtuse and thin about it all. While We Are Here is released on 19 March on True Story.	360
“This film is dedicated to all the Brothers and Sisters who had enough of the Man,” declare the opening titles of Sweet Sweetback’s Baadasssss Song. When it was released, 50 years ago this month, that was a lot of them. Melvin Van Peebles’s landmark movie arrived at a time when the civil rights movement had barely translated into tangible progress, and was even in danger of being rolled back, what with the recent assassinations of Martin Luther King, Malcolm X and so many others. The Brothers and Sisters had also had enough of the Man’s movies: the only African American representation Hollywood permitted were characters who were either subservient to white folks or super-exemplary, such as Sidney Poitier. Sweetback was neither. Over the course of the movie he breaks all the taboos: he is sexually potent, he defers to no one, he kills racist cops, he supports black revolutionaries, he even sleeps with a white woman. And he survives! No wonder the Black Panthers got behind the movie. It became one of the highest-grossing films of 1971 in the US, despite also being one of the worst-made. Van Peebles at least had excuses for that: he did practically everything himself. He cobbled together the finances (apart from a $50,000 loan from Bill Cosby); he wrote, directed, starred, edited, performed the stunts, and composed the score (with Earth, Wind &amp; Fire); then promoted it himself. As such, despite some avant-garde flourishes, Sweetback is pretty crude and messy to watch. Van Peebles, a well-educated polymath who had lived in Paris, was no amateur, but the execution couldn’t live up to the ambition. The story of Sweetback’s guerrilla making is arguably more entertaining than the movie itself. Indeed, Van Peebles’s son Mario told it in his 2003 movie Baadasssss!, in which he played his dad. Sweetback is often credited as the first “blaxploitation” movie but it doesn’t really fit the description. It paved the way: legend has it that Shaft (released the same year, by a mainstream studio) changed its hero from white to black as a result of it. And it could certainly be seen as exploitative – of children (13-year-old Mario played the young Sweetback in a sex scene that the BFI reissue of the film had to censor under the Protection of Children Act) and women (most of whom appear naked and in awe of Sweetback’s sexual prowess). But it put artistic and commercial power in the hands of black film-makers for the first time, which is the opposite of exploitation. Van Peebles preferred to call it “the first Black Power movie”. He opened the door for not only black cinema (Spike Lee would follow in his DIY footsteps with She’s Gotta Have It), but independent cinema in general. Despite its lo-fi scrappiness, Sweetback remains radical. It really did stick it to the Man.	573
Although the title invokes John Carpenter’s 1976 classic Assault on Precinct 13, one of the all-time great pulpy siege movies, this tale of a hostage-taking at a Veterans Administration hospital in Buffalo, NY, is all pulp, no greatness. In fact, the premise is not so much about an assault as an infiltration that one fortuitously skilful character, who just happens to be around at the time, accidentally foils when the bad guys threaten his wife and child’s safety. In other words: Die Hard, but with a teensy budget that appears to have mostly been used on a visual effect that makes the many shots of bullets entering bodies look like puffs of red dust exploding like scarlet glitter bombs. It’s quite distracting in its shabbiness. Sean Patrick Flanery stars as Jason Hill, a version of Bruce Willis but with more hair and less comic timing. He’s a former soldier whose wife Jennifer (Gina Holden) works as a therapist treating PTSD patients. While waiting in the hospital building for her to finish treating a high-ranking general (Gerald Webb) while their daughter (Sarah Elizabeth Jensen) waits in the parking lot, Hill notices that some of the workers supposedly there to fix a broken elevator, as well as some unfamiliar security guards, are acting kind of hinky. That’s because they’re all bad guys working for Rabikov (Weston Cage Coppola, son of Nicolas Cage): a Russian terrorist who wants to exchange the general and the lives of the hostages he and his minions capture for his brother, who is being held by the US authorities. Coppola’s year-old-Époisses-ripe performance, sporting a surprisingly convincing Russian accent, is one of the more amusing features of this film which is otherwise a fairly bog-standard opportunity to dish out regular doses of gunfire and fisticuffs. • Assault on Station 33 is released on 15 March on digital platforms.	360
There are bad movies, the kind of third-rate film-making we see all the time, and then there are transcendentally bad movies that can only result from deep, fanatical attachment to the material. Director, writer and producer Chris Sanders here achieves something on a par with Ed Wood’s Plan 9 from Outer Space or Tommy Wiseau’s The Room. His Nest of Vampires is a little-England horror-thriller with a plot as over-larded as an Elvis sandwich, uniformly appalling acting, and the same almost beatific earnestness as those two legendary films. MI5 agent Kit Valentine (Tom Fairfoot) leaves his London stamping ground to shake down some unnamed English town for a human trafficking ring that – after his wife is murdered – has abducted his daughter. He needs to get a move on, because the network sells off the girls to moneyed clients to butcher in satanic rituals. Not racy enough? Some of the criminals are also vampires who like a “nibble” on the customers. And Valentine is further up against it when his bosses reveal they are in cahoots. Tied to a chair, though, he has news for them: “You’re not the only secret society that operates within MI5.” Then his own canines turn extra-pointy. For a film so full of brain-freezing exposition, it takes inhuman effort to piece that plot description together. It’s actually a nest of non sequiturs, randomness the only governing principle in a sinkhole of characters, factions, ideas and twists. A prologue refers to lapis lazuli as a means by which vampires can withstand daylight, but this is barely mentioned again. One apparently Italian miscreant – implied to be a vampire, before he isn’t – sounds like the Dolmio Man when he resorts to English: “Good-a point-a!” If criminal networks really were this confusing, the police would have a collective nervous breakdown. Hidden in the aimless scenes and slack direction is the odd nugget of dialogue with a noirish gleam. But mostly it’s pure panto: “I’m about to do a spot of decorating. I was thinking dark red would suit this room.” It may be remiss to dump on a film that cost £30,000, but it seems to be only this type of film-making that can hit a pitch of such sublime pap. Maybe one day Nest of Vampires will get its own Disaster Artist-style eulogy. • Nest of Vampires is released on 16 March on digital platforms.	463
Here’s an unthrilling, bland drama about the rise and fall of Ross Ulbricht, the mastermind behind the illegal online drug emporium Silk Road (described by the FBI as “the Amazon of drug sites”). Between 2011 and 2013, PhD dropout Ulbricht made millions of dollars in commissions from users on the dark web anonymously buying and selling drugs. Then he got busted. If you consider how gripping David Fincher made a bunch of geeks in hoodies talking about algorithms look in The Social Network, the Ulbricht story – involving an FBI manhunt and allegations of murder-for-hire – should be a doddle. But watching Silk Road is a bit like rolling a joint only to find the leafy green substance you’ve been sold is oregano. The highs just don’t come. It starts in 2013, with the feds swooping on 29-year-old Ulbricht (an insipid performance from Nick Robinson) at a San Francisco library. In flashback, he emerges as an unlikely Silicon Valley founder. He ticks some of the dotcom boxes (flip-flops, standup desk, rooftop yoga, breathtaking arrogance), but – unusually – he is a rightwinger. The film’s voiceover borrows from blogs he posted on Silk Road spouting his antigovernment libertarian ideals. Director Tiller Russell is clearly team Ulbricht, and a needy tone creeps into the script; it desperately wants us to like Ulbricht, even when he’s plotting to bump off an employee-turned-informant. Meanwhile, Jason Clarke’s role as a drug enforcement officer falls back on stereotypes of knucklehead, bash-down-the-door cops. He plays Rick Bowden, who gets reassigned to cybercrime (after a stint in rehab) to serve out his last nine months on the job behind a desk. But what do you know, his good old-fashioned police work reaches places that detectives with master’s from MIT can’t. “I’ve been locking up bad guys since before you started shaving your balls,” he growls at his boss. Maybe kingpins aren’t what they used to be. Perhaps millennials have taken the excitement out of organised crime. You won’t find much in this movie. • Silk Road is released on 22 March on digital platforms.	417
“Your dad kept you locked up in an old house,” a character drunkenly blurts out in this adaptation of Kelly Braffet’s gothic novel about childhood misery and brother-and-sister incest. “It’s soooo Flowers in the Attic.” If only! The most shocking thing about this movie is how stale and lifeless it is, as if entire scenes had been placed into a vacuum storage bag, zipped up, and sucked of all energy and human feeling. Set in the 1990s, it begins in rural Pennsylvania where 16-year-old Josie (Olivia DeJonge) and her older brother Jack (Alex Neustaedter) have been raised in a spooky old house by their physics professor father (William Fichtner). He’s a violent pompous drunk who homeschools the kids rather than sending them to “the idiot factory” local high school. In a few flatly acted scenes, he rants grandiosely about his university colleagues and hurls crockery at his children. Jack is a good-looking bad boy who instructs Josie to seduce the kid behind the counter of the local pharmacy so he can get his hands on prescription drugs. And Jack creepily paws at his sister, stroking her hair and walking into the bathroom when she’s in the shower. Director Sarah Lancaster’s script, co-written with Braffet, keeps the audience guessing right up to the end how far things have gone between them – but there is so little visible chemistry between the actors you may not care either way. Eventually, after a massive barney at home, the siblings escape, arriving penniless in New York where Jack attaches himself to an Upper West Side socialite, Lily – a brittle performance by Annabelle Dexter-Jones so good it deserves a better role. As for Josie, she is a disappointing non-character – often spotted with her nose in battered Kafka paperback to show she’s got a brain, but 90 minutes pass before she gets a chance to use it. Unintentionally, perhaps, the film is the story of monstrous men (a daddy dictator and controlling brother); the women are weirdly blank. • Josie &amp; Jack is released on 22 March on digital platforms.	405
Film industry pressure on the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), the body that organises the Golden Globe awards, has increased after more than 100 public relations firms sent a letter telling the organisation they had withdrawn all their celebrity clients from activities with the HFPA until it made “profound and lasting change” to correct what it described as the HFPA’s “longstanding exclusionary ethos … discriminatory behavior [and] ethical impropriety”. According to Variety, the letter, signed by high-profile PR outfits including DDA, Premier, 42West and Rogers &amp; Cowan/PMK, was delivered to the HFPA on Monday, following continuing criticism of the crisis-plagued organisation. The letter reads: “We cannot advocate for our clients to participate in HFPA events or interviews as we await your explicit plans and timeline for transformational change.” “Anything less than transparent, meaningful change that respects and honors the diversity and dignity of our clients, their colleagues and our global audience will result in immediate and irreparable damage to the relationship between our agencies, our clients and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.” The Golden Globes TV broadcast is the HFPA’s most high-profile and lucrative event, and an industry boycott would be devastating. The HFPA’s troubles were sparked by a report in the LA Times shortly before the most recent Golden Globe awards show, in which the HFPA was accused of a lack of diversity in its membership as well as “ethical lapses” in the way it conducted its business. The organisation’s response, in which it said it would add “Black and other underrepresented professionals to [the] organisation” and improve “transparency” over its voting and membership processes, was deemed inadequate by high-profile film industry campaign group Time’s Up. The HFPA responded to the publicists’ letter with a statement in which it acknowledged it “should have done more, and sooner”, and said it would ensure that “at least 13 per cent of the membership be Black journalists” by the end of the year.	383
A curio that’s lain dormant for many years since it first sashayed on to screens in 1985, this Japanese teeny-bop musical supports the argument that not all cult films need to be revived. Ultimately, some were flops the first time round for good reason. That said, lovers of Asian kawaii culture, camp and Japanese bubblegum pop, which all converge in this confection, are likely to be satisfied. Like so many of pop-tastic exploitation projects (see also the Monkees’ Head), the music comes first and the story splicing it all together a distant second. Musician-impresario Haruo Chikada composed the soundtrack of cheesy, synth-heavy bop and then hired director Makoto Tezuka (son of the famous manga artist Osamu Tezuka, creator of Astro Boy) to string the songs together into a script. Et voila, the confection they came up with this is a self-referential tale of two aspiring pop stars: temperamentally scratchy Shingo (Shingo Kubota) and cooler, albeit mulleted, pretty-boy Kan (Kan Takagi), who are brought together by a record company executive in order to create a commercially compelling duo. Marimo, a random girl they meet at the label’s headquarters, is drafted in to become the head of their fan club, before they even have much of a fan club to start. The songs, a glorious mishmash of genres ranging from sub-Joy Division post-punk to ska beats to moody new wave drones, are fitfully entertaining (with their poorly translated lyrics about topics including maxed-out credit cards, tomato juice and artistic ambition). But it’s all so clumsily assembled and herky-jerky, it gets more irritating than amusing over the long haul. The best bits are where it totally goes off into crazy-town with zombie monsters played by actors in latex masks and then back to (relative) reality as if nothing has happened. • The Legend of the Stardust Brothers is released on 18 March on Mubi.	362
The spirit of Roger Corman’s original Little Shop of Horrors lives again in this entirely ridiculous but often amusing and sharp horror-satire from Canadian film-maker Elza Kephart, set in an unbearably cool clothes shop, in which the sales assistants cruise around talking to each other with mic-headsets, but hardly deign to communicate with the customers. Romaine Denis plays Libby, a starry-eyed young woman who is thrilled to have got a job at this store, awed by its visionary CEO and by the company’s commitment to non-exploitative practices and its ethical attitude to the developing-world communities where the clothes are made and where the cotton is grown. But of course it is all nonsense. The company cuts costs with sweatshop contractors in south Asia, and the super-cool jeans that it is bringing in for its new line are in fact haunted by the vengeful spirits of those workers in India who have been injured and killed. And so, for the special evening in which these new garments are to be unveiled at the store to an elite of hipsters and Instagram influencers, the jeans themselves run amok in a bloody orgy of revenge against the first-world fashionistas. It is all very silly, and some of the script and acting are a bit broad (though perfectly consistent with the overall style). The scenes where the jeans come to life like malign reptiles and even start dancing on the shop floor are good; some videos over the closing credits cheerfully reveal the tech wizardry that created these effects. An entertaining skewering of the hidden global politics in retail trendiness. • Slaxx is released on 18 March on Shudder.	300
“I learned a great lesson from Chappaquiddick … don’t drive over narrow bridges when you’re pissed out of your mind.” This gag from the BBC’s 1970s sketch show Not the Nine O’Clock News, with Griff Rhys Jones playing a sombre Ted Kennedy, perfectly encapsulates his cynicism and self-pity. It seems to me more apposite than this lenient movie about Chappaquiddick, which now belatedly appears in the UK, starring Jason Clarke as Kennedy, scripted by first-time feature writers Taylor Allen and Andrew Logan, and directed by John Curran. While driving back in darkness from a party at Chappaquiddick Island in Massachusetts in July 1969, Kennedy’s car went off a narrow bridge into the water. Kennedy swam clear, but his passenger drowned: Mary Jo Kopechne, a woman who had worked as a researcher for his late brother Bobby. Having failed to report the incident for eight hours and toyed with the idea of claiming Mary Jo was driving, Kennedy finally admitted to leaving the scene of an accident, accepted a suspended two-year sentence and gave a televised address claiming he hadn’t been drinking and there was no impropriety with Kopechne. The US had no great appetite for spoiling the moon-landing euphoria with a political scandal, or spoiling the tragic Kennedy mystique . So the media and political classes suppressed their distaste and embarrassment, allowing Kennedy to plough on with his long but undistinguished senatorial career and a failed bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1980. Clarke plausibly plays an entitled and defensive Kennedy, his flushed face set in a rictus of fear and unrepentant resentment; Kate Mara is Kopechne, and Bruce Dern is the macabre figure of Joe Kennedy Sr, incapacitated by a stroke and seething with mute rage and contempt for his deadbeat son. It’s a movie that in important ways is on Ted Kennedy’s side. It does not show him drinking heavily, or drinking much at all at the party, and does not show him kissing or having sex with the similarly non-drinking Kopechne; just being very close and intimate about his fears and plans. And when the car starts going out of control, it is Mary Jo’s panicky gesticulation that obscures his view of the road. But the film shows how the family courtiers and spin doctors rallied round: from big cheeses like the former secretary of defense Robert McNamara (Clancy Brown) to Ted’s beta-male cousin and fixer Joe Gargan (Ed Helms). It persuasively suggests how Kennedy did indeed retreat into a stunned state of denial, and that the catastrophe of Chappaquiddick jolted him into something that looked almost like political seriousness. Namely, his traumatised horror of prosecution, a mannerism that he carried over into the long anticlimax of his political career. Yet The Senator is rather prim and prissy in its reluctance to acknowledge what is under its nose and what has been under American history’s nose for more than 50 years: the possibility that Ted Kennedy was just very drunk and that he had had or was eager to have extramarital sex. And the film could have done more to dramatise Kopechne’s life and show that she was something more than a footnote. Some interesting moments here, but the film is one long pulled punch. • The Senator is released on 19 March on Amazon Prime Video.	626
It started as a hashtag: a cheekily insurgent social-media campaign against big media corporations who presume to tell superhero devotees what’s good for them. Enraged by DC’s lacklustre Justice League movie in 2017 – which director Zack Snyder had to abandon during postproduction after a family tragedy, and which an uncredited Joss Whedon re-shot and re-edited – the fans took to Twitter demanding that DC Films #ReleaseTheSnyderCut. Like the GameStop share price, hopes soared. But so did cynical suspicions that a pristine “cut” would eventually be fabricated to cash in on customer excitement. The Welles cut of The Magnificent Ambersons and the Von Stroheim cut of Greed are still not with us, but the Snyder cut of Justice League is, with a new chiaroscuro look, new backstories, new minor characters and a new, disturbing ending. Its sheer colossal size, its sepulchral feeling of doom and its trance-like sense of its own mythic grandeur make it weirdly entertaining, although the familiar superhero-movie MacGuffins are there, and the film needs to absorb the slightly uncharismatic performance of Henry Cavill, an actor who perhaps does not soar to the standards of superness, and is better off playing a character called, simply, Man, with an M on his chest and who has to walk everywhere. Did Snyder really intend the original film to last four hours? Well, this one does: an epic so splurgingly huge that you can see how it might have been purposed as four streaming episodes. Yet its dramatic and theological craziness only really come across when you consume it all at once. As the film begins, the whole world is in mourning after Superman’s death, and humanity is now menaced by the intergalactically evil Steppenwolf (voiced by Ciarán Hinds), who is after three “mother boxes” that are somewhere on Earth – three occult crucibles of cosmic power which together give their owner complete universal control – left behind, apparently, from a previous incursion. So plutocrat Bruce Wayne wishes to assemble a crack crew of superheroes, the Justice League, to defend the planet in Superman’s memory. They will be the disciples of Superman, and Diane Lane and Amy Adams play Superman’s mum, Martha, and girlfriend, Lois Lane, respectively the Blessed Virgin and Mary Magdalene of the Superman story. Wayne is played by Ben Affleck with stubble, a perennial expression of lantern-jawed discontent and a voice that drops to a growly lowness when he’s in character as Batman (even though everyone around him knows perfectly well who he is). Gal Gadot is the stylish, creamy-browed Wonder Woman, while Jason Momoa is Aquaman, who is in civvy street as Iceland’s answer to Crocodile Dundee, hanging out with bearded, jumper-wearing Nordic fisherfolk in the pub until the time comes for him to embrace his superheroic destiny. Ray Fisher is the troubled bionic teen Victor Stone, or Cyborg, and Ezra Miller has the quirky and smart-alecky role of Barry Allen, the Flash, whose job is to supply the ironic self-awareness. There are some nice supporting performances, most notably from Willem Dafoe, who somehow confers actorly dignity on the role of Nuidis Vulko, an undersea personage of Atlantis. Jeremy Irons is Wayne’s manservant (one might almost say his batman) Alfred, who is reimagined as a silver-fox hipster and gadget specialist, waspish of tongue and fussing over the tea served to the Justice League, but who will keep saying “Master Wayne”. (“Master Bruce”, surely?) You can see from a mile away where it is all going – or rather from three hours and 55 minutes away – and for me, the Justice League still does not have the colour, flair, snap and zap of the Avengers in the MCU; it comes to life most in the regular cityscape settings that it seems keen to avoid. But there is something absorbing about this operatically strange twilight-of-the-superhero-gods that might yet turn out to be daybreak. The film has something preposterous but surreal, and there is a disturbing epilogue in which Wayne is confronted by his personal demons. Snyder’s film may be exhausting but it is engaging. Justice is served. Zack Snyder’s Justice League is released on 18 March in the UK on Sky Cinema and in the US on HBO Max.	815
Here is a puzzle or a riddle of a psychological movie, with distant echoes of Roeg’s Bad Timing or Antonioni’s Blow-Up. A brilliant and beautiful Hungarian neurosurgeon, Márta (Natasa Stork), abandons her career in the United States just shy of her 40th birthday and returns to Budapest. And why? Because she has met a handsome compatriot at an academic conference: János (Viktor Bodó) is a fellow surgeon who romantically arranged to meet Márta at a certain time and date at the city’s Liberty Bridge. But János doesn’t show up, and when Márta tracks him down and confronts him, he merely says with an air of baffled politeness that they have never met. Márta takes a job in Budapest and rents a certain scuzzy apartment because it has a view of the now totemic, or cursed, bridge and begins to stalk János online, even uncovering a video of him as a child winning a singing competition with an arrangement of Schubert’s Trout Quintet. But her career still prospers, with brilliant diagnoses and masterly surgeries, which intrigue János. So what is going on? Is János lying? Is Márta delusional? Or is this her kind of obsession-based “magical thinking” – has Márta imagined what she wants in the future, and made an unconscious decision to behave as if it is the case, forcing the facts to rearrange themselves around her wishes, like iron filings around a magnet? The paradox of the film’s narrative procedure is that it is shown from her point of view, not János’s, and yet it is Márta’s account that the audience is tacitly invited to challenge. The movie can’t quite match the drama – and the shock – of János’s denial of Márta at the very beginning, and the ending ties things up a little neatly. It is at once a relief and an obscure disappointment that the mystery is not left enigmatically unsolved. • Preparations to Be Together for an Unknown Period of Time is released on 19 March on Curzon Home Cinema.	393
She was born into a working-class Staffordshire family in 1899 and was sent to work in the potteries aged just 13 before going on to become one of the country’s most influential ceramicists. Now Clarice Cliff has inspired a feature film that will show how she broke the mould in the pottery industry, revolutionising the workplace and bringing art to the masses with plates, jugs and teapots that were as affordable as they were colourful. In the Sky Original production, to be announced on Wednesday, she will be portrayed by Phoebe Dynevor, who played Daphne the debutante in Netflix’s hit series Bridgerton. The factory owner Colley Shorter, who recognised Cliff’s talent, sending her to the Royal College of Art in London and setting her up in her own studio, will be depicted by Matthew Goode whosefilms include The Imitation Game. The film’s director, Claire McCarthy, said its title, The Colour Room, reflects Cliff’s artistic achievement in making colour and beauty accessible to everybody. She said: “She managed to find really innovative ways to bring ceramics into production. They were cheap and cheerful in a sense, but they were inspired by cutting-edge modernist artists.” The film will portray Cliff as a vivacious young factory worker, whose father had worked in the iron industry and whose mother took in washing to make ends meet. With the support of other women in the factory and Shorter, she went on to design her art deco Bizarre range, with abstract, geometric and figural forms. During the Great Depression, she ensured the factory’s survival and her future as one of the greatest art deco designers, becoming one of the first women to launch a line under her own name. She found inspiration in cubism and other artistic styles to create pieces adored by the public for their bright colours, vibrant patterns and innovative shapes, bringing modernity to the kitchen sink. McCarthy said that Cliff, who died in 1972, rewrote the rules of “an entrenched hierarchical world”. “Modelling or designing was never territory where women were represented … at that time, there was a rigid understanding of how a person lived their lives. Particularly for women, the opportunities were very slim. Clarice was a beacon of change,” she said. Cliff’s timeless designs are widely collected worldwide. In 2003, Christie’s sold a 1933 charger, inspired by a Modigliani painting, for a record £39,950. The Victoria and Albert Museum in London and the Metropolitan Museum in New York are among public institutions in which her work is represented. The film has been written by Claire Peate, winner of the 2016 Bafta Rocliffe new writing competition, who said: “The story was inspired by a single image – a young factory worker leaving her grim, industrial reality behind her and stepping into the rainbow of the Colour Room – a world of joy and possibility.” The film’s cast includes David Morrissey (The Walking Dead), Darci Shaw (Judy) and Kerry Fox (Rare Beasts). Dynevor said: “The script is a beautifully written contemporary take on the 20th century, and I feel proud to be working with such a strong female team, both in front of and behind the camera.” Co-produced by Sky, Caspian Films and Creative England, The Colour Room will start production later this month in Stoke-on-Trent and Birmingham and will be released in cinemas and on Sky Cinema later this year. McCarthy, whose previous productions include Ophelia, a reimagining of Hamlet starring Daisy Ridley, said that they have secured permission to reproduce Cliff’s designs for a film that will be “very faithful” to her story. She said: “Back in the day, there were 2,000 kilns firing up 24/7, and now it’s only about 25 that still remain. So there are remnants of original factories that we are using to make our … factory in the film. We are enlisting so much support from the local community … fantastic skilled workers, craftspeople and artists … who have such a strong history and connection to the Potts.” Pottery has been recognised as a calming activity during stressful times, with the television competition The Great Pottery Throw Down – which has a similar premise to The Great British Bake Off – attracting big audiences. “There seems to be a zeitgeist about, not only pottery and ceramics, but things made by hand,” said McCarthy. “Quite a few shows celebrate that … the magic that one can make with one’s own hands. There’s something comforting in that.”	868
Here’s a documentary that shines a light on squalid corner of British post-imperial legacy: the batches of mercenaries – largely former military personnel – who roamed the world’s trouble spots in the 70s and 80s, killing for hire in numerous civil conflicts in Africa and Latin America. (As this film suggests, these ex-SAS types weren’t politically neutral: they were actively keen on killing communists in places like Angola and Rhodesia.) The film focuses on an escapade that is – ethically speaking – a little less murky than cold war Africa: a plot to assassinate the super-powerful Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar in the late 1980s. However, since it was organised at the behest of another super-powerful Colombian drug lord, any claims to the moral high ground are not really supportable. The principal interviewees here are Peter McAleese, a former paratrooper who grew up in Glasgow and was responsible for the military activities of the assassination squad, and the somewhat more dapper David Tomkins, the man who organised the contracts and who by his own account moved enormous amounts of arms into conflict zones. McAleese and Tomkins relate the story of their mission efficiently enough. We know it is doomed to fail, as history tells us Escobar was shot dead a few years later, in 1993, by a Colombian police unit. Presumably to crank up the narrative tension, director David Whitney adds a series of reconstruction-flashback scenes of McAleese, alone and injured in the Colombian rainforest. With little signposting, they slow down the film’s momentum, even if we eventually learn where they fit in in the bigger scheme of things. It all seems rather affable until a shipment of weapons turns up: the gun lust on show underscores the abhorrent nature of the enterprise. Rather like a veteran ex-football hooligan, McAleese is heroically frank about his propensity for violence as he fills in his backstory, offering up as evidence his rough Glaswegian upbringing next door to Barlinnie prison (he points out the cell window from which his hardman father would signal when he was doing time). On some level, McAleese’s scorn for his former self is a reasonably creditable attempt to confront the consequences of the destruction he has caused, even if there is an evasiveness about the way he focuses on failings in his personal life rather than his victims, in Africa or elsewhere. At 79, he’s still a scary individual. • Killing Escobar is out now on digital platforms.	464
For a film as cursed as family comedy The War with Grandpa, shot back in 2017 then sidelined and sold as a result of Harvey Weinstein’s downfall, it’s a very minor victory to report that rather than being bad, it’s merely bland, an adequate milquetoast time-waster for a very young and very undiscerning audience. What makes that description slightly harder to stomach is the unusually stacked cast – two-time Oscar winner Robert De Niro, Oscar winner Christopher Walken, Oscar nominee Uma Thurman – whose combined star power gently lifts rather than carries a film that’s leagues beneath them. It’s glumly become the sort of sleepwalk role we now expect of De Niro, an actor with an ever-diminishing batting average, whose note-perfect performance in last year’s The Irishman was more exception than rule. He’s returning to the titular role of Grandpa, after shagging and swearing his way through Dirty Grandpa, to play a PG-rated technology-hating, wife-grieving cipher of a man whose latest misadventure (stealing food after losing his cool with a supermarket self-checkout – groan) has his daughter (Thurman) insist that he comes to stay with her family. But a shortage of rooms means that he has to turf grandson Peter (Oakes Fegley) out of his bed, sending him to the attic, leading to a farcical, yet low-stakes, battle of escalating pranks. Based on the book by Robert Kimmel Smith, there’s a decent kernel of an idea here and the script, from writing partners Tom J Astle and Matt Ember, briefly flirts with something more substantial, at least in the first act. An unmoored and displaced grandparent is understandably reluctant to allow himself to be taken care of and there are a few quiet moments, nicely played by De Niro, that show a man struggling to find his place in a world without his wife. But by the third time we see him pick up a framed photo of his dearly departed, we start realising that creativity is in short supply along with characterisation and the film falls into a repetitive back-and-forth between the duelling relatives. It’s slickly made by longtime family film director Tim Hill and there’s a decent enough budget to give it a sheen so often missing from its streaming equivalents but there’s no amount of gloss that can distract from its one-note vacuity, something even its high-wattage cast can’t fix. There’s no longer any novelty in seeing De Niro goof around in a series of slapstick scenarios and instead, it’s rather depressing especially given the lack of ingenuity on display here (he accidentally flashes his son-in-law twice). He’s as bored as we are and while Thurman gives it a bit more effort, it’s also embarrassing to see her act the clown for a film as rote and unnecessary as this. Watching them, along with Walken, trudge their way through this kind of slop, all one can hope is that their paycheques were worth it and that their upcoming slates allow for some swift redemption. Even when a film is aimed at such a young, undemanding audience, there are still ways to elevate but Astle and Ember keep things base-level, defiantly ignoring the enjoyment of anyone over the age of 12 and giving those within its target demographic very little that feels unique or even vaguely amusing. The “war” at its centre is too benign to register, each prank dumber than the last, and the whole film is scuppered by a major plot hole: that somehow despite loud, property-destroying acts of aggression, no one else in the family notices their feud until the very end. The fact that The War with Grandpa finally dragged itself off from the shelf is something of a win but now that we’re able to see it, the real loser is us. The War with Grandpa is now out in cinemas in the US with a UK date to be announced	744
“I’m talentless. But I make things happen.” That’s record label supremo Alan McGee speaking. It’s not remotely true: his taste is his talent. In the 80s and 90s, McGee put out records by the Jesus and Mary Chain, My Bloody Valentine, Primal Scream and Teenage Fanclub. Now comes a biopic: a lairy, likable film directed by Lock Stock actor Nick Moran. Creation Stories is co-written by McGee’s mate Irvine Welsh and Dean Cavanagh, who have adapted McGee’s 2013 autobiography. And it’s the cracking script that is the star here, giving McGee just enough working-class gobshite cheekiness (“I’m just a wee ginger tool from Glasgow”) to balance out the myth-making and megalomania. (This is a man who had a sign on his desk that read: “President of Pop”.) McGee said in a recent interview that he vetoed Ewan McGregor playing him in the film because the actor is too good looking. Instead, the role went to another, less Hollywood Trainspotting alumnus, Ewen Bremner, whose portrayal is spot-on. There’s a brilliant scene where the bailiffs come knocking at the offices of McGee’s label Creation Records. He is on the phone trying to stave off creditors: “I’ve got a new band. They’re gonna be bigger than U2.” It’s total rubbish, but he uses the line again and again – and in the end it comes true. In 1993, McGee discovers Oasis at King Tut’s in Glasgow. Welsh’s script hilariously downplays this life-changing signing: McGee is only at the venue because he missed a train to London, while Oasis – total unknowns – are not even on the bill, but blag their way on stage. (“It’ll give the DJ 20 minutes for a shite,” says the venue’s manager.) The actors playing bands in the Creation stable look the part – the Gallagher brothers may have been cast for their eyebrows alone – but don’t get much screen time. In flashbacks, Leo Flanagan does a good job playing McGee as a teenager. Transformed by watching the Sex Pistols on TV he starts a band in his bedroom with a mate from school, Bobby Gillespie (later of Primal Scream). Director Moran doesn’t go too deep, not dwelling on the beatings heaped on McGee by his dad, or the nine months he spent getting clean in 1994. This can leave the characters feeling a bit two-dimensional, but the inspired chaos feels right. In another terrific scene, McGee bursts into a studio where My Bloody Valentine are recording Loveless – an album that took so long to record it almost bankrupted Creation. After the band has McGee ejected by security, he kicks off and ends up in the back of a police car ranting about frontman Kevin Shields (“that money-spunking mad genius”). In 1992, McGee sold 49% of Creation to Sony, and later nudged Britpop into bed with Tony Blair, before becoming disillusioned with New Labour in power. Blair is played here as smarmy and insincere; Cherie is sharper, but Alastair Campbell will surely be unhappy with the portrayal of him gormlessly toe-tapping away to the house-lite election anthem Things Can Only Get Better. And can it really be true that McGee left Chequers in horror at Jimmy Savile being a dinner guest all the way back in 1999? • Creation Stories is available on Sky Cinema from 20 March. • This article was amended on 25 March 2021.

Russia’s hooligan set will have a new Friday-night post-pub favourite with this martial arts film, modelled on Gareth Evans’s The Raid. In a literal hostile takeover, former Spetsnaz sniper Nikita (Ivan Kotik) leads a squad of tracksuited casuals into a vodka factory/mafia front on behalf of a shady businessmen (Ilya Antonenko) looking to seize it – but he also has a personal beef with the owner. For reasons half-explained, the squad are forbidden from carrying guns, and the chief heavy (played by real-life MMA fighter Vladimir Mineev) chafes against Nikita’s command from the off. They work their way up through the factory’s security to the C-suite, with much fisticuffs, mostly in the fashionable MMA style – with heavy emphasis on grappling and backhanded slaps that look prissy but probably aren’t. The standout is a corridor-hemmed brawl against three juggernauts wielding a host of medieval weaponry, with director Denis Kryuchkov often keeping us locked in with the combatants with swaying, reeling Steadicam. But introducing firearms halfway through, when the factory’s true owners enter the fray, works to somehow lower the stakes. As more parties become involved, the already poorly defined relationships between the characters become get more confusing – including what white-suited secretary (Sofya Ozerova) is doing there other than providing openings for misogynistic jeopardy. (She’s given an empowering assault rifle later.) The initial tone of impish mayhem shifts into something grim and rote, ill-serving frontman Kotik. Interestingly lithe, aloof and not overly macho, he has obvious star chops – breaking out in some fights into footwork drawn from the Russian folk dancing he does in one childhood flashback. “Balletic” used to be the adjective of choice for John Woo’s action films, and Kotik is clearly primed to deliver this in material that is more than this steroid party. • Russian Raid is released on 22 March on digital platforms.	364
Here is a humane and undeniably moving documentary about Amber Davies, a girl with Down’s syndrome, filmed over four years as she enters and moves up the school system. An hour in length, and released to coincide with World Down Syndrome Day, it examines her progress through three linked but separate perspectives, bringing together moments of beauty and joy as well as the harsher realities that not even childhood can escape. Olivia, Amber’s neurotypical twin, is a constant presence, showing great maturity, helping her sister with daily tasks and taking time to understand her. We also hear directly from her via voiceover; she doesn’t hide how she feels when she believes her sister has been unjustly treated, and articulates her hopes that Amber will be able to stay in the same school as her. The second perspective belongs to Ian Davies, Amber’s father and the film’s director. A largely off-screen presence, Davies is clearly a loving and encouraging father; it would have been interesting to hear directly from him. But the repeated scenes in which Davies visits his daughter’s play-shop are a nice touch, establishing atmosphere where we can observe Amber’s development for ourselves. Amber’s perspective, of course, takes centre stage, a valuable corrective to the current mire of neurodivergent-as-plot-device in mainstream cinema. The film reminds us that Amber is a fully realised individual, with interests and feelings to explore: she wall-climbs with her father, bakes with her sister and demonstrates an emotional complexity that most media would not appreciate. As the film progresses, we can only root for Amber, happy for her advances and feeling her pain when things stall. A labour of love in the most accurate sense. Amber and Me is released on 21 March on digital platforms.	342
This year’s Oscars are billed as the great democratic race. Eligibility for all awards has been relaxed, so films don’t have to have had a conventional theatrical release. This has led to a larger number of titles in contention – 41 on Monday’s shortlist – as well a greater diversity of voices. But such egality of access has not yet stretched to UK viewers. While audiences in the US are uniquely able to see all the hottest films from the comfort of their own homes (streaming costs permitting), UK audiences are left in the familiar position of playing catchup, hearing exciting things about films still months away from release. This is because the streaming infrastructure in the UK is less well-established than in the US, so outside major players such as Netflix, Amazon, Disney+ and Apple, distributors do not have the deals in place for straightforward online premieres. And while US cinemas have only begun reopening in the past fortnight, UK distributors have had periods in which they could screen films in cinemas, and so have sought to delay releases to fit in with these windows. These goalposts, however, have shifted continually, with a domino effect on films. A smattering of awards movies are now due out in the UK in early April, a hangover from the hope that cinemas would be allowed to reopen in late March. The earliest they can now do so is 17 May; hence a sudden flurry of activity over the past few weeks on digital platforms for titles such as Judas and the Black Messiah, with distributors eager to capitalise on awards buzz and conscious such films might struggle to secure a sizeable cinema audience many weeks down the line. Judas is also one of a number of contenders this year with a strikingly American focus. As with One Night in Miami, The Trial of the Chicago 7 and Da 5 Bloods, it is a fictionalised riff on a moment in US history, while Mank, The United States Vs Billie Holiday and Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom give us new takes on American cultural icons. Even leading contender Nomadland – Chloé Zhao’s elegiac look at the life of retirees in US who live in their vans – feels distinctly domestic. That film, originally financed by 20th Century Fox, will make its UK debut on the unlikely platform of Disney+, following the company’s buyout of Fox. Films more likely to prove catnip to the UK crowd are being strategically repositioned around the current plan for the easing of lockdown. Sound of Metal, starring best actor nominee Riz Ahmed as a drummer with hearing loss, is now scheduled to open in cinemas on 17 May following a brief spell on streamers, while best picture contenders such as the Anthony Hopkins dementia drama The Father and Thomas Vinterberg’s Another Round, have opted to play even safer, shifting to June releases. The presumption is that by then UK cinemas may be more fully operational and blockbuster counter-programming will pay dividends. Such optimism is currently shared by the distributors of the new James Bond movie, No Time to Die. Following a series of delays beginning last spring, they recently brought the release date forward by 10 days to late September.

The actor Armie Hammer is under investigation for sexual assault, Los Angeles police said Thursday. Hammer is the main suspect in a sexual assault that was reported to police on 3 February, an LAPD spokesperson said. Police did not give further details. The accuser, known as Effie, was 20 at the time of the alleged rape in 2017. After meeting the Call Me by Your Name star via Facebook months prior, she claims, they briefly dated while he was married. Speaking at a press conference earlier in the day, Effie claimed that Hammer had raped her for four hours, during which he “repeatedly slammed” her face against a wall along with other “violent acts”. “I thought he was going to kill me,” she said. Her attorney, Gloria Allred, hosted the press conference on Thursday, during which Effie spoke to journalists. Allred has passed all details, including an alleged picture of Effie’s injuries, to the police. During the Zoom conference, Allred also showed a picture of Effie and Hammer together. When asked if they planned to file a lawsuit against the actor, Allred stated: “We have no plan or intention to do that at this time.” In response, Hammer’s lawyer sent the Guardian an undated screengrab of text messages purporting to come from the accuser implying that she had been suggesting a form of extreme sex with the actor in July 2020. “From day one, Mr Hammer has maintained that all of his interactions with [the accuser] – and every other sexual partner of his for that matter – have been completely consensual, discussed and agreed upon in advance, and mutually participatory. [Her] attention-seeking and ill-advised legal bid will only make it more difficult for real victims of sexual violence to get the justice they deserve.” The allegation comes after months of alleged messages from Hammer being disseminated online concerning his sexual interests and after an ex-girlfriend, Paige Lorenze, spoke to Vanity Fair about an extreme relationship the pair shared. “You never know what you’re going to get with him – he’s kind of a scary person,” Lorenze said. “He would say things to me ... weird stuff ... like, ‘I want to eat your ribs.’” In response to the original article, Hammer’s lawyer issued the following statement: “All interactions between Mr Hammer and his former partners were consensual. They were fully discussed, agreed upon in advance with his partners, and mutually participatory. The stories perpetuated on social media were designed to be salacious in an effort to harm Mr Hammer, but that does not make them true.” Hammer and his ex-wife, Elizabeth Chambers, announced their divorce in July 2020. In January, the actor stepped away from starring alongside Jennifer Lopez in the romantic comedy Shotgun Wedding. “I’m not responding to these bullshit claims but in light of the vicious and spurious online attacks against me, I cannot in good conscience now leave my children for four months to shoot a film in the Dominican Republic,” he said at the time. He has since left the miniseries The Offer, set to tell the behind-the-scenes tale of how The Godfather was made. Agencies contributed reporting In the US, Rainn offers support on 800-656-4673.

“Bottom line, it was fun,” says self-declared Glaswegian ginger bastard Alan McGee (Ewen Bremner). Poolside in LA, the music executive reflects on his label, Creation Records, which ran from 1983 to 1999 and produced acts including the Jesus and Mary Chain, Primal Scream and Oasis. Suki Waterhouse plays a journalist profiling McGee, a framing device that should, in theory, allow the film to rollick through his formative moments and skip over any boring bits. It’s not unfun, exactly, to watch McGee going on an ill-advised coke bender with a sleazy film producer played by Jason Isaacs, ingratiating himself with Tony Blair (James Payton) and taking advice from an occultist (Steven Berkoff) he hallucinates at a house party. Yet the frenetic pacing, intended to sweep the audience along, can’t draw attention away from Irvine Welsh and Dean Cavanagh’s platitude-riddled script. Their key message, to “be a rebel, always”, as underscored in a Trainspotting-lite speech that closes out the film, feels oddly generic.	201
There’s a welcome streak of black comedy running through Latvian director Juris Kursietis’s second feature, which follows a young Latvian immigrant as he struggles to establish a new life in Belgium. In many ways, Oleg’s (Valentin Novopolskij) situation is sobering. He is unfairly dismissed from his job at a meat-processing plant after a colleague loses a finger. His living situation is precarious and at the mercy of villainous Polish landlord and mafioso Andrzej (Dawid Ogrodnik). And despite a new gig as a roofer, he can’t seem to get paid. A day trip to Ghent to visit Hubert and Jan Van Eyck’s altarpiece, The Adoration of the Mystic Lamb, finds Oleg haunted by his grandmother’s insistence that its sacrificial lamb is hopeful, not sad. The film refuses to get bogged down in the bleakness of Oleg’s predicament, with Kursietis’s irrepressibly lively handheld camera emphasising his protagonist’s sense of perpetual forward motion. Ogrodnik’s performance as landlord Andrzej, a charismatic smooth-talker who seduces Oleg with promises of Fifa matches and free food in a kind of frat house for migrants, lightens things too. In one scene he teaches Oleg to fire a gun in the woods. “You are ready now,” he declares, as a terrified Oleg misses his mark, the bullet just skimming his shoe. • On Mubi from 23 March	266
The Hungarian entry for best international feature film may not have made it into the 93rd Oscars selection, but I’d strongly suggest that you place it on your own viewing shortlist. From its teasingly enigmatic title (translated fairly literally from the Hungarian original) to its neatly cyclical narrative, this crystalline tale of memory, love and brain surgery from writer-director Lili Horvát (who made 2015’s The Wednesday Child) is a treat – sinewy, seductive and beautifully strange. Natasa Stork is quietly charismatic as Márta Vizy, a Hungarian neurosurgeon who has carved out a respectable career in the US. Yet following a brief encounter with fellow brain specialist and author János Drexler (Viktor Bodó) at a medical conference in New Jersey, her life has been upturned by the realisation that he is “what I’ve been looking for”. Now she’s in Budapest, waiting to meet the man she loves. But when János fails to show up for their hastily arranged rendezvous at the Liberty Bridge, Márta seeks him out at his hospital, only to be told that he has no memory of ever meeting her before. Has Márta encountered a doppelganger? Is János just pretending not to know her? Or has she simply imagined their putative relationship, carefully conjuring “every detail so even I believe it happened”? As a student of the mind, Márta knows only too well the tricks it can play (the film opens with a quote from Sylvia Plath’s Mad’s Girl’s Love Song: “I think I made you up inside my head”). Like the obsessive stalker of Ian McEwan’s Enduring Love, gripped by the delusional “erotomania” of happenstance, perhaps Márta has projected her own desires on to an unwitting subject. Or maybe, as her psychiatrist (Péter Tóth) suggests, the truth is even worse: that she longs for a diagnosis of madness to cover the altogether more mundane truth that the love of her life is actually just like all the rest: a liar, a cheat. Horvát has cited Truffaut and Kieślowski alongside Hitchcock as key influences (the spectre of Vertigo looms large). Yet the emotional tension of this seductive psychological romance reminded me unexpectedly of Guillaume Canet’s superb French adaptation of American novelist Harlan Coben’s thriller Tell No One. Impressively, Horvát manages to keep her narrative options open for far longer than should be credible (solutions can only disappoint), with Márta and János playing an unspoken game of cat and mouse as they follow each other through a city that seems to mirror and map her internal conflicts. One particularly audacious sequence, which Horvát cheekily calls “the first ‘love scene’”, finds Márta operating on the brain of a patient, only for János to walk into the theatre (the medical/theatrical interplay is pointed) and start “assisting”. Later, they fall into a spontaneous ritual of walking together on opposite sides of the street, with no words exchanged, just eloquent looks and glances. When János disappears on one such walk, we are left uncertain as to whether he was really there at all. Maybe we too have fallen into Márta’s trap of misremembering what we have seen. Or maybe János just took a different turn. Cinema has always been the perfect medium for exploring the elasticity of memory, with films implanting themselves in our consciousness like waking dreams (see David Lynch’s back catalogue for proof). Here, Horvát takes palpable pleasure in conjuring an uncanny world of ghosts, beautifully shot on 35mm by cinematographer Róbert Maly, who took inspiration from the photography of Saul Leiter, and hauntingly accompanied by Gábor Keresztes’s sparse score. But it’s Stork who carries the film, drawing us deep into Márta’s kaleidoscopic world, her piercingly quizzical expression challenging us to solve the puzzle of her experience, or perhaps daring us not to.

Here is a watchable, if slaveringly adulatory documentary profile of the yet-to-be-conclusively-identified artist, whose increasingly pricey work has spawned its own mini-industry of blokes with angle grinders chopping stencils off walls and doors almost before the paint is dry. Directed by Seamus Haley and Aurélia Rouvier, this film covers most of the bases: beginning with the 2018 shredding of his Girl With Balloon painting shortly after it had sold at auction, and working back through earlier greatest hits such as the Dismaland theme park, the Walled Off hotel in Bethlehem in the West Bank, and the Mobile Lovers gift to a Bristol youth club. It also very much bends the knee, allowing statements such as “Banksy is the Picasso of the 21st century” to pass through unchallenged; others may not subscribe entirely to this point of view. In lieu of much biographical information, quite a lot of the film is given over to entertaining speculation on Banksy’s identity: Massive Attack’s Robert del Naja, Tank Girl/Gorillaz illustrator Jamie Hewlett, and someone called Robin Gunningham, are all put forward as plausible candidates. (At one point a serial killer investigator gets involved; the vagueness of his conclusions doesn’t bode well for the state of the US justice system.) The backstroking and raptures do get a bit much, but the counterweight is provided by arguably the most interesting talking head: art dealer Robin Barton, who unembarrassedly talks about how he (legally) removed a number of artworks with the help of said angle-grinders – but met his Waterloo when wall-ownership issues scuppered the “preservation” of a stencil cut out from the side of an amusement arcade in Folkestone. (Though I am not quite sure how one commentator can stand up the idea that the picture was owned “emotionally” by Folkestone’s local population.) Well, even if you don’t sign up to Banksy’s genius, it’s fair to say he’s harnessed social media like no other artist, using it to authenticate his work, preserve his anonymity, and document his stunts – all of which has helped to inflate the monetary and cultural value of his output. And if Banksy wants to be the Keyser Soze of contemporary art, that’s his affair. It certainly sells tickets. • Banksy Most Wanted is released on 22 March on digital platforms.	444
Shot in Italy, with an English cast, there’s a crisp, almost fairytale levity to Alessio Liguori’s horror adventure that sits oddly but not unworkably with its gorier elements. It’s not quite clear exactly where it is set: perhaps actually in Italy, as the group of five youngsters being escorted on a red vintage bus are from an international school. Bantering with their driver, the party are jumped by a gun-toting convict when they stop to clear a dead deer off the road. But when the bus halts in a tunnel, with a shrouded shape huddled in front of them on the tarmac, they realise there’s worse out there. Liguori and writer Daniele Cosci don’t do much more than establish the character types of this Breakfast Club of teenagers: normals Nolan and Bess, swotty Queenie, joker Karl and bad boy Reggie. Not getting bogged down in interpersonal relationships means giving freer rein to the basic claustrophobia of their predicament, as their vehicle is menaced by a bulbous-headed beastie that looks a bit like William Blake’s Ghost of a Flea on crack. But Shortcut is not really tense: there’s a presiding zaniness that is almost cartoonish, with Zander Emlano’s Karl – whose lazy charm makes him the standout performer – especially game for screaming straight to camera. It’s one “yikes” away from being Scooby-Doo. Despite a rush of backstory when the gang hunker down in an abandoned fort and discover a cache of newspaper cuttings, the storytelling is a bit too scant and the runaround with the monster a bit too silly. But, delicately shooting all three environments – woods, bus and underground tunnels – with skin-prickling intensity, Shortcut retains a fresh edge. There is still the question of who the film is for: the close encounters with the pucker-mouthed parasite are too intense for kids. Maybe precocious tweens, or adults who are still afraid of the dark. • Shortcut is released on 29 March on digital platforms.	379
An artful hybrid of documentary and fiction, That Cloud Never Left zooms in on quotidian life in Daspara, a small West Bengal village where toys are made from reels of discarded film footage. The iconography is clear: these pieces of film are filled with nostalgia and longing, and now bear witness to the beauty and toil of manual labour. On the surface, That Cloud Never Left appears structurally fragmented, even opaque. There is an opening title that states that this is a work of fiction rather than a documentary; it is actually quite cheeky, considering that narrative is not a priority here, nor are any professional actors used. Instead, the film ditches linearity, and sees the villagers in fragments: a marital dispute over finances, a mother who waits for the monsoon, a boy searching for rubies in the forest. This mix of mundane life and magical daydreams lends an otherworldliness to this little village, as if the content of the cut-up film strips has seeped into everyday life. In visual terms, That Cloud Never Left is just as eclectic and experimental, alternating between straightforward scenes of toy-assembly with scans of the discarded strips where the images are scratched and intelligible. The sound mix contributes, too: the landscape murmurs, a static-heavy score disrupts, and the news on TV speaks of war and unrest, as well as an imminent eclipse. Out of the blue, dialogue and songs from old Hindi films sneak in. The symphony of these elements is exhilarating enough, but there’s more to be mined. The scrap film footage travels from wealthier Indian cities to be dumped on poor villages such as Daspara for recycling, meaning That Cloud Never Left becomes something more than a stylistic exercise in experimentation and nostalgia; there’s a hard economic reality here. • That Cloud Never Left is released on 26 March on True Story.	352
Here is a French New Wave pastiche that, like many others, emulates the style but retains none of the charm. The Drifters tries hard to blend the aesthetics of those 1960s classics with pressing issues of migration and racism. Alas, the poorly sketched characters render the film’s social concerns superficial at best and tone-deaf at worst. The Drifters follows a whirlwind romance between Fanny (Lucie Bourdeu), a French waitress, and Kofi (Jonathan Ajayi), an undocumented Senegalese migrant. After a meet-cute in an English class in London, Kofi sweeps Fanny away on a half romantic, half literal getaway trip to the seaside. Kofi has committed a robbery in exchange for an Irish passport – a better option than a British one in a post-Brexit world – and he is now on the run from both his boss Doog (Joey Akubeze) and the police. Like many Nouvelle Vague heroines, Fanny loves addressing the camera and breaking into dance. Unfortunately, such behavioural quirks swiftly become insufferable: she turns to the audience to muse on how she eats a lot but stays thin, and how commercials used to be so much better because of all the sex and violence. The Drifters is clearly clueless about the delicate dynamics of interracial romance: Fanny’s “cute” jokes with Kofi, which include asking if he has explosives in his bag and a “black people don’t swim” tease are downright mind-boggling. Even worse, the film has included a reprehensible trope in which Kofi befriends and redeems a white man (played by Jonjo O’Neill) who hurls racist abuse at him. In the end, Ajayi is The Drifters’ only saving grace; his heartfelt, sincere performance is the single beacon of substance in a stylish but hollow work. • The Drifters is released on 12 March on YourScreen.	347
In case you haven’t heard, they are making a movie about the making of the greatest movie ever made. No, not Citizen Kane – David Fincher covered that in Mank. Francis and The Godfather is about … (spoiler alert) … The Godfather. It looks to be a prestige affair. Directed by Barry Levinson and starring Jake Gyllenhaal (as producer Robert Evans), Elle Fanning (as his wife Ali MacGraw), Elisabeth Moss (Eleanor Coppola) and, as the 31-year-old Francis Ford Coppola, the indecently handsome Oscar Isaac. No wonder the real Coppola has given the project his blessing. Sure, there is a juicy tale to tell here: the wild-card casting of Marlon Brando, brushes with the mafia, the triumph of New Hollywood. But there is an uncomfortable circularity creeping in when it comes to movies about movies, like a snake eating its tail, or an industry that has run out of ideas and wants to cling to the past. There are strong incentives to do this. For one thing, actors love impersonating actors, and awards bodies love it, too. In recent years we have had acclaimed portrayals of Walt Disney (making Mary Poppins in Saving Mr Banks), Alfred Hitchcock (making Psycho in Hitchcock, making The Birds in The Girl), Marilyn Monroe (making The Prince and the Showgirl in My Week With Marilyn), and Jean-Luc Godard (Redoubtable – unlike Coppola, Godard called the movie “a stupid, stupid idea”). Plus jokier takes such as Eddie Murphy’s Dolemite Is My Name and James Franco’s The Disaster Artist (on cult atrocity The Room). Meanwhile, Mank finds itself in similar territory to the 1999 movie RKO 281, which was also about the making of Citizen Kane. From 8½ to Boogie Nights, Sullivan’s Travels to Singin’ in the Rain, fictional movies about film-making are some of the very best in cinema. True movie industry tales are never a chore: surely nothing in a Godfather making-of could match the chaos of Coppola’s Apocalypse Now shoot, as captured in the doc Hearts of Darkness. But when these stories are fictionalised and processed back through the machine that made them, they are prone to mythologising and general self-congratulation about how great Hollywood is. That will not be the case if things carry on in this vein. As well as a sign of creative bankruptcy, perhaps these movies represent a last stand for a system in which stars don’t matter as much as they used to. To compete with the likes of Marvel and Star Wars, Hollywood is effectively turning itself into a franchise. The snake is also running out of tail to eat. The Godfather was less than 50 years ago, The Room less than 20. So here’s hoping Francis and The Godfather goes very wrong. Maybe that will put a stop to this trend, or it will generate enough material for its own “making-of” movie down the line. Wonder who’ll play Oscar Isaac?	577
“What a mess! What a goddamn mess!” Real-life army general Joseph Stilwell (Robert Stack) says this, right when a car veers off the road and flips over on its side behind him, in the wild-as-hell second world war comedy 1941. While he’s describing the pandemonium that’s taking place on-screen, he’s also perfectly describing the movie as a whole. Fresh from inventing the summer blockbuster with Jaws, and following that up with the sci-fi mega-hit Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Steven Spielberg was officially the golden boy of new Hollywood. It seemed like as long as Spielberg was behind the camera, whatever he’s directing was gonna be an instant box office success. Working from a juvenile-on-purpose script (that was, believe it or not, based on real events where Americans raised a ruckus during the war) by longtime buddy John Milius, Bob Gale and future A-list film-maker Robert Zemeckis, Spielberg thought he would be doing an $11m comedy. The budget eventually ballooned to $35m (that’s $135m in today terms). Most of the cast – not just the actual funny people – wanted to play their characters loud and crazy. He soon found that making a bombastic comedy was something he was not equipped to do. “It’s too [expletive] tough,” he flat-out told Rolling Stone shortly after the movie’s release. When this self-proclaimed “comedy spectacular” was released in December 1979, it was greeted with savage reviews and meager box office receipts. Although it would go on to make $95m worldwide, it will forever be known as Spielberg’s first theatrical failure. As much of a comic pileup 1941 is, it’s still my favorite Spielberg. Maybe it’s because I discovered it at a young age where I watched Looney Tunes cartoons and Three Stooges shorts religiously and, when I wasn’t doing that, I was smashing toy cars together during playtime. As someone who got a kick out of witnessing the most hilariously cartoonish, destructive stuff, 1941 was right up my alley. Unlike most of Spielberg’s work, which is often earnest and serious, 1941 is straight-up silly. The movie begins in smart-ass meta fashion, with Susan Backlinie, AKA the skinny-dipping girl who was the first victim in Jaws, skinny-dipping again, but this time being picked up by the periscope of a Japanese submarine, en route to Los Angeles. Six days after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, the commander (that iconic Akira Kurosawa regular Toshiro Mifune) of this sub is looking for something stateside to hit. (Kudos to Spielberg for avoiding vilifying the Japanese, making them look just as lost and clueless as the people they’re going after.) Meanwhile, all the Angelenos are on edge, fearing they’ll be the first to get attacked. The most paranoid of them all is “Wild” Bill Kelso (John Belushi), a very unhinged, US army air corps captain flying his P-40 Tomahawk plane all over California, looking for the enemy and becoming a bigger menace than those guys on the sub. Honestly, most of the characters, especially those who are supposedly fighting for Uncle Sam, are a bit off their rockers, from Treat Williams’s egg-hating corporal to Warren Oates’s trigger-happy colonel to Nancy Allen’s military secretary, who gets off getting it on in warplanes. The only one who seems to have some marginal sense is Sergeant Frank Tree (Dan Aykroyd), who leads a tank crew (which includes future stars John Candy and Mickey Rourke) and tries to calm down a street full of fighting soldiers and sailors because he hates seeing “Americans fighting Americans”. That sense literally gets knocked out of him when a plastic Santa lands on his head, giving him a rather amusing concussion. The manic, satirical mayhem of 1941 seems more metaphorical and prescient now than it did when released. It shows Americans running around losing their minds when they think a threat is imminent, something you could say Americans have been doing ever since 9/11. For the past two decades, America has been filled with people worrying about outside forces taking over. Egged on by fearmongering politicians and Fox News propagandists, Maga hat-wearing men and women have continually prepared for some sort of invasion to show up and destroy democracy, the American dream, Christmas, etc. However, as the embarrassing storming of the Capitol – with clueless Trumpers wandering around, stealing stuff, smearing excrement on the walls and scaring many members of Congress into hiding – showed just a couple of months ago, the biggest threat to the United States is actually us. 1941 may be seen as a nonsensical farce to some, but it also may be the most fearless, American movie about national fear and panic ever made. 1941 is available to rent digitally in the US and the UK	934
Disney has announced that Black Widow and Cruella will both be debuting on its streaming service Disney+ at the same time as in cinemas. The Marvel adventure and 101 Dalmatians prequel had both been intended for traditional theatrical releases but with the box office still underperforming, the studio has made the decision for a hybrid release. “Today’s announcement reflects our focus on providing consumer choice and serving the evolving preferences of audiences,” said Kareem Daniel, chairman of Disney’s media and entertainment distribution. Both films will be part of the platform’s premier access service, which requires users to pay an additional $30 rental fee, the same model used for Mulan and, most recently, Raya and the Last Dragon, which some US exhibitors have refused to show because of the simultaneous release. Box office intake has slowly started to increase in the US, with cinemas reopening in New York City and Los Angeles, the two biggest markets in the country, but many national locations still remain closed and capacity limits mean that attendance remains low. The studio has also announced that Pixar’s summer film Luca will eschew any form of theatrical release in territories with Disney+, headed straight to the platform for no additional cost. The same strategy was used in December for Soul. Other films moved back by the company include Marvel’s Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, now opening in September, and the Agatha Christie adaptation Death on the Nile, now being released in February 2022. Cruella, starring Emma Stone as the titular villain, will be released on 28 May while Black Widow is scheduled to premiere on 9 July. The Scarlett Johansson adventure was initially scheduled for 1 May 2020 but has seen a number of shifts because of Covid-19. The news comes after Disney claimed its latest Marvel series, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, was its most watched Disney+ series premiere yet, beating The Mandalorian and WandaVision. The studio recently reported that the platform has over 100 million users in just 16 months of operation.	385
My friend Martin Freeth, who has died aged 76 of cancer, devoted his life to film-making, mainly on television. In 1995, he established the BBC Multimedia Centre, which gave the corporation a much needed boost into the online world. Martin was born in Cairo to Roseen (nee Preston), a librarian and careers adviser, and Andrew Freeth, a painter, engraver and Royal Academician, who both worked in intelligence in Egypt during the second world war. After the war the family moved to Northwood, north-west London, and Martin went to school at Marlborough college, Wiltshire, before moving on to Southampton University, where he met Averil Bagshaw, whom he married in 1966. After gaining a master’s degree in film and TV at the Royal College of Art, Martin joined the BBC science features department in 1971 and, over the next 24 years, produced 17 BBC Horizon programmes, including the pioneering documentary dramas Darwin’s Dream and The Intelligence Man, plus Finding a Voice, which won the Robert Kennedy film award. He also produced many Tomorrow’s World programmes and two international series, The Mind Machine with Colin Blakemore and The Trouble With Medicine. In 1995 he was appointed by the BBC’s deputy director general to establish the corporation’s Multimedia Centre. Martin had appreciated the significance of the internet early on, and without his enthusiasm and constant advocacy the corporation would have been slower to realise the importance of its potential online role. He assembled a remarkable team of specialists, with skills across technology, production, content creation, writing, design and audiovisual. Under his stewardship the team developed experimental interactive productions to test the potential of television in the coming digital age. This work was often done as so-called smart production – coordinating with other departments such as BBC Music and Arts and BBC Northern Ireland. The Multimedia Centre also developed a major iteration of the BBC website, which would go on to become BBC Online. Martin would not have regarded this as his most important contribution; nor his role as the first director of the At-Bristol Science Centre, now called We The Curious; nor being deputy director of Nesta (National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts), working with Lord (David) Puttnam during its foundation; and managing director of Futurelab. At heart he was a film-maker, and that was his passion. His filmography contains more than 200 credits as director/producer. At the end of his career he made films for the BMJ and Nature, for commercial companies when he believed in the project, and pro bono for numerous charities and local community groups. He was a kind and considerate manager, going out of his way to support people starting out in the industry. Averil died in 2019. He is survived by their daughters, Kate and Ellen, and his brothers, Tony and Richard.	544
Clearly intended as a leg-up in the ranks of the female action star for Gillian White, this smalltown revenge thriller starts off well but takes a fatally long time to gather momentum. White plays Zara, a successful lawyer in a desert town whose martial arts skills, courtesy of lethal-but-sensitive husband and dojo partner Brian (Michael Jai White, her real-life husband/trainer), make her a social media hit after she disarms a goon threatening a coffee-shop assistant. This lowlife is in fact part of a local human-trafficking ring, masterminded by chihuahua-loving hoodlum Patrick (Mickey Rourke), with links to Zara’s secret past. Any B-movie thriller worth its salt should get to its inciting incident within the first 20 minutes. Here, it’s the kidnapping of Zara and Brian’s daughter, and it takes nearly 50 minutes to arrive. The plot is jammed instead with portentous run-ins with Patrick’s thugs, leaden teasing-out of Zara’s history that hovers close to matinee melodrama, and only the sporadic justice-servings we are really here for. With a fierce crochet hook of a left eyebrow, White has a natural charisma and authority, and – with him indoors taking a back seat – ample room to strut them. Yet director Christian Sesma shoots her in a cramped way that prevents full butt-kicking glory, and she starts to become strangely decentred in her own film. Elsewhere, despite looking these days like a man trapped inside Mickey Rourke prosthetic makeup, Rourke has a rueful dignity in his few, largely static scenes that is hard to take your eyes off. • Take Back is released on 29 March on digital platforms.	307
A first feature from director of short films Devereux Milburn, co-written by Milburn and the film’s cinematographer-producer Dan Kennedy, this is a stylised, unsettling horror jaunt that plays interesting variations on an all-too-familiar plot premise. Sam and Riley, a good-looking couple in their 20s, played respectively by Sawyer Spielberg (yes, son of Steven Spielberg) and Malin Barr, takes the always foolish decision to leave the safety of the city for a camping trip. In this case, they elect to pitch their tent somewhere in rural New England because Riley is working on a doctoral thesis about a (fictitious) fungal infection in wheat that causes gangrene and madness in cows and people. However, they soon get run off their campsite by the local farmer (Stephen D’Ambrose), and a flat car battery forces them to seek help at the cluttered homestead of elderly Karen (Barbara Kingsley), a keen baker and cooker of meaty steaks, and her mute, brain-damaged son (Jamie Bradley). The city slickers soon find themselves at the mercy of ravenous desires; but on the plus side, all the TV sets seem to be perpetually tuned to the last station in the world showing nothing but old black and white Popeye and Betty Boop cartoons from the Inkwell Studios’ heyday in the early 1930s, a glorious period in animation, and a good match for the body horror that’s about to be revealed here. With a running time of 107 minutes, the film goes on just a little longer than it really needs to before it gets predictably violent, grotesque and reasonably scary at last. But Milburn and Kennedy certainly know how to build a unique atmosphere, using liverish lighting schemes, cantered camera angles, unsettling split screens, misleading editing and above all a truly disturbing soundtrack that combines source noise with composer John Mehrmann’s musical score – a mix of synthesizers, unsettling percussive bongs and bubble pops, and what sounds like a theremin having a very bad day. • Honeydew is released on 29 March on digital platforms.	388
At last, just what world cinema really needs right now: an exquisitely made film about street dogs in Istanbul, satiating that universal desire to see distant lands, coo over beautiful, noble animals, and satisfy the audience’s need to feel guilty about the misfortune of poorer, unluckier people. Director Elizabeth Lo’s first feature-length documentary ticks every box, while also providing a companion piece to Kedi, Ceyda Torun’s equally wonderful ode to Istanbul and Turkey’s feral felines. Together, the two films would make the perfect night in of viewing for quarantined animal lovers with frustrated wanderlust, especially anyone who loves the magnificently grotty Bosphorus metropolis. Filmed seemingly with a low-slung camera held for great chunks of the running time at dog-head height, the film follows a gaggle of orphans both canine and human whose paths intersect and converge. A trio of Turkish-speaking refugees from Syria live in squatted building sites and doorways, and the camera stands back and watches while they huff glue from bags and space out. The actual protagonist is a yellow mutt named Zeytin, a Labra-something cross probably, with the most soulful eyes you’ll see in any movie this year. Dragging a slightly crook leg and sometimes palling up with dog friend Nazar – a dark, stockier lady of a certain age – Zeytin hangs with the Syrian boys and then saunters off to look for food when the fancy takes her, queen of the road, blithely unconcerned about cars. The spliced-in grandiloquent quotes about dogs and philosophy and whatnot from Diogenes that pepper the film aren’t really necessary; the action speaks for itself. Perhaps because the star species here is more biddable and less camera-shy than the average cat, Lo’s film stays closer to its non-human heroine than Kedi did, creating a more lyrical, less anthropological study. That poetic vibe is richly enhanced by composer Ali Helnwein’s keening, cello-centric score that’s nimbly synched up to the editing. That said, nothing tops the vocal performance from Zeytin herself at the end, howling hauntingly along with a muezzin’s call to prayer. • Stray is released on 26 March on digital platforms.	408
“The truth is, I don’t actually like making films,” Terry Gilliam confesses in Keith Fulton and Lou Pepe’s He Dreams of Giants, their second (and better) feature-length look at Gilliam’s creative process. “It’s not a film, it’s a medical condition,” the director says about The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, which he began developing in 1989, got six days into production in 2000 before he was shut down, then had six other aborted starts before finally getting it done. “I have to empty my head,” he mumbles later, a faraway look in his eyes and medical tubes coming out of him. He will either conquer Quixote or Quixote will conquer him. Before anything else, yes, it is quite fitting that a mad, aged fabulist like Terry Gilliam will stop at nothing to revive the story of a Spanish shoemaker (Jonathan Pryce, in the final version), a mad, aged fabulist who stops at nothing to revive the legend of Don Quixote, the mad aged fabulist who will stop at nothing to revive the age of chivalric tales. Look up Quixotic in the dictionary and there’s Gilliam’s toothy grin. But part of what separates He Dreams of Giants from other from-the-trenches documentaries about difficult films (Burden of Dreams about Werner Herzog’s Fitzcarraldo and Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker’s Apocalypse about the madness of Apocalypse Now being the twin titans of the genre) is that once production actually starts … it isn’t all that bad. The toil and tumult is only inside the battered director’s head, encroaching on the space where his artistic confidence once lived. While Gilliam’s style is certainly not for everyone (his movies basically flatulate at you) most would agree there’s a distinctive “before and after” on his résumé. The early work includes the Monty Python era, then Time Bandits, Brazil, The Fisher King, 12 Monkeys and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. The recent work includes Tideland, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus and The Zero Theorem; movies that did not make much of a mark on film culture. In between is the gap, the absence of The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, the one that got away due to a domino effect of bad luck chronicled in Fulton and Pepe’s 2002 documentary Lost in La Mancha. There isn’t anything as cinematic as a flash flood in this newer film, but there still is that lifetime between thought and expression, as Lou Reed put it. Artistic constipation, is perhaps the more Gilliamesque phrase. Either way, with a lack of fireworks to work with, Fulton and Pepe try a different approach. I’ve never seen so many long shots of a man rubbing his temples with a look of horror on his face set to eerie music. Their film is a moody plunge into the anguish of the artistic process. One might read that and think, hey, come on, there are people out there in the world with real problems, why should I care that a septuagenarian film director is losing his mojo? By the end of this movie you’ll realize that Gilliam’s struggles are humanity’s struggles. One doesn’t need to have familiarity with motion picture production to understand the fears and frustration of trying to accomplish something. His momentary giggles of glee are bursts of oxygen. His (many) hurled F-bombs, growls and facepalms are the terror we all want to deny. For someone who works in fantasy, Gilliam has his feet surprisingly on the ground. He is extremely self-aware of how he is perceived, and is marinated in self-doubt. He must make this movie if he is to keep his sanity, but he knows that he will never make it as good as it is in his mind. No matter what he does, he says, it will be a disappointment. It’s rather tragic because, let’s face it, he’s right. This is one of those curious examples of the movie about the movie is more dramatic and more gripping than the movie itself. It hurts me to say that; I already had tremendous respect for Gilliam watching this. After watching him fight for his passions, I absolutely love him. There are, of course, a handful of critics who really love The Man Who Killed Don Quixote. If nothing else, this film has inspired me to see it a second time. Never stop dreaming. He Dreams of Giants screened at the DOC NYC festival and will be released in the UK on 29 March on digital platforms.	891
Here is the second feature from Juris Kursietis, a Latvian film-maker working in a toughly questioning European social-realist style. Valentin Novopolskij plays Oleg, a young migrant worker from Riga working in a meat processing plant in Ghent, Belgium. A grisly accident means that he is danger of losing the job and getting deported, but poor, biddable Oleg falls under the sway of a sinister Polish gangmaster called Andrzej, who genially offers to get him a fake Polish passport and fix him up with cash-in-hand building work with all the other eastern European illegals . They are all living together, drinking and playing Fifa in a house that they are supposed to be remodelling – but the mercurial and voluble Andrzej is in fact terrorising them like an abusive stepfather and using them in violent crime. Andrzej is played by Dawid Ogrodnik, whom I last saw as the sax-playing hitchhiker in Paweł Pawlikowski’s Ida. This is a bleakly uncompromising film, shot in a handheld manner, the camera shakily following Oleg closely around in the streets, the building sites and the various chaotic and squalid interiors. But it’s leavened with a kind of black comedy: Oleg ends up having sex with a young woman during a somewhat unlikely interlude, by conning his way into a private party and pretending to be an actor, and the realism is interspersed with dream-like and religiose sequences. Interestingly, movies like this about the marginal, the exploited and the dispossessed usually have a young woman at their heart rather than a man, and this shows how there is a very masculine sort of humiliation and despair in Oleg’s heart. He has a connection with Andrzej’s abused girlfriend, Małgosia (Anna Próchniak), and it is easy to see how Oleg’s life is playing out in a kind of gender-switch parallel to hers. I’m not sure I quite believed the way in which this story is played out, but there is an abrasive energy to it. • Oleg is released on 23 March on Mubi.	379
The director John Sheedy’s coming of age film H is For Happiness – adapted from Barry Jonsberg’s novel My Life As an Alphabet – is photographed in joyfully bright ways, as if inspired by the aesthetic of boiled lollies or rainbow-coloured cupcakes. The juicy, irresistible look of the film evokes the child in the adult, while its narrative – about an idiosyncratic 12-year-old girl intent on solving the world’s problems, including and especially those in her own family – evokes the adult in the child. There is plenty for youngsters to mull over without feeling like they’ve been talked down to or lectured. The freckled, cherub-faced Candice (an unforgettably vibrant Daisy Axon), with her Pippi Longstocking-like bright white teeth and pigtailed red hair, is the sort of character who is compulsively watchable on screen but would probably come across as an insufferable do-gooder in real life. This is suggested early in the piece, when Candice’s school teacher Miss Bamford (Miriam Margolyes) asks if any of the students have questions about their assignment. And, of course, Candice does, drawing from the class a big collective sigh; they have been in this situation before. A new boy at her school becomes Candice’s bestie and potential love interest. He is Douglas Benson (Wesley Patten), whose full name, according to Candice, is “Douglas Benson from Another Dimension”. She has bestowed upon him this title because Douglas does indeed claim to have travelled between planes of reality, while simultaneously conceding that his experiences in “manipulating dimensions and invoking gravity” is a gloried way of saying he fell out of a tree. While delivering his backstory about crossing dimensions, Douglas complains about how “some idiot in a white coat” made an “unscientific” and “frankly, insufferable” diagnosis that he is mentally unwell. No child speaks like that, of course. Nor does anybody – child or adult – express themselves with the kind of magniloquence that comes out of Candice’s mouth. “Your vocabulary is remarkable for a 12-year-old,” her teacher says, highlighting an observation no doubt made by the audience. The silver-tongued youngster responds by explaining that her favourite book is the dictionary and she reads it every night. The contrivance of the film’s dialogue might have been in issue in, say, a social realist picture with a gritty street-side vibe. H is for Happiness is a very different experience, its bright syrupy surfaces the most obvious manifestation of a movie that, while more or less based in our world, has its head very much in the clouds, with regular inferences of the fantastical. What do we make, for instance, of the small and beautiful white horse that follows Candice and Douglas into the forest, and seems to have walked right out of a picture book? And do we think that Douglas Benson might actually be from another dimension? The cinematography of Bonnie Elliott (who recently shot The Hunting, Palm Beach and Undertow), with its rainbow colours and high saturation, also infers magical qualities. Her gloss-lacquered surfaces are aided in no small measure by Nicki Gardiner’s production design, Terri Lamera’s costume design and Marita Mussett’s art direction. H is for Happiness looks like the sort of film people had a lot of fun making. Sheedy deploys truckloads of one-point perspective shots, directing viewers to the centre of symmetrical compositions. The contemporary film-maker most closely associated with this type of image is the auteur Wes Anderson, who, like Sheedy, does not see any conflict between dramatic and emotional truth and sweet-toothed visual artifice. H is for Happiness even dabbles in overhead food photography – another distinct Andersonism. This, and the enchanting 2016 coming of age dramedy Girl Asleep, are probably the most Wes Anderson-like films in Australian history. The word “quirky” comes to mind – though this a very fussy, fastidious kind of quirk, heavy on visual artistry and with a high-end, ’grammable sort of incandescence. The lollipop look of H is for Happiness suggests viewers are observing this world through the optimistic eyes of a child, which makes for a particularly interesting experience when Lisa Hoppe’s screenplay confronts the emotional affairs of adults. Candice’s father Jim (Richard Roxburgh) and uncle Brian (Joel Jackson), for instance, do not get along and have deep wounds to heal. And her mother Claire (Emma Booth) is prone to episodes of melancholia, sometimes seen staring glumly into the distance. She must see her world in despairing monochrome. The narrative arc builds towards a school theatre production, which is a cliche drag-and-drop conclusion. But it’s done in a way that’s hard if not impossible to hate, utilising the old trick of making poo jokes to diffuse sentimentality. There is much to appreciate in this film; much to like. You don’t just watch it in big bright colours; you remember it in big bright colours too. •H is for Happiness is released in the UK on 29 March on digital platforms.	963
Cristi Puiu is the film-maker who spearheaded Romanian new wave 15 years ago with his brilliant The Death of Mr Lazarescu, and then five years later with his dauntingly opaque existential drama Aurora, and after that the strange Sieranevada – the intimate study of a family gathered to honour the death of a father. These realist dramas, considered together, were intelligibly the product of one film-maker in a recognisable – if difficult – style. Ten years ago, in fact, Puiu was talking about a projected “suite” of six such tales, and these appeared to be the first three. His new feature, however, could not be more different. It is an almost impossibly stark, austere, cerebral and verbose film, running at three hours and 20 minutes, populated by the leisured classes of a distant age. Almost a sequence of theatrical tableaux, it is set in a grand country house in Transylvania at the end of the 19th century and inspired by – rather than conventionally adapted from – the Russian philosopher Vladimir Solovyov’s 1915 text War and Christianity: Three Conversations. This is a film of formidable and almost intimidating seriousness, which is admirable and refreshing in its way, but it does not make many concessions to anything as vulgar as entertainment or even drama (as that might be vulgarly conceived). The guests include a decorated general, a nobleman, a politician and various aristocratic ladies; these people, in their faultless period clothing, address each other with studied formality, but often with a kind of controlled, eloquent passion. In the opening act, as they prepare for luncheon, the talk is of God and man, about humanity’s destiny, about science and progress, about how warfare – once the key practice of patriotism and nobility – is evil. The concept of a Christian warrior is fiercely condemned and defended, as is the concept of Christian forgiveness in the face of violence. The general has sent the hostess a horrifying letter about how ecstatically justified he felt in slaughtering the godless Ottomans during the Russo-Turkish War, because they had been guilty of barbarities on the field of battle. After lunch they debate the realpolitik of retreating from Russian pride and exceptionalism, the merits of reaching an accommodation with the English and subsuming their Russianness into a European identity, or conceding that they are European with an “Asian” sediment and might even undertake to spread this “Europeanness” all over the world. The burden of empire leads the company to consider the British and their African conquests, and there is a defence of culture as an unashamedly elitist treasure. At dinner, one of the ladies restates her radical Tolstoyan conviction that the church has eroded the real values of faith, that the Resurrection is a myth, and that the spirit of the Gospels must reside in combating evil with non-violence. She is countered by the high-born gentleman, who has a copy of the New Testament to hand, which he expounds with a tiny thread of antisemitism. Beneath all this talk, there are strange hints of illness and below-stairs discontent, and at one stage the high-flown talk is interrupted by the sound of what appears to be jazz on a gramophone from another room. Then there is a deeply strange seismic eruption. It seems as if all this talk could be a big Buñuelian joke, or a satiric comment on the cosseted arrogance of the ruling class. All the guests had, after all, been contemplating catastrophe, sombrely contemplating the horror of abolishing God – perhaps like Ivan Karamazov in Dostoevsky’s novel, taunted by Satan for his intellectual braggadocio in saying that all is permitted if God does not exist, and then spiritually stricken when his father is murdered. Weirdly, the moment passes, though it is followed by an ambiguous silent sequence in the snow outside, perhaps representing a funeral or commemorative ceremony, and when the group discussion resumes it is so calm that you might think it takes place at some sort of reunion months or years later. Is it supposed to be a dream? I’m not sure. For all that this film has something exasperatingly opaque and inert about it, it has an uncompromising insistence that ideas matter. These people’s thoughts, although debatable, are not simply presented as absurd. Malmkrog is a long, demanding experience – a real festival event. But that bizarre dreamlike eruption lives on in the mind. •Malmkrog is released in the UK on 26 March on digital platforms.	844
In Violation’s closing stretch, Miriam (Madeleine Sims-Fewer) sits numbly in a rain-lashed car and watches a man harangue his wife in an eastern European language. Miriam has just done something unspeakable, in reaction to something unforgivable; preparing to finish the job at an anonymous motel, it is as if she has crossed a border into a foreign country. But the couple in front of her show the inescapable constant: male violence. Building to a remorseless climax, Sims-Fewer and co-writer/director Dusty Mancinelli brilliantly, and times almost unwatchably, overhaul the rape-revenge movie as something far more realistic, traumatised and noxious. Miriam has come from London to visit her sister Greta (Anna Maguire) in the Canadian forest idyll she shares with husband Dylan (Jesse LaVercombe). But tension is in the air: in Miriam’s faltering marriage with Caleb (Obi Abili), in her jealousy of her sister, even in the disturbing flashes of nature – pond lice seething on the lake – that open the film. Able only to unburden herself to the seemingly matey Dylan, Miriam stupidly kisses him by the campfire; then when she is sleeping, he rapes her. Sims-Fewer and Mancinelli don’t show this event immediately, opting for non-linear disorientation that cuts between that night and a later hook-up in a log cabin in which Miriam ties Dylan naked to a chair, and asks for his side of the story. What follows is possibly the most brutal woman-on-man ordeal since Audition. But there is nothing triumphal about it; this isn’t some fantasy spree, just a single abject act of reprisal. The violence, and the torrent of suppressed rage and disgust it unleashes, are appalling. When the rape is finally shown, it is in tiny glimpses of chilled napes and heaving eyelids. Trying to utterly destroy Dylan’s body is Miriam’s response to the invasion of her own, and this corporeal tragedy plays out in Sims-Fewer’s staggering physical commitment to the role. Outside the motel, her face becomes a glistening mask; a fury in the classical Greek sense. Misogyny remains current, but this stony rejoinder – with nature shot as if out of kilter, or possibly amplified – feels like something from the ancient world. • Violation is released on 25 March on Shudder.	435
For any vaguely fit actor over the age of 50, being given your own Taken was briefly seen as an enviable career boost, a chance to relive former glories, a slickly choreographed leap from an early Hollywood grave back to the sandlot. Ever since Liam Neeson swapped emoting for punching back in 2008, Kevin Costner, Sean Penn, John Travolta, Pierce Brosnan and Guy Pearce all tried to do the same but audiences wisely stayed away from their sub-par shoot-em-ups and execs were forced to realise that, duh, it’s the star rather than the sub-genre that people are magnetically drawn to. Because Neeson’s shtick was continuing to bring in solid crowds while his peers were flailing and in 2014, Keanu Reeves found a similar sweet spot with John Wick, kicking off a hugely profitable new series with a Taken-adjacent combination of simple action plot and much-loved actor. With a burning desire for some of that Wick cash (the three films in total have made over $550m worldwide with a spin-off and TV series also planned), Universal has teamed up with the film’s writer Derek Kolstad to crack open what’s clearly hoped to be a new low-budget, high-profit action universe. This time the choice of lead is based less on conventional desirability and more on unconventional durability with Better Call Saul’s Bob Odenkirk as an unassuming suburban dad hiding a dark past in Nobody, a furiously entertaining thriller that, for me, worked far more effectively than any of Keanu’s outings, a bit more character thrown in to cushion the many broken bones. The unusual career of Odenkirk, who in his 50s has experienced an unlikely transformation from “oh that guy” character actor to Emmy-nominated lead of a hit show, makes him a compelling action hero, confident enough to command yet with a skillset that’s more extensive and more versatile than just pure physicality. He plays the improbably named Hutch Mansell, a milquetoast everyman whose daily routine has grown as tired as his chilly marriage. When his house is set upon by a couple of low-rent thieves, he’s set on a mission to right a wrong, revealing an adeptness for violence that’s been kept far away from his family. It’s a film cooked up from some overly familiar ingredients (as well as the blood and bullets, there’s challenged masculinity, the Russian mob, a cute pet, some noirish voiceover etc) yet Kolstad, along with Hardcore Henry director Ilya Naishuller on vibrant form, finds a way to make it all feel oddly vital. There’s a simple, shaggy charm to watching Hutch rediscover his particular set of skills, kicked off by a fantastically well-designed bus sequence that sees him scrappily take on a group of obnoxious younger men. He’s an imperfect yet resilient fighter, believably hampered by age, making him a character far more thrilling to watch than say, any one of Neeson’s no-stakes superheroes. The escalation that follows which dominoes one good deed into one savage fight into something far greater helps Nobody avoid the storytelling-by-numbers trap that so many revenge films often fall into, mimicking a video game with the hero going from one end-of-level boss to the next. The fight scenes are also awfully effective, a jolt of brutal violence captured with a specificity that allows us to keep up with every punch and kick, a base-level competency that so many action films fail to master. Perhaps the film’s greatest ace is its relative lack of smugness, Kolstad’s script briskly racing ahead without wasting time to stand back and remark on how smart and ironic it all is, quips kept to a minimum, a lesson other action screenwriters could do with learning. Odenkirk is a surprisingly physically adept anchor and while sure, the trope of a man only really being a man when he embraces his violent side is … not great, he tries his best to work around the regressive nature of the genre, turning Hutch into a man somewhat earnestly trying to figure out the right balance of alpha and beta. There’s little to do for Connie Nielsen as his confused wife but Christopher Lloyd gets to have some fun as his gun-toting father and along with RZA as his equally armed brother, there’s an intriguing little family dynamic that will probably be explored in the inevitable sequel (Nobodies, perhaps?). It’s all very been here, seen that yet there’s something infinitely pleasing about a film doing very little but doing it very well, knowing just how high to aim without aiming any higher, aware of exactly what it can and can’t do. In a tight 91 minutes, without any bloat, Nobody gives us exactly what we want. Nobody is out in US cinemas on 26 March with a UK release in June	911
If Towie put out a crime special it might look a bit like this shoddy London thriller about an ageing gangster whose plans for a peaceful retirement go south. The characters have that same style of stiff, awkward delivery, as if they’re speaking lines to each other over a dodgy Zoom link. The star is TV mainstay Billy Murray (The Bill and EastEnders) who plays John Morgan, a gang boss with the telltale mahogany suntan of a cockney hardman done good. Morgan, semi-retired in Turkey, flies into London on a private jet for a charity fundraiser. But on the night there’s a spot of bovver with an old foe, alcoholic detective Frank Conway (Nick Moran). Morgan and his wife Sadie (Jeanine Nerissa Sothcott) have also arranged a dinner to meet their Instagram influencer daughter’s new girlfriend – and there’s a horrifically sleazy scene when the girlfriend arrives early to find Sadie wearing only knickers. Murray plays villain Morgan with the menace of a bag of spinach wilting soggily at the back of the fridge – it’s almost as if his contract has stipulated a charisma bypass is a condition for the part. And everything is let down by the script, which feels cobbled together from geezerish cliches. “You’re like a British bulldog,” an associate growls at Morgan. “You’re proud, defiant, tenacious, old-school. But there comes a time in every animal’s life when it needs to be put down.” In the third act, the family dinner party turns into a home invasion nightmare that is an ordeal for all the wrong reasons. Meanwhile, copper Conway is downing whiskies in a gentrified East End boozer, getting all riled up for revenge. A twist at the end of the meal is ludicrous. In cockney rhyming slang, this is pony and trap. • Nemesis is released on 29 March on digital platforms.	364
“An empire of misogyny” is how former Irish president Mary McAleese described the Catholic church – and Christianity as a historical perpetrator of sexism and violence against women adds an interesting-ish layer or two to this otherwise run-of-the-mill but well-acted haunted-house horror. It’s set in the runup to the second world war and loosely inspired by Borley Rectory, the country manor once dubbed “the most haunted house in England”. Downton Abbey’s Jessica Brown Findlay is terrific as Marianne, a vicar’s wife with a rebellious streak (her bohemian “loose woman” past becomes crucial later). Marianne has just moved into a crumbling pile in the Essex countryside with her wet blanket husband Linus (John Heffernan) and their young daughter Adelaide (Anya McKenna-Bruce). The local bishop Malachi (John Lynch), a man who wears the huge gold cross around his neck like gangster’s bling, is clearly not to be trusted. And pretty soon things are going clank in the night. The film’s scares feel pretty standard, with nothing new to add to the gothic haunted house canon. Marianne hears voices wailing in the walls; her daughter finds a creepy Victorian doll with gaping black holes where its eyes have been gouged out. Nevertheless, director Christopher Smith turns the screws with malevolent precision: scenes in which Marianne and little Adelaide see their doppelgangers reflected in a mirror are genuinely unnerving, as are Marianne’s violent hallucinations. It all gets very silly, and there’s a naff go-nowhere storyline involving Nazis. But Brown Findlay holds it together with her performance of Marianne as the sort of woman who marches no-nonsense into the dark basement brandishing a torch to take on the ghosts of mad monks. • The Banishing is released on 26 March on digital platforms.	338
George Segal was the handsome, easy-going, romantic comedy player of the 1970s, pretty much the male equivalent of Goldie Hawn, with whom he starred in the 1976 western romp The Duchess and the Dirtwater Fox. His A-list Hollywood career began and ended with the decade itself and, in a way, defined the 1970s, or at least a part of it. He had a string of leading-man roles opposite top leading ladies, including Glenda Jackson, Barbra Streisand, Jane Fonda, Goldie Hawn, Jacqueline Bisset and Natalie Wood – before he got embroiled in a nasty legal dispute with producer-director Blake Edwards over dropping out of his comedy 10. This briefly soured his reputation in the film business, ended his hot streak and ushered in another shooting star of Hollywood romantic comedy, Dudley Moore. While the moody presences of the Hollywood new wave, such as Robert De Niro, Warren Beatty and Al Pacino, might have entranced critics, Segal’s light, dapper touch with funny and romantic dialogue was endearing to heartland moviegoers, who preferred entertainment at the frothier end of the spectrum. Segal was the kind of good-natured and presentable actor the Hollywood studio system used to produce, and still did – only now the men came with longish feather-cut hairstyles and Coppertone tans. Like Steve Martin, Segal was a sure-fire hit on late-night TV talk shows thanks to his genial sense of fun and goofy way of playing the banjo. One of Segal’s best performances, however, was for new wave auteur Robert Altman, in the 1974 film California Split, a dark buddy movie, with Elliot Gould, about two men who bond over their shared passion for – and addiction to – gambling. Segal shared something else with Gould when his time at the top of the movies came to an end: just as Gould became famous in the 90s to TV audiences as Monica’s dad in Friends, George Segal found his own second act as the roguish silver fox on TV shows such as Just Shoot Me! and The Goldbergs. Segal’s breakthrough came in the atypically serious and perhaps typically theatrical role of Nick in Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? in 1966, playing a young biology professor who, with his wife, arrives at a dinner party and finds himself caught in the drunken hosts’ marital crossfire. Segal coolly held his own against the deafening histrionics of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. He was also an amoral black-marketeer in Bryan Forbes’s second world war satire King Rat (1965), one of the blood-spattered mobsters in Roger Corman’s The St Valentine’s Day Massacre (1967) and a thief in the caper The Hot Rock (1972) alongside Robert Redford. But his real skills were revealed in other movies, such as Carl Reiner’s cult black comedy Where’s Poppa? (1970) about a harassed middle-aged man trying to euthanise his ageing mother by scaring her to death, and the syrupy romcom Blume in Love (1973). But the apotheosis of the Segal’s career and the veritable definition of his brand, came with A Touch of Class in 1973, in which he played a jetsetting married American businessman who comes to London and is entranced by the haughtily gorgeous Glenda Jackson, known to American audiences for her Emmy-award-winning performance as Elizabeth I (beamed into US homes on PBS’s Masterpiece Theater). They had what everyone agreed was chemistry, and the title was ironic and yet not ironic. The characters’ chaotic and wisecrackingly absurd (and extramarital) affair was anything but classy – yet there was real love there, with the blue-blood Brit conferring class on Segal, whose essential decency conferred it right back. This is the movie from Segal’s heyday that has dated the most; his cheeky ladies-man routine was always an inch away from being a little seedy and dandruffy, and his later comedy with Natalie Wood, The Last Married Couple in America, is another Hollywood attempt to stay relevant in the era of the sexual revolution, with a hint of swinging. Posterity may tend to favour Segal’s darker, non-romcom material: the sci-fi thriller The Terminal Man for director Mike Hodges in 1974 and Altman’s gambling drama. Segal is Hollywood’s forgotten star, a super-celeb whose stock price plunged in the Reagan era but who worked continuously in the decades that followed his golden era: cameos in comedies such as Flirting With Disaster and The Cable Guy, and a weird, uncredited walk-on in Gus Van Sant’s To Die For. It was TV, not the movies, that could absorb his image transition into twinkle-eyed, lovably incorrigible oldster. But in A Touch of Class, California Split and The Terminal Man, George Segal was the face of the Hollywood 1970s.	904
This contrived, nasty and uninteresting horror-thriller is a waste of its star Eddie Marsan. He plays Jarvis Dolan, a late-night radio presenter of lefty views, sort of like James O’Brien, with a bit of Piers Morgan’s provocation. His career is in crisis, having only just survived a kidnapping from a shadowy group of Brexity rightwing extremists. The station’s oleaginous boss Norman (a cameo from Anthony Head) insists that Jarvis now lightens the broadcasting mood by getting reunited with his old double-act partner, Andrew Wilde (played by Peaky Blinders’ Paul Anderson), a boozy, jokey wild man that Jarvis can’t stand these days. But hardly have they got together for their first show than they are attacked by terrifying masked individuals who lock them in the studio, forcing them to stay on the air, because they are obsessed with a certain something in Jarvis and Andrew’s past. All the buildup turns out to be tiringly irrelevant to the attack itself, which revolves around an event from 10 years ago, in circumstances that don’t seem at all convincing for people who are supposed to be late-night radio presenters, not rock stars. The movie is supposed to deliver claustrophobic tension and thrills, a little like Assault on Precinct 13, perhaps. But there is a weird lack of plausible plot involvement, and also a disconcerting amount of implausible plot development. Who would have thought that a radio studio actually had a sort of trapdoor in the side leading to possible escape from the building? And then there are flourishes of horrible violence that don’t mesh with the rest of the film. You might find yourself tuning out. • Feedback is released on 26 March on digital platforms.	329
Bertrand Tavernier, the veteran French director of a host of acclaimed films including A Sunday in the Country, Round Midnight and These Foolish Things, has died aged 79. The news was announced by the Institut Lumière, the film organisation of which he was president. No cause of death was given. Tavernier’s output was prolific: he made his directorial debut in 1974 with The Clockmaker of St Paul and worked continuously until 2013, when he released his final feature film, The French Minister. He also took in a wide variety of material, from crime and noir, to comedy, jazz and historical drama. Born in Lyon in 1941, Tavernier was the son of magazine publisher René Tavernier, whose anti-Nazi principles would greatly influence Bertrand. Like the generation of French New Wave directors that slightly preceded him, Tavernier grew up as a film obsessive; having moved to Paris after the war, he founded his own magazine and managed to get a job as an assistant director to Jean-Pierre Melville on the 1961 film Léon Morin, Prêtre. By his own admission, he was so bad as an AD that Melville instead made him the publicist for its follow-up, Le Doulos. It was in this role that Tavernier made his first mark in the film industry, working as a publicist on a series of New Wave classics, including Jean-Luc Godard’s Contempt and Agnés Varda’s Cleo de 5 à 7. “We were the first film publicists who were film buffs – we only accepted the films we liked,” he told the Guardian in 2008. However, it was always Tavernier’s ambition to break into directing, and returned to Lyon to make an adaptation of the Georges Simenon novel The Watchmaker of Everton, starring Philippe Noiret, the lugubrious looking actor who would go on to be a regular collaborator. Noiret appeared in Tavernier’s next film, the period drama Let Joy Reign Supreme about an 18th century rebellion against the crown, which won four Césars, the French equivalent to the Oscars. Tavernier’s interest in American crime literature was demonstrated with films such as Coup de Torchon (1981), adapted from Jim Thompson’s Pop. 1280, and starred Noiret opposite Isabelle Huppert; it was nominated for the best foreign language film Oscar. However, Tavernier’s major international breakthrough was the A Sunday in the Country (1984), a fin-de-siècle-set drama about an elderly painter whose family come to visit; it won wide acclaim and a string of awards, including best director at the Cannes film festival. Tavernier followed it up with what remains arguably his best-known film: Round Midnight, released in 1986, which starred Dexter Gordon as a jazz musician struggling to survive in Paris and New York. Tavernier had more success with Life and Nothing But, with Noiret as a military investigator after the first world war, and then These Foolish Things, for which he persuaded Dirk Bogarde to come out of retirement for a drama about the relationship between a dying man and his scriptwriter daughter (played by Jane Birkin). In the 90s, Tavernier made well-received crime films L.627 and The Bait, as well as glossy swashbuckler Revenge of the Musketeers, starring Sophie Marceau. In 2002 Tavernier turned to the French film industry itself as a subject with Safe Conduct, based on a memoir by Jean Devaivre and focusing on the Nazi occupation. However, Devaivre fell out with Tavernier, and the director found himself accused by French critics of attacking the New Wave. In 2009, Tavernier finally realised his ambition of making a Hollywood thriller: the Louisiana-set In the Electric Mist was adapted from a novel by James Lee Burke and starred Tommy Lee Jones as Burke’s detective Dave Robicheaux. However, the experience was not a happy one; Tavernier told the Guardian that he “found everything more difficult than working in France”, and while the film was selected for the Berlin film festival, it was not released in US cinemas. Back on home ground, the breadth of Tavernier’s enthusiasm for film was showcased in his lengthy 2016 documentary My Journey Through French Cinema, in which he expanded on film-makers such as Melville, Jacques Becker and Robert Bresson.	794
The Curzon cinema chain is considering offering movie-goers the option of attending screenings reserved exclusively for customers who have proof of a Covid-19 vaccine – alongside screenings where no jab is required. The announcement came as debate intensified over whether venues such as pubs and nightclubs will require customers to be inoculated. Philip Knatchbull, chief executive of the 21-strong Curzon chain, said giving customers a choice would avoid having to impose a blanket rule, which could trigger legal issues around discrimination. “Personally, I am not a supporter,” said Knatchbull. “It is extremely difficult to monitor and more importantly it would prejudice against the minority of people who don’t get a vaccine. “We may get around that by having some screenings where people may need proof of vaccination and some that don’t. We are trying to think how to make our customers comfortable and how our brand should be best reflected by offering flexibility.” He said he was in talks with the UK Cinema Association (UKCA), which represents most cinema owners across the country, and the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, and that Curzon has yet to come to a final decision. Under Boris Johnson’s roadmap to ease coronavirus restrictions through the summer cinemas will be allowed to reopen from 17 May, unless the pandemic situation deteriorates. The prime minister has set a target of vaccinating every adult by the end of July. However, certain groups will miss out, including women who are pregnant and children, potentially making them ineligible for entry to venues if a blanket ban is imposed. The biggest three UK cinema chains – Cineworld, Vue and Odeon – all declined to comment specifically on whether they were considering offering separate screenings. Knatchbull’s tentative plan may provide a workable blueprint for the wider industry, which is against being forced to check vaccination status and bar people from entry. There is “widespread opposition” across the industry to the idea that people might be required to show evidence of a vaccination or negative test before being allowed into a cinema, the UKCA said. “Even when the current vaccine rollout is complete, there will still be significant numbers of people who will not have been vaccinated,” said Phil Clapp, UKCA chief executive. “These include pregnant women, people with certain disabilities or underlying conditions and young people aged 18 and under. Making proof of vaccination a condition of entry to a cinema will potentially introduce significant issues of discrimination under the Equalities Act 2010.” He added that such a system would also make the financial recovery of the cinema sector, which at the start of last year comprised almost 850 cinemas across the UK, much more difficult. Their pandemic-enforced closure for much of last year resulted in admissions in the UK slumping to the lowest level since records began in 1928. Similarly, the box office take in the UK and Ireland totalled just £307m last year, a year-on-year decrease of more than 80%, the lowest take in three decades. The parlous state of the industry was highlighted on Thursday when Cineworld, the largest cinema operator in the UK and second biggest globally, reported a record $3bn (£2.2bn) loss for 2020.	602
As you are all no doubt aware, the real losers of the Covid era are the awards ceremonies. Once the height of impossible glamour, they have now been relegated to asking that nominees dress up to the nines, just to sit in their own living room and deliver sub-par reaction shots into a laptop webcam. The Grammys were small and uninteresting. The Golden Globes were full of awkward technical hitches. The Oscars had originally promised a “no Zoom” policy this year, but are quickly learning just how hard it is to force nominees to travel internationally during a pandemic, only to sit for hours and hope for an award they’re unlikely to win. Now it has emerged that the Baftas will be doing without Graham Norton this year. Instead, hosting duties will be split between Dermot O’Leary, Edith Bowman and Clara Amfo. What’s more, the ceremony will be split across two days, with Amfo giving out eight awards on 10 April, and O’Leary and Bowman doing the rest the following night. The loss of Norton seems like a loss of authority. Hosting an awards show is a difficult thing to get right: you’re at once pitching your performance to people in the auditorium, many of whose careers will be changed by a win, and millions of people at home, who just want to see what everyone is wearing. Which is why the ceremony traditionally likes to glom on to its favourites. This millennium has only featured six Bafta hosts; Stephen Fry has hosted 11 times, Jonathan Ross five. There have been a couple of misfires – Jack Docherty hosted in 2000, and the truly berserk anti-comedy of Joanna Lumley meant that she wasn’t invited back after hosting in 2018 and 2019 – but Norton felt like a staple after his stint last year. I was in the Albert Hall for last year’s ceremony, and his performance was expertly judged. His jokes were barbed without being spiteful, his sincere moments actually seemed sincere and, most importantly, he understood the importance of economy. This was his first shot at hosting the film Baftas, but it felt like he’d been doing it all his life. That might be because he had long been a mainstay of their television counterparts, hosting them in 2005, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2019. But, again, he wasn’t there last year for the hastily assembled part-remote lockdown TV Baftas. There, the glory went to Richard Ayoade, who was an inspired choice to hosts an awards show in what basically amounted to a massive void. Ayoade brought a much-needed dose of self-aware, “This is all a bit crap, isn’t it?” smarts to proceedings. Chances are he’d fare less well at a flesh-and-blood ceremony, which traditionally calls for a little less nuance and a little more sincerity, but he couldn’t have been better for the weirdness of 2020. Perhaps that’s the rationale behind the hiring of O’Leary, Bowman and Amfo. This won’t be a normal awards show. There will be no fidgety huddle of A-list stars 10 feet away from the stage. There will be no breathless red carpet event to cover. It won’t be an event that needs hosting in the traditional sense. Instead, it sounds like more of a magazine format, with the hosts simply throwing between items. And if that’s the case, why not hire the people who are best at throwing between items? The big question is whether Norton will return to host the Baftas next year. It sounded very much like this was a temporary arrangement “Bafta loves working with Graham Norton,” a spokesperson told the Sun. “He was a great host last year. We have a very successful working relationship with him across both the film and TV awards and have done for a number of years.” So maybe he’ll be back. Then again, given the uncertain future of public life post-Covid and the spectacular way that award show ratings have cratered over the past 12 months, maybe nobody will even want to see a televised Bafta ceremony next year.	806
Eddie Izzard, comedy genius and heroic campaigner for the European cause, is bizarrely miscast in a deadpan-serious acting role for this weird, strained, second world war spy melodrama inspired by a stranger-than-fiction true story. The transgender star switches back here to what Izzard has playfully called “boy mode” for a boy’s-own-story in the style of John Buchan or Erskine Childers, or maybe one of Michael Palin’s Ripping Yarns, though with the jokes and comic self-awareness systematically removed. It’s a muddled, unrelaxed tale from Izzard as co-writer and co-producer, whose dramatic gears keep slipping, and which is never entirely sure where our sympathies should lie. Izzard plays Thomas Miller, a teacher of Anglo-German ancestry who in the fraught summer of 1939 takes a job at the Augusta Victoria college in Bexhill-on-Sea, a kind of genteel finishing school for expatriate German adolescent girls; he is interviewed for the job by the naively pro-German English headmistress Miss Rocholl (with Judi Dench sleepwalking through the role). This extraordinary school really did exist throughout the 1930s, with a swastika discreetly sewn into its crest next to the union jack, and it was attended by the daughters and god-daughters of some very senior Nazis. Izzard imagines what might happen if, as war loomed, this place was the centre of a Nazi intelligence plot. A lively idea for a drama, but the sheer oddity of the real-life premise slows it down, and the film is unsure about whether we should see these teen blonde Mädchen pupils as Midwich-Cuckoo mini-Nazis or as poignant dupes. A spy story depends on secrecy and concealment, but this school is entirely open about its pro-German and pro-Nazi leanings from the outset. As for the character of Miller, he is supposed to be a real action hero, and there are loads of shots of Izzard running athletically and surreally away from the camera across open fields. The film itself runs out of breath. • Six Minutes to Midnight is released on 26 March on Sky Cinema.	375
The open secret of Victorian sexuality is rediscovered by film-maker Francis Lee in this fine, intimate, intelligently acted movie about forbidden love in 1840s Lyme Regis. But it isn’t exactly a tale of two French Lieutenant’s Women, despite the inevitably tense walk up the fabled Cobb, filmed in thoughtful longshot. The complicated power balance between the principals makes the comparison incorrect. Actually, the film that swam into my head afterwards was Jane Campion’s The Piano. Ammonite is an absorbing drama that sensationally brings together two superlative performers: Saoirse Ronan and Kate Winslet. Combining these alpha players doubles or actually quadruples the screen voltage, and their passion co-exists with the cool, calm subtlety with which Lee inspects the domestic circumstances in which their paths crossed. It is a film about a real-life relationship speculatively reimagined with some artistic licence. But I have to say that – paradoxically – the figures of this bodiced and bonneted movie, despite being based on real life, seemed a tiny bit less real than the fictional figures of his previous film, God’s Own Country. Yet they’re just as passionate. The heroine is Mary Anning, a pioneering 19th-century palaeontologist whose ideas and extraordinary fossil finds in Lyme Regis were coolly appropriated by the male scientific establishment from whose societies and clubs she was excluded, and probably had to put up with mediocre, mutton-chopped ninnies treating her as an eccentric amateur. The real Anning took comfort in her close friendship with fellow geologist Charlotte Murchison, whose own expertise seems to have equalled and predated her husband’s. Lee presents things differently. Winslet plays Anning as a tough, capable but careworn woman, one grown accustomed to not declaring her feelings. Winslet gives her a look of perpetual wary resentment but fierce intellectual assertion. She is a scientist forced to be a shopkeeper, running a tourist trap in Lyme Regis (“Anning’s Fossils &amp; Curios”), selling seashell-encrusted hand mirrors and the like. This subsidises her serious scientific work, scouring the shore for fossils, a beachcomber for ancient evolutionary secrets. Mary lives with her placid mother: a ripe performance from Gemma Jones. A smoothly condescending London scientist swans in, professing to admire Anning’s work. This is Roderick Murchison (James McArdle) who has in tow his catatonically depressed wife Charlotte (Ronan). He asks if, in return for a substantial cash payment, he might leave his wife behind to lodge with Anning for a while, so that the sea air and healthy scientific thoughts will cure her “melancholia”. But Charlotte’s melancholia is more to do with Roderick’s passionless dullness, and the more she stays with Mary, the more a new situation is revealed. Lee shows us the windswept seaspray in which Mary spends her days, crunching along the shore, grimly inspecting stones like an old prospector. Ronan’s Charlotte is glacial and pale as she gingerly picks her way along the beach behind her. Charlotte’s husband had been plaintively wondering where his clever wife disappeared to, and as her relationship with Mary progresses, and her mood thaws, Ronan shows us exactly where that pretty cleverness has got to – it was there all along. And it is precisely Charlotte’s effervescent, coquettish daring that allows her to take the initiative in their affair. We can see Mary and Charlotte grow 10 years younger before our eyes – and when Mary laughs, Winslet looks the way she did in Titanic. Winslet and Ronan don’t need CGI to do this. The question arises about Mary’s identity in the wider world: she seems to have had some sort of abandoned friendship with a local woman, Elizabeth (an elegant, sensitive performance from Fiona Shaw). But there is no homophobic disapproval in the 21st-century sense, and Lee dispenses with the old urban myth about Victoria and Victorian society not recognising the existence of gay women. At one stage, Charlotte kisses Mary in front of the housemaid, and, in answer to Mary’s panicky look, Charlotte just shrugs that this is just a “servant”, who in turn grimaces at her snobbery. Class is paramount in the recognition or non-recognition of sexuality. It is tempting to look for the metaphorical properties of fossil-hunting: the cracking open of stones, the discovery of secrets, the thrillingly real evidence of life. Of course, Charlotte and Mary’s love is not a fossil; it lives ecstatically in the flesh-and-blood present. But for Mary that’s what the ammonites and ichthyosaurs do as well. It is a love story that is also a fascinating artefact: quixotic, romantic, erotic.	885
My husband, Arif Hussein, who has died aged 63 from Covid-19, was an actor, theatre founder, screenwriter, film producer, winner of many international film festival awards and a Hollywood executive producer. Arif was born in Singapore to Rahim Bakash Qureshi, a waterman, and Maher Bibi (nee Jalaludin), a homemaker, both originally from Lahore in Pakistan. Arif’s father moved to the UK in 1960 in search of a new life while his family waited in Lahore. Unfortunately political events took over, and during the war between India and Pakistan in 1965, young Arif, along with his mother and his siblings, was placed in a refugee camp in Lahore. Contact with Arif’s father was lost because valuable letters with Arif’s father’s address were left in the inaccessible family home. His mother was illiterate, but Arif managed to remember fragments – “Villington Road, Bilstoon” which was how the address was pronounced but not written. Amazingly, a letter eventually reached Arif’s father in Wellington Road, Bilston, near Wolverhampton. Rahim had lost all hope that his wife and children were still alive. The family were reunited in 1969 in the UK when Arif was 11 years old. These early experiences of being displaced, homeless and fatherless for nine years never left Arif, and became a crucial part of his work in later life. In the UK, Arif took the name Hussein as his surname. After attending Graiseley secondary school and Wolfrun College, in Wolverhampton, he went to Mountview theatre school in Crouch End, north London to study acting from 1980 to 1983. He later went on to form Alma Mater Theatre Company, with Peter Ustinov and Derek Jacobi as patrons, and for six years he acted in, wrote and directed stage plays at his fringe theatre venue, the Taurus Theatre in Tufnell Park Tavern, London. We met in 1992 at London Weekend Television when Arif was cast in a drama reconstruction that I was directing for Michael Winner’s True Crimes. We married in London in 1996. In 2001 Arif took a master’s in screenwriting at the Northern Film School, with a bursary from Film4. In the same year he set up Kaos Films and created the British Short Screenplay Competition, described as “the most prestigious screenplay competition in the world” by Sir Kenneth Branagh. The winning screenplays were made into films, and several produced by Arif won prizes at international film festivals, including The Handyman (2006), starring Greta Scacchi, which won best film at Sitges, Dubrovnic, San Francisco Lights, Austin, and Rhode Island. The Stars Don’t Twinkle In Outer Space (2008) won best film at Rhode Island and Palm Springs; The Happiness Salesman (2010), starring Christopher Eccleston and Archie Panjabi, won best narrative at Rhode Island. From 2008 to 2011 Arif was visiting screenwriting lecturer at Middlesex University and the University of Bedfordshire. He was particularly affected by news stories about refugees, especially those drowned at sea. In the past few years he had tracked down 10 survivors scattered across the world, met them and heard their stories. It resulted in him being signed up as executive producer with Steven Spielberg and JJ Abrams on a joint feature film due to be produced by Paramount. Arif is survived by me, our children, Omar and Soraya, his brother Fida, and sisters, Shaida and Zahida.	651
Javier Cámara is the Spanish actor with the gentle, open, everyman face who has been a stalwart repertory player for Pedro Almodóvar for around 20 years, particularly in the mysterious and beautiful 2002 film Talk to Her; Cámara unforgettably played Benigno, the nurse tending to a young woman in a coma, believing that he must always talk to her. Now he gives a wonderful richness and warmth to this very affecting movie, directed by Fernando Trueba; it is based on the true story of Héctor Abad Gómez, the Colombian public-health activist and prominent government critic who in 1987 was shot dead in Medellín by far-right paramilitaries. It is adapted from the 2005 memoir of Gómez by his son, the now prominent Colombian author Héctor Abad Faciolince, entitled El Olvido Que Seremos (which is the movie’s original Spanish title), meaning Forgotten We’ll Be. (It is taken from the Borges poem, The Epitaph: “Already we are the oblivion we shall be.”) Cámara plays Gómez, the professor, husband and father to a lively and talented family of mostly girls, and one somewhat pampered son: Hector, played by Nicolás Reyes Cano as a moon-faced boy and then by Juan Pablo Urrego as an earnest, bespectacled literature student. Gómez is adored by his family, by his students and by the local community in Medellín, in whose streets he is an inspiring figure, striding around proselytising for what he calls the five basic human rights: air, water, food, shelter and affection. But he is continuously harassed by the authorities for these progressive views, and forced to take an evasive sabbatical abroad at one stage and finally early retirement. The movie has “present-tense” scenes in the 1980s, shot in black and white, but Hector’s ecstatically remembered 1970s childhood is shot in sunlit colour. This is a wonderfully sympathetic, deeply felt and tenderly funny family drama with a novelistic attention to details and episodes – a little like Alfonso Cuáron’s Roma, about growing up in a similar era in Mexico City. Cámara thoroughly inhabits the figure of Gómez: unselfconsciously inspiring and lovable. • Memories of My Father is released on 26 March on Curzon Home Cinema.	417
The big, unique selling point of this somewhat sappy but quite watchable feature is that the two main roles – a charismatic, widowed artist named Robert and his handsome but still finding-his-feet-careerwise son Jack – are played by Liam Neeson and his real-life son, up-and-coming actor Micheál Richardson. In the film, Robert’s wife/Jack’s mother died tragically young in a car accident. This, of course, parallels the death of Neeson’s real-life wife/Richardson’s mother, Natasha, from injuries incurred during a skiing accident when her sons were still in their teens. Knowing all this adds a certain frisson to the climactic scene where father and son have it out about the different ways they handled the late woman’s death. But the lack of finesse, in scriptwriting terms, with which the emotional punch is landed robs the scene of the impact it deserves. Elsewhere, the yarn is more entertaining as an uber-bougie slice of property porn about the two men bonding as they fix up, with ludicrously obvious symbolism, the palatial Tuscan house they inherited from Jack’s late mother. Jack, it transpires, wants to sell the place so he can buy an art gallery he ran for his own ex-wife’s family. Obviously, he’s going to be tempted away from that path by the golden sunlight of the region and the charms of pretty local woman Natalia (Valeria Bilello); the kind of restaurant owner who, unlike any real-life restaurateur, doesn’t seem to need to spend much time at her establishment, leaving her lots of free hours to float about in tea dresses and hang out with the visiting menfolk from London painting walls. Realism is clearly not a strong suit for writer-director James D’Arcy, but he gets pretty good comic performances from his likeable cast, which includes Lindsay Duncan as an acerbic estate agent. •Made in Italy is released on 26 March on Amazon Prime Video.	365
Orlando Bloom has often looked perfectly happy with a Hollywood career, starring in movies as opposed to necessarily acting in them. But he outdoes himself in this British indie drama playing a man traumatised by childhood sexual abuse at the hands of a Catholic priest. There’s a kind of blunt brute force to his performance – and he looks almost unrecognisable, as if he’s using certain muscles in his face for the first time. The film is a horror story: a disturbing, hard-to-watch ordeal with a lacerating script by Geoff Thompson, a sexual-abuse survivor who has written courageously about his own experience. Bloom is Malcolm, known to everyone as Malky, a nickname that doesn’t remotely suit him. He swaggers about full of rage, flying into a temper if anyone so much as looks at him funny. Malcolm works in the macho world of demolition, stripping old churches of fixtures and fittings before the bulldozers move in. Just in case you miss the point, his mum says over tea: “There’s a lot of churches. You won’t be able to knock them all down.” There’s a good deal of this sort of heavy symbolism, giving the whole thing an overcooked, oppressive feel. Malcolm’s shame and fear of intimacy emerge in some unflinchingly grim scenes. Sex with his on-off barmaid girlfriend (Janet Montgomery) is cold and horrible. At home, in secret, Malcolm abuses himself, staring into the mirror while he rapes himself with a wooden truncheon – it’s a shocking moment, and it will be too much for some. One day, having a pint in his local, Malcolm spots the paedophile priest (James Smillie) who raped him – he’s been moved back to the parish. The confrontation and narrative resolution that follow feel a bit hastily sketched-out. But there are lines here that land like a punch: “I was 12. When I woke up the next day I was 100.” • Retaliation is released on 26 March on digital platforms.	389
Hollywood stylists are bemoaning the loss of the virtual red carpet, with the news that the Oscars will be a small live event with no Zoom element to it. A letter from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences released to the film industry website Deadline said: “Our plan is to stage an intimate, in-person event at Union station in Los Angeles, with additional show elements live from the Dolby theatre in Hollywood.” “You’re wondering about the dress code (as well you should),” added the letter, signed by the ceremony’s producers, including the director Steven Soderbergh. “We’re aiming for a fusion of inspirational and aspirational, which in actual words means formal is totally cool if you want to go there, but casual is really not.” Virtual red carpets, which have taken place mainly via Instagram, have been liberating for stylists. “It has given us a lot of control as stylists as we’ve been able to manipulate lighting, angles and backgrounds to our liking,” said Wayman Bannerman from the duo Wayman + Micah who dressed Regina King for the Emmys and Critics’ Choice awards. “I have really enjoyed the way some celebs and their stylists have turned that platform into full-fledged fashion shoots,” said Heather Cocks, a fashion commentator. “There is a definite fashion bright side to a virtual carpet in that truly anything goes from barefoot in pyjamas to full-on couture,” agreed Elizabeth Stewart, who dressed Viola Davis and Amanda Seyfried for the Golden Globes. “Virtual dressing has pushed us to think more outside the box and have more fun, whether it be through colours or silhouettes,” added Bannerman. Since the pandemic began, the entertainment industry has been struggling with dress codes for virtual award ceremonies. At the Grammys, many embraced full red-carpet looks again with the exception of John Legend, who celebrated his best R&amp;B album win while wearing a Versace bathrobe. “I’m not sure why the Oscars decided to treat everyone like children,” said Cocks. “Also, come on: You’re really not going to let in Viola Davis or Carey Mulligan if they show up in jeans? Sure, Jan. Honestly, all it’s done is make me wish that all the invitees would show up en masse in flannel nightgowns and Ugg slippers, just to thumb their noses at it.” Stewart is looking on the bright side. “Not only should the dress code honour the occasion of this very prestigious award show, but the red carpet can also be a show of support for the fashion industry, which has really suffered during the past year.” The ceremony, which will have a Covid safety team with PCR testing capability to hand, will take place on 26 April.	534
A new image of Kristen Stewart as Princess Diana has been released, as shooting on forthcoming biopic Spencer moves to the UK. Stewart, 30, will play the late princess in the film, directed by Chilean film-maker Pablo Larraín, whose biopic of Jackie Kennedy starring Natalie Portman won multiple Oscar nominations in 2017. In the photograph, Stewart smiles directly at the camera, wearing a layered blond bob as well as tartan blazer and diamond engagement ring that appear to be copies of those sported by the real woman. The film’s autumn release follows rave reviews for the most recent season of Netflix’s The Crown, in which Emma Corrin played the princess, winning a Golden Globe for her performance, as did Josh O’Connor as Prince Charles. The actor playing Prince Charles in the new film will be Jack Farthing, best known as baddie George Warleggan in BBC’s Poldark. Farthing, 35, also played John Lennon in ITV’s Cilla Black series and featured in The Riot Club, the big-screen version of the play Posh. The film is scripted by Peaky Blinders’ Steven Knight, and scored by Radiohead’s Jonny Greenwood. Supporting cast include Timothy Spall, Sally Hawkins and Sean Harris. The actors playing the young princes William and Harry have not been announced; last year, British passport holders were ruled out of contention for the roles over post-Brexit visa concerns. Spencer is set over the course of a decisive weekend in December 1991, during which Princess Diana spends the Christmas holidays with the royal family at Sandringham, and decides to leave her marriage to Prince Charles. “The Prince and Princess of Wales’ marriage has long since grown cold,” reads a press release. “Though rumours of affairs and a divorce abound, peace is ordained for the Christmas festivities at Sandringham Estate. There’s eating and drinking, shooting and hunting. Diana knows the game. This year, things will be a whole lot different.” It’s the first big feature film to be made about the princess since 2013’s much-ridiculed Diana, which starred Naomi Watts and was labelled “car crash cinema” by the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw. Stewart described Spencer in a statement as “a dive inside an emotional imagining of who Diana was at a pivotal turning point in her life”. Filming was taking place in Germany, but has moved to the UK. The film is scheduled for release this autumn.	465
A scheme set up by Bafta with the aim of improving diversity in the film and TV industry has come under fire from one of its former participants, who said she had experienced racist comments and a lack of promised disability support. India Eva Rae, who joined Bafta’s Elevate programme in 2019, told the BBC that a casting director told her she was an “exotic talent”, and that they “can’t understand the English coming out your mouth”. Rae also said that she had been told not to report the incident by a “mentor” on the scheme: “This mentor told me and other members of the group that we will never work again if we speak up.” Bafta CEO Amanda Berry said in response that the organisation “was aware that [Rae] had had a negative experience with a casting director, as they mentioned it in passing … but we are not aware that this happened as part of the Elevate programme.” The BBC also report that Bafta said it had not received any complaints about either incident, but that if it had, they would have been taken extremely seriously. Rae also said she had difficulties accessing disability support. Rae was selected in 2019 for Bafta’s Elevate programme after featuring in the Channel 4 anthology series On the Edge. Elevate was set up in 2017 and is described by Bafta as “a new bespoke annual programme that aims to elevate individuals from under-represented groups to the next stage of their career”. It was one of a set of initiatives introduced by Bafta to increase diversity in the film and TV industry, alongside changes to eligibility for its awards and membership process. Bafta recently joined the the BFI to relaunch a programme to combat bullying, harassment and racism in the screen industries. Berry added: “It is a matter of great sadness and regret for me that anyone would feel this way, and our door remains completely open to find a solution, and to ensure that every participant benefits from the scheme.” “I know that other participants have found this to be a truly fantastic opportunity.” In a statement to Deadline, Bafta said: “Bafta condemns bullying, harassment, racism and discrimination of any kind and we take allegations of this nature incredibly seriously and will investigate urgently. We go to great lengths to ensure our programmes are as inclusive and accessible as possible for everyone who takes part, whatever their specific support needs are, and have responded to and want to resolve the participant’s requests in this area.”	480
Whoever wins, parents lose. While there’s little to truly loathe in Fantastic Four and Ride Along director Tim Story’s frantic new take on Tom &amp; Jerry, there’s also an equal lack of anything to truly love; this is a serviceable, if entirely forgettable attempt to relaunch an old property for a new audience. Very young kids might find some enjoyment in the brightly hued, fast-paced mania of it all, but those with any real affection for the pair of violently opposed animals will leave unimpressed. With a script that feels lazily retrofitted to revolve around the two animals rather than designed directly for them, this is basically a kids’ movie about antics in a New York hotel that pauses every so often to feature a sanitised fight between the pair. The decision to combine live action with animation often jars (every human is real, every animal is animated) and, within the realism of Manhattan, we’re then left with questions about the rules that have been haphazardly set up. (Why, for example, can some animals talk but not others? Violence seems to cause no harm to animals, so would humans also be immune?). These are questions that we perhaps wouldn’t be forced to ask if the film itself were more engaging. Chloë Grace Moretz, playing a grifter turned hotel employee turned cat and mouse peacemaker, is at least well-suited to the material. Her precocious brand of acting has seemed to pause rather than progress as she segues from child to adulthood, but her over-pronounced comedy works well here – there’s a brisk efficiency to her scenes with suspicious co-workers played by Rob Delaney and Michael Peña (both far more comfortable than SNL’s Colin Jost, fully lost). The animals themselves are a little underpowered, their signature scraps never quite inventive or audacious enough. The film’s sunny energy and its refreshing lack of toilet humour (something that’s stunk up many a kids’ movie in recent years) makes it an inoffensive effort, but it’ll race from your memory faster than Jerry from Tom. • Tom &amp; Jerry The Movie is released on 25 March on digital platforms.	420
A Week Away, Netflix’s High School Musical-style play for the contemporary Christian teen market, feels strangely unrooted from our timeline. The musical about a week at a Christian summer camp, directed by Roman White, is ostensibly set in the present yet transparently derives its musical and choreography cues from mid-2000s Disney projects like the aforementioned series and Camp Rock, and lead Kevin Quinn looks eerily like Zac Efron circa 2009. It’s a coming-of-age (and faith) movie in which there are barely any phones to be found. The film opens with a premise too pat and aloof to suspend one’s disbelief: wayward orphan Will Hawkins (Quinn) has stolen a cop car, among a slew of petty crimes, and the consequence? After polite arrest for running from an officer with guitar case in hand, a polite admonishment from Children and Family Services about the threat of juvie (yes, this teen is white; no, this film does not seem at all cognizant of how this plays after last summer’s protests against anti-black police brutality, or of race at all). Luckily for Will, he’s swiftly fostered by a black mother, Kristin (Sherri Shepherd), and her son George (Jahbril Cook) on the condition that he spend a week at the Christian summer camp where Kristin works. I have no idea how such conditional fostering would work legally, but that’s beside the point in this ludicrous, grating ploy for tacitly conservative audiences. The teen fare of the Disney Channel on which it’s modeled has often required a laughable suspension of reality belief, but A Week Away, arriving a decade-plus after the High School Musical heyday, feels all the more obtuse for it. The film, written by producer Adam Powell and Gabe Vasquez, is like Camp Rock in eager, evangelical overdrive: immediately after Will agrees to attend a week of camp rather than state institutionalization, Kristin breaks into song about God’s grace and the group “follows our leader” to Camp Aweegaway (pronounced like a slurred “a week away”). The ebullient singing and dancing continues from there through the usual straightforward teen movie beats: Will falls on sight for Avery (Bailee Madison), the daughter of the camp’s queasily confident director (David Koechner); afraid of turning off Avery’s perfect-girl image, Will lies about his identity, thus setting the plot’s ticking time bomb. There’s a halfheartedly applied obstacle in the form of smug camp regular Sean (Iain Tucker) who suspects Will’s natural charm as duplicitous (the film has enough self-awareness to at least mock self-righteous mission trips). Camp hijinks, water sports and Will’s conversion to faith ensue. The low stakes of the camp drama and the soundtrack’s indistinguishably familiar pop (adaptations of contemporary Christian hits, plus four original songs) aim for easy, catchy, comfortable fun – a breezy intention which casts some of the script’s insensitive moments in even harsher light. Take, for example, a cringey scene in which Koechner, wearing a headdress, presides over the mostly white camp’s Native American-style ceremony to select teams for the week’s “Warrior Games” through the dramatic application of war paint. Or a scene during said Warrior Games that roves through a paintball match. It’s meant to establish Avery’s beguiling competitiveness and her connection with Will, but plays like a strange ode to war; the sweet couple’s triumphant moment is a slo-mo shot of them emerging from a shed, Mr-and-Mrs-Smith-style, two guns a-blazing each. That these assumptions on what’s unremarkable are made by a movie appealing to America’s largely white, culturally conservative evangelical audience is not surprising. Also not surprising is how closely Netflix’s foray into the faith-based market aligns with the Disney Channel, which was always faith-adjacent if not outright evangelical (Disney talent of the Camp Rock era, including stars Demi Lovato and the Jonas brothers, publicly wore purity rings signaling their intention to remain virgins until marriage). There’s significant Disney overlap with the production: Quinn starred on the Disney Channel series Bunk’d, Cook will lead the upcoming Disney movie Spin, and musical director Adam Watts has written and produced music for High School Musical, Camp Rock and Hannah Montana. Netflix will always play for wider audiences by mining every niche, including America’s relatively siloed Christian content subculture. Films centered on faith can be empathetic, open-hearted, inviting, and I say that as an admittedly skeptical secular viewer. But A Week Away is too shallow for that, and its suburban conservative pandering appears even worse compared to Netflix’s recent slate of nuanced, genre-challenging teen films such as Moxie and The Half of It. It’s by the fading, overdone numbers, chasing magic best confined to the late 2000s. A Week Away is available on Netflix now	941
Pope Francis was recently bathed in movie love, courtesy of Fernando Meirelles’s The Two Popes, with its excellent performances from Jonathan Pryce as Pope Francis, and Anthony Hopkins as the now emeritus Pope Benedict XVI; this film sentimentally imagined a pontiff bromance between the outgoing conservative and incoming liberal. The truth might be more complicated. Before that, there was Wim Wenders’s deeply respectful documentary Pope Francis: A Man of His Word, which paid tribute to Francis’s new engagement with issues such as the climate crisis, refugees and inequality. Now there is another docu-celebration, from the Oscar-nominated director Evgeny Afineevsky (Winter on Fire), who perhaps has had direct interview access with his subject, though it isn’t clear; there is some bland material of Francis talking to someone off-camera. As ever, the pope’s forthright and unselfconscious discussion of global issues such as poverty is impressive – he is the only world leader doing so – but, like the Wenders film, this is another baffling act of complete submission, a glossy promo video for His Holiness, with innumerable drone shots of cities worldwide, loads of Hello!-mag-style interviews with supportive friends and colleagues (but no critics), and regular screenshots of His Holiness’s tweets, including one on pollution in 2015: “The earth, our home, is beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of filth.” A somewhat unfortunately phrased or translated remark, which you can imagine some of his predecessors making in many different contexts. The big difference between this documentary and Wenders’s is that this addresses the pope’s huge change of heart on child abuse, especially the case of Juan Carlos Cruz, who wrote a letter to the pope detailing his abuse at the hands of Father Fernando Karadima in Santiago, Chile; Francis initially dismissed this as “slander”, but then did a complete turnaround, defrocking Karadima and apologising to Cruz. Here is the one real issue where something is personally at stake for the pope: perhaps the whole film should have been about this. But just like Wenders, Afineevsky has nothing on the pope’s most extraordinary pronouncement, on the Charlie Hebdo murders in 2015: “If my good friend Alberto Gasparri [his travel adviser] says a curse word against my mother, he can expect a punch. It’s normal. You cannot provoke. You cannot insult the faith of others.” A punch? Twelve people were murdered in reprisal for satire, an outrage followed by and connected to a kosher supermarket siege two days later in which four Jewish people were killed. This is another well-intentioned but syrupy and pointless hagiography. • Francesco is released on 28 March on Discovery+.	520
When Jan de Bont’s Speed 2: Cruise Control was released in 1997, there were only two American critics who gave it positive reviews: Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert. The film’s reputation has not improved since then and, in 2010, Empire magazine included it on its list of 50 worst movies ever, alongside the likes of Ed Wood’s Plan 9 From Outer Space and Tommy Wiseau’s The Room. Siskel and Ebert aside, it seems, everyone hates Speed 2. But Siskel and Ebert were right. A rare big-budget action movie that gives a woman top billing, Speed 2 is a perfectly serviceable sequel. Its execrable reputation comes largely from people who take the original Speed too seriously protesting that Speed 2 doesn’t take itself seriously enough. So poorly was the film received that sitcom writers Graham Linehan and Arthur Matthews, neither of whom had seen Speed 2, challenged themselves to write the Speed 3 episode of Father Ted in an attempt to think up a story “which could be worse than Speed 2”. It features a milk float fitted with a bomb set to detonate if the float goes below four miles per hour. Similarly, an episode of Family Guy features a fictional sequel to Speed 2 titled “Speed 3: Glacier Of Doom”, in which a glacier will explode if it moves slower than one mile per year. These parodies appear to result from – or perhaps have resulted in – widespread misperceptions about the plot of Speed 2. People who haven’t seen the film in years (or haven’t seen it at all) often believe that, while Speed involves a bomb on a bus that will explode if the bus goes below 50 miles an hour, its sequel involves a bomb on a boat that will explode if the boat dips below a ludicrously slow speed. But that simply isn’t the story Speed 2 tells. Instead, it concerns a vengeful ex-employee of a cruise line who overrides the autopilot on a cruise ship and programs it to collide with either an oil tanker or a densely populated island pier. There is no speed-sensitive bomb aboard, and the plot is no more absurd than those of innumerable escapist action movies that receive nothing like the scorn heaped upon Speed 2. One of the most frequent charges brought against the film is that Sandra Bullock’s character, Annie, deserves better than to be relegated to the role of passive hostage while her boyfriend, played by Jason Patric, gets to be the hero. But it isn’t quite right to say that she is. The reason the script has Annie taken hostage by John Geiger (Willem Dafoe) is so that she, the film’s heroine, can have a one-on-one confrontation with its villain – and outwit him. After Geiger abducts her, Annie works out a way to leave him stranded behind her while she zooms off on a jet ski and he wails the intentionally comic line: “Annie! Come back! … You’re my hostage!” What’s more, at the moment she is taken hostage, Annie cleverly pushes a button that winches her boyfriend and the ship’s first officer up from under the water, thus saving their lives and allowing them to save the lives of every passenger still on the ocean liner. Among those passengers, the most memorable is Drew, a 14-year-old girl played by the deaf actor Christine Firkins. (Having earned a doctorate, Firkins is no longer acting but has become an assistant professor in the department of deaf studies at California State University.) Disabled people, including me, are still campaigning for disabled actors to be cast as disabled characters now – a quarter of a century after Speed 2 was made – so the movie was admirably progressive for its time. This is something able-bodied critics seldom seem to notice when they trash it. The film showcases American Sign Language, and shows Drew enjoying music by dancing and hand signing along to a favourite song. Drew’s dancing illuminates something people who can hear often don’t understand: the deep relationship deaf people can have with music. In her few scenes, Firkins gives a more authentic and insightful portrayal of the life of a disabled person than any of the slew of Oscar-winning performances by able-bodied actors playing disabled characters. No film that allows an actress to do that can be truly bad. And it certainly can’t be one of the worst movies ever made. Speed 2: Cruise Control is available to rent in the US and on Now TV in the UK	868
The revenge movie is the blunt weapon in the film-maker’s toolkit. Audience bloodlust is sated by justifiable violence; we get a guilt-free kick out of the kicking because justice is seen to be served. As a genre, it’s effective, but basic. Infinitely more unsettling and challenging are the films that dissect the whole idea of revenge, confronting the audience with its own complicity – films such as Gaspar Noé’s Irréversible and now Madeleine Sims-Fewer and Dusty Mancinelli’s brutal and brilliant directorial debut, Violation. Violation is as much a film about trauma as it is about revenge. In a PTSD-shattered timeline, the remarkable Sims-Fewer plays Miriam, a woman visiting her sister (Anna Maguire) and brother-in-law (Jesse LaVercombe). The sisters cling to a comfort blanket of shared history, but it’s soon stained by an act of betrayal. Miriam finds herself compelled to seek revenge. But no amount of meticulous planning can prepare her – and us – for the visceral realities of the act. The muted natural light of dawn and dusk elsewhere in the film is a contrast to the scorching campfire orange that drenches the violence; the naturalism of the performances is heightened by merciless details in the sound design. It’s gruelling, but fiercely intelligent film-making. Available exclusively on Shudder	247
A child’s-eye view of a hero father – Javier Cámara stars as dedicated parent, doctor, human-rights leader and all-round good egg Héctor Abad Gómez – is saturated with a honeyed colour palette and an unapologetically sentimental score. But as the child grows into an adult, the film adopts starker black-and-white photography and a harder-edged approach to Colombia’s tumultuous political backdro. Adapted, somewhat inelegantly, from an autobiographical novel by Héctor Abad Faciolince, Memories of My Father is a touch overlong and soapy and awkwardly structured. But it’s still an engrossingly watchable drama. • On Curzon Home Cinema	112
The long-running feud between cat and smart-aleck mouse gets a new platform in this feature-length adaptation of the Hanna Barbera cartoon. The backdrop is a swanky Manhattan hotel, which is set to host the wedding of the year. The approach, a marriage of cluttered live action with madcap 2D animation, owes an obvious debt to Who Framed Roger Rabbit, but has more in common with the wearisome and unfunny Garfield: The Movie. Chloë Grace Moretz stars as Kayla, an opportunist who cons her way into a job using a stolen résumé. It’s astute casting – Moretz’s habitually overblown acting style seems slightly less jarring when juxtaposed with rampaging cartoon elephants. The film is most entertaining when it wreaks havoc – a car chase involving a commandeered military drone is a slickly executed riot. But lazy writing squashes any real fun as emphatically as an Acme anvil dropped from a roof. • Available on all platforms	172
This handsome second feature from the writer-director of 2017’s brilliant God’s Own Country is another hesitant love story set against the backdrop of a bracing British locale: the sea-battered Dorset coast around the famous Cobb of Lyme Regis harbour. It has been the setting for some overcooked screen moments in the past, although the emotional weather forecast here is frosty with occasional storms. Kate Winslet is superbly flinty as Mary Anning, the 19th-century palaeontologist whose under-attributed finds have graced the display cases of the British Museum since her childhood. An early image sees a handwritten label for the historic “Sea Lizard, found by Miss Mary Anning” being tuttingly replaced by a floridly embellished sign reading “Ichthyosaurus, Lyme Regis, Presented by H Hoste Henley Esq”. It’s a concise way of illustrating both Anning’s outsider status (her role in the discovery is effectively usurped) and the snobbery of an establishment averse to inclusivity. Anning runs a shop selling “Fossils and Curios”, which she gathers from the rugged coastline, striding purposefully over rocks and foam. Like Daniel Plainview in the opening movement of There Will Be Blood, Winslet’s heroine is a figure of few words and imposing stature, driven by an internal engine that seems to require no human contact. Her mother, Molly (the redoubtable Gemma Jones), is equally insular; theirs is not a household filled with warmth and laughter. Watching this, I longed for a shawl to wrap snuggly around my shoulders. Things change when Mary meets Charlotte Murchison (Saoirse Ronan, excellent), a young woman in the throes of a debilitating depression whose husband wants her to stay with Anning, albeit temporarily. Perhaps the invigorating air and the chance to observe Anning at work will restore the once-vibrant spirit that has withered in his company. Mary is not keen, but payment is promised and arrangements made. Soon, Charlotte’s fine clothes are becoming muddied and torn on the rocks. Gradually, the pair’s growing friendship gives way to passion – strangely desperate couplings amid the stark silences of the house. The real-life Murchison was an accomplished geologist and illustrator who became close to Anning, although Lee’s decision to portray them as lovers has inevitably ruffled some feathers. In response, Lee has stated: “After seeing queer history be routinely ‘straightened’ throughout culture, and given a historical figure where there is no evidence whatsoever of a heterosexual relationship, is it not permissible to view that person within another context?” It’s a powerful point, eloquently made, although, in the end, issues of class and gender, rather than sexual orientation, seem more central to Lee’s film. It’s no accident that Ammonite opens with a woman industriously polishing a floor, only to recoil in head-bowed subservience as “gentlemen” march by. While Ralph Fiennes’s archaeologist Basil Brown was snubbed in The Dig for being largely self-taught, Winslet’s Anning faces the double whammy of being both an autodidact and a woman. Wisely, Lee lets these events speak for themselves, rather than hammering home any sociopolitical message through needless expository dialogue. Stéphane Fontaine’s crisp cinematography perfectly captures the bleak chilliness of the environment, while Dustin O’Halloran and Volker Bertelmann’s sparingly used score is as notable for the gaping voids in which it doesn’t appear as for those carefully chosen moments when it does. It adds up to an expertly crafted film that nonetheless feels somewhat distanced and removed, like an exhibit under glass. At times, I was reminded of the austere atmosphere of Michael Winterbottom’s Jude, another critical triumph for Winslet. Both films have much to admire artistically; both left me just a little cold. • Ammonite is available on various streaming platforms	719
Christian Petzold’s Undine is an intriguing, bemusing oddity of a film: a suspense drama-thriller with a fey supernatural twist. It’s a sphinx that, if not exactly without a secret, has less of a secret than it thinks it has. And it is possible to come away from the film less than convinced, but very impressed by the sheer force of Petzold’s film-making talent (recently so stunning in his drama Transit) but which has been here deployed for something which is a bit flimsy and silly. Paula Beer plays Undine who, as her name suggests, may have intense sympathies with water. She lives in Berlin, and is a stylish and elegant historian who lectures on the city’s architectural history at the Berlin City Models exhibition. But she is also conducting an unhappy adulterous affair with Johannes (Jacob Matschenz), which is reaching its unhappy end at the film’s opening - revealing a flash of something angry and even violent in Undine. But in the midst of this traumatic episode, Undine is to have a fateful encounter with a strange man who has heard her lecture, and appears to be in love with her. This is Christoph, an underwater diver played by Franz Rogowski - a sensual screen presence with a little of Joaquin Phoenix. Soon Undine and Christoph are having a passionate affair, and he introduces her to his mysterious professional world, little guessing that she may be far more at home in it than he ever could be. Their relationship is passionately sensual, though Undine is perplexed at the sheer rapture with which Christoph listens to her lectures about Berlin’s planning history. Is there a metaphorical dimension to this? Maybe. Certainly their emotional connection has restored something like happiness to her, and effaced the mad furious unhappiness of her former liaison. But then she is to chance across Johannes once again and a terrible destiny begins to stir in those watery depths with which Undine feels such empathy. In truth, Undine is a bit of a shaggy dog story, or maybe a slimy giant catfish story; though it is just so skilfully made, beautifully acted and directed. Rogowski brings something unstable and dangerous to the part and so, in a more contained way, does Beer. What might this cast and this director do if they were working on a more compelling and substantial story? As it stands, Undine is a diverting and handsomely crafted piece of fantasy. • Released on 2 April on Curzon Home Cinema	472
Here’s an interesting project from the film school at Falmouth University: a low-budget drama put together by four film-makers – including director Justin John Doherty and screenwriter Neil Fox, a Falmouth lecturer – with professional actors but otherwise crewed entirely by student first-timers skipping the intern phase. The result is rather lovely, a talky cine-literate portrait of a new relationship set in the 1960s. (I’m not sure you could make such an uncynical film about a couple falling in love in the present day.) It reminded me a little of Blue Valentine, without the messy raw bits, or the divorce – basically before Ryan Gosling gets a beer gut. There’s a nice emotional fluency to James Barnes’ performance as John, a thoughtful jazz musician who drives with his new girlfriend Alice (Katharine Davenport) to a cottage by the sea for the weekend. There is terrific chemistry between the pair; they can’t keep their hands off each other. But John has a gnawing fear that it won’t last, that love will fade. Alice is sunnier-natured, a bit careless of other people’s feelings. There are two crisis episodes over the weekend. John takes Alice for dinner at the house of old friends, another couple, who have left London. The husband Charlie (Sebastian Badarau) is a drummer who has given up touring to teach. Nothing much happens but it emerges that John hasn’t been honest about how well he knows the wife Francis (Bean Downes). Feeling betrayed, Alice ruthlessly flirts with both Charlie and Francis to punish him. Hungover the next day they get stranded on the beach as the tide comes in. Everything plays out in absorbing emotional detail. My only reservation with the film is how tasteful it is – from Alice’s chic boyish haircut to the Scandi-chrome coffee pot and the sweat-free sex. And it’s out of politeness perhaps that the film avoids the issue of race. John is black, and Alice is white, and there’s a nasty incident on the beach when a dog tramples their picnic. Its owner, a tweed-capped toff, is blatantly racist; it’s as clear as daylight. The couple talk about everything, but not this? • Wilderness is released on 5 April on digital platforms.	439
As ever-evolving technologies produce instant gratifications and fresh horrors, Selfie sees modern life as a tragicomic minefield fraught with absurdities. This French anthology film delivers biting social critique with a side helping of je ne sais quoi wit. Across five loosely connected stories from five seasoned film-makers (including Rust and Bone scriptwriter Thomas Bidegain), human idiosyncrasies are constricted by algorithms and reduced to likes. Though pushed to ridiculous comedic heights, Selfie’s cautionary tales are not so far-fetched. A married couple whose famous vlogs revolve around their son’s cancer scramble for content now that he is cured. In a reversal of stereotypes, a female teacher anonymously ambushes a viral male comedian with vicious tweets, only to pique his romantic interest. A seemingly content man slowly unravels as he blindly obeys his algorithmic ads. An awkward millennial manipulates his ratings on a dating app through nefarious methods. And finally, the farcical pièce de résistance: on an island with limited phone signals, a wedding goes haywire as a massive data hack reveals everyone’s dirtiest online secrets. All (digital) hell breaks loose. Underneath these satirical Black Mirror-esque scenarios are all-too-relatable emotional issues. The characters wrestle with online abuse, shopping addiction, stalking impulses and countless other urban malaises. Notifications overstuff their lives – and the film’s frame – yet leave them dissatisfied. No wonder they whisper online metrics as pillow talk. It’s a weakness that, for a film so heavily centred on social media, Selfie lacks tech savviness when it comes to certain platforms. For instance, in the “Vlog” section, it makes little sense that the couple’s videos fluctuate between two million views one moment and a measly 900 hits the next simply because of the cancer-free announcement. Nevertheless, Selfie’s cackleworthy dialogues and energetic performances more than make up for the occasional missteps. • Selfie is released on 26 March on Your Screen.	361
This soft-headed comedy-drama has the profundity and about the same wit level of one of those joke signs you see above bars, and often feels like it was scripted on a hangover after a two-day bender. Jeremy Piven plays Mick, prodigal real estate-developer son who returns to his old stomping ground of Darby Heights (based on Philadelphia’s Upper Darby) for his mother’s funeral. His feckless buddies, including jail-hopping brother Dougal (Zach McGowan), are still living their old boozy lives. What Mick thinks will revitalise the neighbourhood – and fend off the real-estate sharks circling, among other things, his dad’s pub – is a new casino. The obvious contradiction here – that Mick’s idea is ridiculous, and he is in fact part of what is threatening Darby Heights – is never meaningfully broached, as Last Call lets the hot topic of gentrification go begging. Director Paolo Pilladi and writer Greg Lingo (who is from Upper Darby) are so fired up making the film an ode to bar-room high jinks and blue-collar camaraderie that characterisation suffers. The boys call Mick out for forgetting his roots – but dragging him off for the umpteenth binge, they are mystifyingly unquestioning of his canvassing for the casino. Last Call visibly crunches gears when it does remember to tackle Mick’s divided loyalties, like when he (implausibly) asks one of his real-estate associates outside when he gets into a spat with a bar pal. The badinage is sporadically funny – even if it drifts too much towards the puerile, as with a running gag about Mick’s priapism problem. But any hope Last Call might skate by on working-class charm is hobbled by Pilladi’s timid direction: flat-footed and full of unimaginative choices. When Mick and his dad are having a heart-to-heart, Irish folk music lilts on the soundtrack; for the Greek family of Mick’s crush, Ali (Taryn Manning), it’s jaunty rebetiko. It all lets down an impressive cast that includes Bruce Dern, Raging Bull’s Cathy Moriarty and Scream’s Jamie Kennedy. One of the boys in Entourage, Piven breezes through likably enough – possibly they hoped that was a pass for the film’s flakiness. • Last Call is released on 29 March on digital plaforms.	432
They are cancelling everything! At least, if you’re a particular brand of conservative commentator they are. First they came for the Muppets and Dr Seuss, now they’re cancelling Pepé Le Pew! Yes, everyone’s favourite caricature-French cartoon skunk has reportedly been excised from the forthcoming Space Jam sequel. What’s the world coming to? Where will it end? An answer to the first question might be “its senses”. Secondly, there’s no homogenous “they” here. Those desperate to engage in a new culture war are constantly seeking to conjure some “woke” bogeyman to blame for what are actually different decisions made by different groups of people, of their own volition. As for where it ends, a better question might be, where did it start? Because what is currently being decried as “cancel culture” is absolutely nothing new. Children’s animation is a good place to start. Pepé is no longer invited to the party on account of his defining characteristic being “sexual predator who never takes ‘no’ for an answer”. But the rest of the Looney Tunes gang are still joining LeBron James for Space Jam: A New Legacy this May – even, at the time of writing, the problematic Mexican stereotype Speedy Gonzales. It is no secret that these characters have a chequered past. Cartoon history is filled with horrendously offensive depictions of non-white people: Native Americans, Latinos, east Asians, and especially those of African descent, from blackface minstrels to spear-waving cannibals. In 1944’s Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips, Bugs lands on a Pacific island populated by Japanese caricatures. In 1953, Bugs wore blackface and pretended to be a slave. In 1941, he outwitted a dim African-American hunter and won all his clothes off him. That episode is part of a notorious selection of Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies known as the “Censored Eleven”, which the studio pulled owing to their offensiveness – in 1968. It is a similar story with Tom and Jerry, currently to be found frolicking with Chloë Grace Moretz and Michael Peña in their feature-length comeback. They were also once partial to racist stereotyping. You won’t find “Mammy Two Shoes” – the caricature black housemaid – in their new movie. But then you won’t find her in the cartoons, either; she was replaced by a white character after complaints from the NAACP – in 1953. Cancel culture from 70 years ago? The point is less that past entertainment was sometimes racist; we have always known that. It’s that we have always been able to look back and say: ‘Maybe this isn’t a great thing to be broadcasting any more.’ Does anybody seriously have a problem with that? The terminology has been updated, but let’s not pretend there’s anything new or dangerous happening. It’s society moving forward. That’s all, folks.	564
I’m sure you must be wondering why a movie in which there is a scene where Amanda Bynes, playing a girl pretending to be her brother, screws up her face to stridently declare in a cartoonishly male voice, “I am a dude. I am a hunky dude! I’m a badass hunky dude!” was not lauded for being an example of comic excellence. OK, maybe you’re not wondering that but I certainly am. This is one of the most spectacular moments of hilarity in She’s the Man, the 2006 adaptation of William Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night, a stone-cold teen comedy classic that deserves far more recognition than the mediocre reviews gave it. She’s the Man is a high-spirited repurposing of The Bard’s gender-bending play which situates the action at a posh American high school where its female protagonist Viola (Bynes) has taken the place of her brother Sebastian, who is secretly awol for two weeks in London, so she can play on the boy’s football (soccer) team after her own school’s girls team is cut. As with the play, chaos ensues thanks to mistaken identities, misunderstandings and physical comedy that climaxes with a big event, in this case, two big events (a football match and a debutante ball) and ultimately a happy ending for the central players. Is it believable that Viola would get away with her disguise for so long given the circumstances of her deceit? Of course not! Just as it’s completely unbelievable that Portia could get away with pretending to be a knowledgable judge in front of her new husband Bassanio in Michael Radford’s 2004 adaptation of The Merchant of Venice. But that’s Shakespeare! One has to suspend one’s disbelief in order to enjoy his brand of comedy and the writers and cast of She’s the Man understood that so well. Had Bynes not gone on to struggle with fame and the toxic spotlight under which many a child actor has withered, her name might have been ranked alongside Melissa McCarthy or Kate McKinnon for her excellent understanding of slapstick comedy. So much of what makes this movie pop is the frenetic energy she brings while navigating the line between masculine and feminine in disguise as Sebastian: the way she takes apart a tampon and pops it in her nose to save face in front of her teammates or her inconsistent accent that makes every line delivery a Russian roulette for ridiculousness. Similar to Sanaa Lathan in Love &amp; Basketball and Parminder Nagra in Bend It Like Beckham, she maintains the lovable, relatable appeal of a girl just wanting a level playing field to achieve her dreams and date a dude who supports that. That dude is Channing Tatum playing Duke Orsino. At 26, Tatum looked far too old to play a teenager but still had enough boyish charm and awkwardness to set him up as a non-threatening leading man for the film’s young teen demographic to lust after. Co-writers Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith had already primed this audience for more palpable feminist messaging with their acclaimed 1999 adaptation of The Taming of the Shrew, 10 Things I Hate About You. Their progressive reconfiguration of the central romantic story, heavily influenced by the Riot Grrrl feminism of the 90s, laid the groundwork for She’s the Man to explore and dismantle antiquated ideas about masculinity and femininity. Of course, both films are very white, heteronormative depictions of young love, as were the factory settings for Hollywood high school films at the time. The latter could certainly have better understood the rules of football (I’m sure Vinnie Jones was livid with that second-half substitution plot device) and the writers probably didn’t need to borrow its boob-flashing gender reveal from the earlier gender-swapping teen comedy Just One of the Guys. Still, She’s the Man manages to deliver an important questioning of the toxic social norms that dictate how men and women are meant to act or be treated, at a time when young women in the media, like Bynes and fellow former Disney stars Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan, were frequently being tarred by a misogynistic brush. It’s a shame Bynes would struggle with her own self-image after seeing herself in the role. “I went into a deep depression for four to six months because I didn’t like how I looked when I was a boy,” she told Paper in 2018 and you have to wonder if she would have felt that way had the film been received by critics as well as its target demographic. Many male critics skewered Bynes’s effeminate representation of manhood rather than focusing on why Viola’s impression of manhood, which is dismissive of women and male emotions, is initially so toxic. Not since Tootsie has a gender-swapping comedy challenged the subject with quite so much comedic vigor, emotional heart and both male and female empowerment. She’s the Man is available to rent in the US and UK	942
This scruffy British-made comedy-horror, helmed by debut director Darren Berry, features a large ensemble cast with an extremely wide range of acting skills. Sadly, just as the story itself turns on how each individual’s flaws endanger the whole team, the same goes for the movie itself: thudding line readings and embarrassing bursts of overacting sully the better work on display. But maybe it’s a fool’s errand to expect much better from a film about a team of paintballers, all friends from a secondary school who graduated in 2004, being murdered one by one in comically grotesque ways in a tatty woodland area near a quarry. The makers have cited British comedy-horror features Hot Fuzz and Dog Soldiers as touchstones. Knowing that at least serves to help viewers appreciate how deftly the writer-directors of those earlier films, Edgar Wright and Neil Marshall, balance comic timing and tension-building, while coaxing good performances. But even they might have struggled with mayhem on a paintball course, a daft premise that isn’t exploited as well as it might have been – given how innately silly this mock military pastime is, one so beloved of middle-management types and macho-minded suburbanites. But at least Natasha Killip, as a filthy-mouthed, evil-tempered glamour model, and Aoife Smyth as a perpetually stoned fan of the Fast and the Furious franchise are around to perk up the scenes they’re in with well-timed insult comedy and stream-of-consciousness monologues about Vin Diesel and Paul Walker. Reliably funny comedian Katy Brand is also good for a few laughs as one of the paintball course’s marshals, especially when she is found lying irritably on the ground with half her intestines pulled out. The rest of the cast seems to consist mostly of interchangeable bearded white guys. • Paintball Massacre is released on 5 April on digital formats.	340
Lume (Adriana Matoshi) and her husband Ilir (Astrit Kabashi) managed to survive the late 90s war in Kosovo, but suffered the unthinkable loss of their young daughter, Zana, who was killed in crossfire. The years have passed on the farm where they live with Ilir’s formidable mother Remzije (Fatmire Sahiti), and the waters of everyday routine have flowed back into the scars. But Lume cannot let go of the past. Although seemingly the good, submissive little wifey that this close-knit, extremely old-fashioned society expects her to be, she’s racked with sorrow, and suffers from constant nightmares, featuring images that range from disturbing and bloody to downright David Lynchian, full of shadows and veiled figures backlit by moonlight. Remzije is pressuring Ilir to consider taking a second wife so that he can sire more children now that Lume can’t seem to get pregnant. In desperation, Lume agrees to see faith healers: the first, a witchy but wise woman in their own village; the second, a more sinister character who charges €500 per consultation and is prone to diagnosing demonic possession. Kosovan writer-director Antoneta Kastrati draws deep from the wells of both her homeland’s tragedy and her own in this disturbing, unnerving story. The flecks of horror in the way she handles some of the nightmare imagery may trigger some viewers to expect a different outcome from the deep drink of bleak we finally get served. Zana is a tough watch, but Matoshi’s fine-grained performance is a blessing to watch and there are incidental pleasures, particularly in the way the film languishes in the sultry, cruelly fecund landscape. On an anthropological level, there is something especially fascinating about this insider’s view of Kosovo society, where archaic beliefs about family mores rub up against people watching YouTube to learn new recipes for family meals. • Zana is on digital platforms from 2 April.	361
There are fascinating stories to be told about how the bestselling YA adventure The Knife of Letting Go mutated into much-delayed big screen misstep Chaos Walking. There’s an original script by Charlie Kaufman, umpteen drafts from a string of other writers soon after, a bloated $100m budget, reshoots from a different director and a hot young cast who aged quickly as the film spent over three years in the edit. Tales of strife and struggle, all of which would be more compelling than the final film itself, a delayed, mostly drab, attempt to cash in on the post-Hunger Games thirst to watch dystopian tales of attractive yet grubby young people rallying against the system. It’s a film that should have been a major disaster but ends up being just a minor one instead, watchable enough in parts, with the lowest of expectations, but not enough to warrant the time and money that’s been funnelled into it. The biggest problem that the director Doug Liman (no stranger to tortured productions or cursed pandemic movies) has is trying to visualise the main conceit from Patrick Ness’s novel, a tricky idea that might have worked on page but on the big screen, it’s dead on arrival. In the nearish future, a community of men live as part of the New World, left to their own devices after all of the women were killed by the Spackle, a race of malevolent aliens. Each man is followed by his own “noise”, a mist of thoughts and fears that must be controlled or will reveal their innermost secrets to those around. Local boy Todd (Tom Holland) struggles to do this, to maintain his privacy, a problem that gets out of hand when a crash landing leaves a young woman in his sights. Viola (Daisy Ridley) is immediately seen as a threat by the men as women don’t have the same noise surrounding them and she is soon targeted by the town’s flamboyant, and ferocious, mayor, David (Mads Mikkelsen having some sneery fun). Forced to flee, Todd decides to join her as they make their way over unknown terrain, finding out that the truths they held dear might not be true at all. There are many things that slightly miss the mark here, from the underwritten huh-who-what-why characters to the under-explained specifics of the world around them, but nothing is quite as jarringly off target as the visualised streams of consciousness, confusing throughout, ugly at times and when a crowd of men are thinking at once, extremely annoying. Closely resembling the look of the shimmer from Alex Garland’s adaptation of Annihilation, it’s an ungainly blue and purple maelstrom of faces, words and ideas that’s so astoundingly misbegotten that it crushes the film from the start. It’s not necessarily Liman’s fault per se – I’d be hard-pressed to figure out how anyone could have made it work – but it’s a niggling problem that affects almost every scene and, along with many other elements, ensures that this franchise won’t stretch past its first chapter. There’s such darkness to the set-up but the film avoids confronting difficult questions and Liman hopes we might stop asking them if there’s enough running and jumping to distract us. For that, Holland and Ridley are solid enough, both comfortable within physically active franchise fodder by now, but they’re left undernourished by a script that never bothers to give either of them the vaguest of characterisation and so a dynamic between the pair never really materialises. The exhaustingly redrafted script means that there are characters who come and go, embodied by talented actors, but who don’t make enough sense, leaving one tempted to check Ness’s source material for clarity (David Oyelowo’s fiery preacher is a particular casualty). The lush green world is pretty to look at and there’s an expensive scope to the film but too much of the styling is YA Dystopia 101 and so it never feels like anything we haven’t seen before. The scrappy final act is made even scrappier when you see how much older Holland and Ridley look in the clearly reshot scenes (Liman worked with the Don’t Breathe director Fede Álvarez on these) and the epilogue, shot almost two years after the rest of the film, is an almost comically clumsy way to close out one of the pandemic’s clumsiest offerings. Chaos Lumbering would be more fitting. Chaos Walking is out in the US on 5 March and in the UK on 2 April on digital platforms.	874
Producers for this year’s Oscars ceremony are said to be considering relaxing their policy of mandatory in-person attendance for this year’s nominees. According to a story in the Hollywood Reporter, the Academy has invited all nominees to participate in a Tuesday morning Zoom “conversation with show producers” Steven Soderbergh, Stacey Sher and Jesse Collins. This will include “updates about the show” as well as details on options should they need to participate remotely. Earlier this month, producers had said there would “not be an option to Zoom in for the show” and that nominees should turn up instead at Los Angeles’ Union Station, where this year’s ceremony will primarily take place. While most of this year’s nominees are based in the US, concern had been raised over the finances, logistics and safety of those based elsewhere flying to Los Angeles for the ceremony on 25 April. England has currently banned non-essential international travel until mid-May, although work exemptions are in place as evidenced by performers such as Harry Styles attending the Grammy awards earlier this month. Representatives of the five international feature films – submitted by Denmark, Hong Kong, Romania, Tunisia and Bosnia – could also face hurdles getting to Los Angeles. Speaking to the Guardian, Alexander Nanau, the director of Romanian film Collective, which is nominated for both best documentary and best international feature film, said: “We certainly hope to be there – provided it’s safe and logistics allow – but we trust the Academy will find a solution to accommodate nominees who face difficult travel restrictions.” Visitors to California are currently expected to quarantine for 10 days, incurring considerable expense and inconvenience, while the re-entry requirements for travellers back to their own countries vary widely. In some countries, visa offices remain closed.	340
Sharon Stone had her breasts augmented without her consent during reconstructive surgery, the actor has claimed. Stone says she woke from a 2001 operation to reconstruct her breasts following the removal of benign tumours to find they had increased in size, because the doctor felt she “would look better with bigger, ‘better’ boobs”. “When I was unbandaged, I discovered that I had a full cup-size bigger breasts, ones that he said ‘go better with your hip size’,” Stone writes in her new memoir, which is quoted in an interview in the Times. “He had changed my body without my knowledge or consent.” The incident is one of a number of upsetting episodes detailed by Stone, now 63, in her book, The Beauty of Living Twice. Stone says she and her sister, Kelly, were sexually abused as children by their grandfather, Clarence Lawson, with whom both girls were locked in a room for some time. Lawson died when Stone was 14. She writes: “I poked him, and the bizarre satisfaction that he was at last dead hit me like a ton of ice. I looked at [Kelly] and she understood; she was 11, and it was over.” Stone also gave further details on how she felt she had been misled into an explicit shot in thriller Basic Instinct. The actor said that she was “tricked into removing her underwear” for the famed police-interrogation scene, after being told that it “reflected the light” and assured her genitalia would not be seen. The actor only discovered this was not the case when she was called to see the final version of the film “not on my own with the director, as one would anticipate, given the situation that has given us all pause, so to speak, but with a room full of agents and lawyers, most of whom had nothing to do with the project”. The actor continued: “Yes, there have been many points of view on this topic, but since I’m the one with the vagina, in question, let me say: The other points of view are bullshit. It was me and my parts up there.” Stone’s memoir recounts numerous episodes of misbehaviour at the hands of men in Hollywood, but the actor has recently defended Woody Allen, with whom she worked three times, saying she had “a super-professional and a particularly wonderful experience working with him.” “I never had an untoward experience with Woody Allen,” Stone said. “My experiences with Woody Allen were all wonderful, he was highly professional with me. He was extraordinarily encouraging to me and I was a young woman, 19 when I started working with him.” “He’s been nothing but spectacular with me. I have no experience of him being anything but terrific,” Stone said. “I am fully aware of the documentary that’s come out recently, but I have zero of those experiences to report.” Stone has said she hopes the stories she outlines in her new book will help all actors who have felt harassed and violated on set and elsewhere. She writes: “I know that all of these women and men who have been harassed, been raped, had their jobs held for ransom, and been sexually tormented deserve their day in court. I know that to be true. I know that all of the unprocessed rape kits on police shelves everywhere must be processed so that crimes can be solved. This inaction is a true and real crime in itself.”	679
The fundamental creepiness of hotels is the driving force behind this very potent supernatural mystery-thriller from Iranian-American film-maker Kourosh Ahari: the creepiness of their deserted corridors, their stately or shabby lobbies, and their anonymous rooms, whose blankness keeps the secret of their previous occupants. It’s a creepiness that predates and is independent of Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining, though that’s admittedly an influence here. In modern-day Los Angeles, a young Iranian couple with a baby – Babak (Shahab Hosseini) and Neda (Niousha Noor) – are at a dinner party with friends in an unfamiliar part of town. They are tired and quarrelsome on the way home; Babak is really too drunk to drive, and Neda has lost her licence after an earlier run-in with a traffic cop, so they grumpily decide to check in to the nearest hotel. This turns out to be the Hotel Normandie (perhaps calling it “Hotel California” would have been too on-the-nose). The sinister receptionist of this odd establishment (George Maguire) tells them he only has a suite available: irritable and impatient, Babak takes it. So it is extremely disturbing for them to discover that they are in fact the hotel’s only guests, which moreover leaves them unable to explain the sudden heartstopping thumps on the door and the children crying for their mummy outside their room. Are they being haunted by some awful presence in the hotel, or by the festering secrets and lies in their own relationship? All these are ingredients for the kind of scary movie that’s usually a terrible cliche, and to be fair, there’s nothing obviously new about The Night. But it is put together with great style, force and visual imagination, and Ahari deftly uses the couple’s baby to ratchet up the tension. Uniformed authority figures, initially disturbing or intimidating, suddenly profess themselves to be entranced by the baby and ask if they may hold her – and somehow the couple can’t find a polite way of saying no. It delivers a clammy shiver of disquiet. • The Night is released on 2 April on digital platforms.	404
Chet Hanks, son of the Hollywood actor Tom Hanks, has been criticized for using a “racist” font on his new collection of merchandise which is also controversially called White Boy Summer. His black and white range of clothes, which include hoodies, T-shirts, shorts, tank tops, leggings, caps and bike shorts, has been called out online for its use of a Gothic-style font that is close to the one used by white nationalists. It’s also similar to the Fraktur fonts, which were used in Nazi Germany most prominently on the cover of Hitler’s Mein Kampf book. “Hmm unfortunately the merch looks aggressively racist,” wrote one commentator on Twitter, while another wrote: “Jesus. When I think of typefaces white people should avoid, anything remotely calligraphic/blackletter looking pops immediately to mind, especially if it’s going to include the word ‘White’.” While on Hanks’s official Instagram a user said: “Proud Boys are gonna buy these tf up.” The Proud Boys are a far-right US group and in September fashion line Fred Perry withdrew their polo shirts which had been adopted by them. Hanks, who raps under the moniker Chet Haze and has acted in the TV shows Shameless and Empire, came up with the term “White Boy Summer” on Friday – a play on the Megan Thee Stallion song from 2019 Hot Girl Summer. “I just got this feeling man that this summer … it’s about to be a white boy summer,” he said. “Take it how you want, I’m not talking about Trump, Nascar-type white. I’m talking about me, (rappers) Jon B. Jack Harlow-type white boys, you know what I mean? Let me know if you guys can vibe with that, and get ready. ‘Cause I am.’” In a video posted a few days later, he clarified: “You know what’s not White Boy Summer … is having any ill will or prejudice towards anybody from a different background, race, walk of life than you.” On Tuesday Hanks announced he was also launching a range of Black Queen Summer merchandise, using the same font. “I want to see some white boys and some black queens wearing each other’s shirts,” he said in a video introducing them. Hanks, who previously went viral in January of 2020 for using a Jamaican accent at the Golden Globes when his father won the Cecil B DeMille Award, is launching an online acting class The Actors Advantage on Monday. The Guardian approached him for comment.	496
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (Ampas) has backtracked on its no-Zoom rule for the Oscars after complaints from nominees based outside the US, and is instead reported to be setting up European “hubs” so those unable to travel to the ceremony in Los Angeles because of Covid regulations can participate. The organisers of the Oscars show, including the Ocean’s Eleven director, Steven Soderbergh, had earlier said it would “not be an option [for nominees] to Zoom in for the show”, due to be held in April. But according to the Hollywood Reporter, in a group call with all nominees the producers outlined plans to set up venues in London and Paris as uncertainty prevailed over travel restrictions. Soderbergh reportedly apologised for the lack of transparency over the issue, and stressed the fluidity of arrangements, but said of Zoom participation: “We hope it doesn’t come to that.” The producers encouraged everyone who can to travel to Los Angeles for the event, but acknowledged that quarantine regulations would make it difficult. Los Angeles county now requires a 10-day quarantine for visitors. The event’s Covid consultant, Dr Erin Bromage, said a testing facility specifically for the Oscars had been established. The Academy has been contacted for comment. Ampas had initially resisted any remote participation in its Oscars show, particularly after technical hitches caused problems at the Golden Globes. The producers originally told participants in the repeatedly delayed ceremony: “We are going to great lengths to provide a safe and enjoyable evening for all of you in person, as well as for all the millions of film fans around the world, and we feel the virtual thing will diminish those efforts.” The producers said nominees and their guests would gather at a courtyard in the Union railway station, while other show elements would be held live inside the Dolby theatre about eight miles (13km) away. However, a significant number of nominees, including the Promising Young Woman star Carey Mulligan and the film’s writer-director, Emerald Fennell, are based in the UK, which has banned all non-essential travel (though exemptions, including for work, are permitted). Other high-profile names who may be affected include Anthony Hopkins, Gary Oldman and Riz Ahmed (nominated for best actor), Olivia Colman (nominated for best supporting actress) and Sacha Baron Cohen, who is nominated for best adapted screenplay for Borat Subsequent Moviefilm and best supporting actor for The Trial of the Chicago 7. Nominees for best international film are also likely to be affected, with film-makers from Romania, Denmark and Bosnia in the running. The Oscars ceremony had originally been scheduled to take place on 28 February, but in June 2020 Ampas announced the event would be delayed by two months and the eligibility criteria adjusted, including allowing the nomination of films released on streaming platforms. The nature of the ceremony has also changed radically, with Soderbergh reportedly describing it to nominees as a “kind of a cocktail party, essentially”, with “nominees … rotated throughout the evening so we don’t exceed the limit”. The red carpet area, a tradition of the Oscar walk-in, has also been reconfigured, with Soderbergh saying: “There will be red stuff on the ground as you walk past [Union] station.” Ampas is aiming to hold up the TV audience for the Oscars, which in 2020 hit the lowest ever recorded figures in the US of 23.6 million viewers. The host network, ABC, which is thought to pay about $75m (£55m) a year on a contract that runs until 2028, recently put substantial pressure on Ampas to reinvigorate the show after years of declining audience figures.	699
“My day has 26 hours,” says Rainer Werner Fassbinder to a lover in this biopic. But even an extra two per day could hardly explain this director’s superhuman work rate, with dozens of movies, TV dramas and plays over a 20-year career in the 1960s and 70s – which coincided with nonstop emotional and sexual chaos, overeating, over-drinking, over-shouting and massive cocaine intake. Fassbinder was one of the few directors – or creative artists, full stop – who was a genuine bohemian, a sensualist, an anarchist and a real “disruptor”, a term that in our blander age applies to business gurus and political advisors. Oskar Röhler has created a heartfelt and appropriately awestruck portrait of the bleary Byron of the German new wave, but it’s a bit of a one-note portrayal: a fierce but aggressive study of Fassbinder, played by Oliver Masucci. Röhler covers Fassbinder’s career in an epic series of frenzied scenes, rehearsal room confrontations, press conference flounces and bathhouse hookups, presented on theatrical and stylised sets. Masucci and Röhler portray Fassbinder as an inspired creative sadist with his cowering cast and crew, treating them mean, keeping them keen, and forming passionate attachments to rough trade guys that he put in his movies and then cast aside, with tragic results. In this film, it’s an aggressively dysfunctional approach that depends on mounting a continuous display of defiant browbeating – and an escalating intake of booze and coke, which resulted in Fassbinder’s fatal heart attack in his late 30s. In some ways, the toweringly outrageous film-maker that Röhler imagines here is the male version of the woman he mythologised in his excellent breakthrough movie No Place to Go: the socialist grande dame Hanna (based on the director’s mother), who is devastated by the fall of the Berlin Wall. Fassbinder is not devastated in any sense; he is fanatically productive, although towards the end the terrible cost is (belatedly) shown. He behaved appallingly towards El Hedi ben Salem (Erdal Yildiz), the Moroccan man he had sex with in a Paris club and cast in his great film Fear Eats the Soul from 1974. The same goes for Armin Meier (Jochen Schropp), the former butcher whose unhappy life partly inspired his Fox and His Friends (1975). This film vividly conjures up the shabby, cigarette-ashy world: the West Germany of radical chic and revolutionary paranoia. Röhler interestingly conveys the absurdity of sex, with men standing around in very unsexy underpants – although the theatrical situations are sometimes absurd, in ways that reminded me of the plays of Ernie Wise. There is not much about the softer side to Fassbinder, or about his Sirkian sympathy for female characters and female stars, who are not much more than ciphers here. But it gives you a good idea of what a nightmare he must have been to work for, and the 24/7 tumult that drove his work. Fassbinder was the nearest an auteur came to punk rock. • Enfant Terrible is released on 2 April on BFI Player.	581
Original? Nah. You could put this grim, unimaginative London crime drama under a microscope and still not find the teensiest speck of originality. It’s a nasty little film, shallow and badly acted, with a queasy macho streak – like a Guy Ritchie, only without the subtlety or attention to female characters. Original Gangster follows the rise of a hitman and begins with his backstory. As a 10-or-so-year-old, Castor (Badger Skelton) is spared death by Milo (Ian Reddington), a thug who murders his parents. For the next decade, orphaned Castor lives rough in London parks, eating cold beans out of the tin and honing his mugging skills; this is a film where men commit violence in swaggering slo-mo, music blaring. The illiterate voiceover feels like a parody: “The street was a money-hungry whore who demanded paying before providing me with her sweet pussy.” Nice. Skip ahead a decade, and Castor (played by Alex Mills with the charisma of a toaster), runs into Milo again. Milo is now a successful drug dealer who introduces Castor to American crime kingpin Jean-Baptiste (a career low from Steve Guttenberg). Milo also invites Castor round for dinner at his gaff, where we see him humiliate and physically assault his much younger wife (Isabele De Rosa). The film has a serious woman problem. Its female characters are either dead and saintly, or nags who get hit by men. In one scene, Castor is drinking alone in a graveyard when a young woman angrily tells him to move on. (Which completely misjudges the response of most women to being alone in a space with a lairy drunk man twice her size). When Castor calls her “darling” she rants at him: “Do you know nothing about the #MeToo movement, you misogynist pig?” So he thumps her. Thirty minutes later, the script wants you to root for him as love interest to Milo’s wife, herself a victim of violence. Do me a favour. • Original Gangster is released on 5 April on digital platforms and DVD.	399
Any movie that reminds us of the ongoing civil rights scandal at the US’s extrajudicial detention camp at Guantánamo Bay should be a good thing: it’s still open for business right now, with 40 prisoners inside. The same goes for any reminder of the 9/11 terrorist outrage and the backlash of furious revenge it was designed to provoke, implanting a virus of rage and fear that threatens to live on in the American bloodstream like malaria. But I was disappointed by this well-meaning movie, based on the true story of Mohamedou Ould Slahi from Mauritania in north-west Africa. A former muhajideen anti-communist fighter in Afghanistan in the 1990s, he was picked up and handed over to the US authorities after 9/11 (with the Mauritanian government’s permission) and kept at Guantánamo Bay without charge or trial for a staggering 14 years, from 2002 to 2016; he was released when the state finally accepted his confessions were valueless, having been obtained through torture. The film is adapted by screenwriters MB Traven, Rory Haines and Sohrab Noshirvani from Slahi’s book, Guantánamo Diary, published in 2015 while he was still inside: the scribbled pages regularly handed to his lawyer Nancy Hollander. Franco-Algerian star Tahar Rahim plays Slahi; Jodie Foster plays Hollander and Shailene Woodley is her associate, Teri Duncan. Benedict Cumberbatch plays the crewcut military prosecutor Lt Col Stuart Couch, who was pretty gung-ho about getting the death penalty for his man until he realised that it meant relying on torture and disregarding the constitution and the rule of law. So far, so admirable. But with this movie, we are plunged right back into the exasperating 9/11 fence-sitting handwringer genre that was fashionable in the 00s: conscience-stricken films that invited us to sympathise with their liberal agony, such as Robert Redford’s Lions for Lambs (2007), Gavin Hood’s Rendition (2007) and Stephen Gaghan’s Syriana (2005). The Mauritanian is a movie that appears to be comprised entirely of good guys: Slahi himself is a good guy, of course, and so naturally are Hollander and Duncan, doggedly ploughing through the boxes of legal documents that the authorities allow them to see, and persistently asking for more. But the chief prosecutor Couch is a good guy as well, troubled with his finally overwhelming qualms of conscience as a true patriot. (Hollander and Couch are shown having a reasonably cordial beer together at the Guantánamo visitors’ cafe.) Finally, Slahi gets his day in court in which, with stirring music on the soundtrack, he praises American TV shows such as Ally McBeal and American justice itself. So with all these potent good guys effectively rooting for the prisoner, why did he stay banged up for so long? There are no major players on the bad guy team here: authoritarian meanies are permitted on screen on condition that they are dramatically dominated by a liberal convert: Cumberbatch. There is nothing and no one in this film with the dramatic status of, say, Jack Nicholson’s ferociously unrepentant Colonel Nathan Jessup in A Few Good Men, scripted by Aaron Sorkin, and there is no “you can’t handle the truth” moment. There is just official silence from the authorities and the drama itself; a sombre announcement flashes up on screen that Slahi stayed in Guantánamo for six years after the prosecution collapsed in 2010 – by order of the Obama government. As for Slahi himself, he doesn’t seem bitter about the US nor Mauritanian authorities by the end of the picture; he doesn’t wish to take action against them, yet neither does he explicitly forgive them. It’s opaque and frustrating. Rahim gives a perfectly decent performance and everyone else does an honest job. Slahi himself is throroughly entitled to his own happy ending, cheerfully listening to Bob Dylan over the closing credits. But this movie is content with congratulating itself for being on the right side of history, with little attention paid to questions unanswered and history unresolved. • The Mauritanian is released on 19 February in the US, and in the UK on 2 April on digital platforms.	778
Idris Elba has always been a charismatic screen presence, so it’s no surprise that he cuts a very fine figure on horseback. Elba is the producer-star of this emotionally heartfelt, unusual, if somewhat sucrose urban western. Ricky Staub, the director of several well-liked short films, here makes his feature debut, and with screenwriter Dan Walser he has adapted the 2011 YA novel Ghetto Cowboy by Greg Neri which is centred around the urban-equestrian tradition in Philadelphia, where the Fletcher Street stables have long nurtured young riders. The Hollywood image of cowboys is white people in stetsons riding around huge open countryside. This film shows us that’s not the whole story: there’s an alternative African-American tradition. Caleb McLaughlin (who plays Lucas in TV’s Stranger Things) is Cole, a very troubled kid in Detroit who has been kicked out of school for fighting. His now desperate mum sends him away to live with his estranged dad in North Philadelphia; this is Harp, played by Elba, who is mostly to be seen gathered round a campfire with his friends in the evening, for all the world as if they are riding the range in a different century to this one. Harp runs the urban stables — with real live actual horses in the city streets — and he’s a difficult, truculent, suspicious man, astonished to realise he is being asked to step up and face his paternal responsibilities. And he has a lot on his plate: developers and gentrifiers are poised to buy out his stables. As for Cole, he himself is astonished to see that one of these horses actually lives in Harp’s ramshackle house: a situation with comic possibilities that this basically serious film does not want to follow up. Cole doesn’t like the discipline of having to muck out the stables and he doesn’t like Harp yelling at him — Elba’s husky, rumbling voice always so distinctive — and so finds himself hanging out with his old childhood friend Smush (Jharrel Jerome), a superficially likeable, unreliable guy who is into some serious gang stuff. Will moody, vulnerable Cole take the path of drugs and crime with Smush? Or will he take the tougher road of working with horses, the noble beasts who offer a miraculous kind of redemption, and a renewed relationship with his dad? Well, there are some classic horsey moments here — and I’m a sucker for them — including a scene when it is up to Cole to recapture and pacify one of the most difficult horses which has escaped. Just seeing Elba, McLaughlin and the rest of the cast riding horses around the streets of North Philadelphia, moseying through that tough cityscape, is enough to bring a smile to your face. The flaw in the movie is how it is going to treat the figure of Smush. The film seems ultimately to want to reclaim Smush, not merely as a troubled kid whose destiny could have been that of so many others, but also as someone with a connection to horses, which has hardly been established by the rest of the story. This is an old-fashioned father-son story and none the worse for that, but there is something a little slick and subdued about the way the story is resolved. •Concrete Cowboy is released on 2 April on Netflix.	629
A year after Richard Lester’s A Hard Day’s Night, and a year before the Monkees were grown in TV’s pop culture lab, director John Boorman made his feature debut with this very English madcap pop lark from 1965, scripted by Peter Nichols and starring the Dave Clark Five as themselves. Or almost. They’re not supposed to be musicians, but rather stunt-men who live together in a wacky shared flat (evidently a converted church organ loft) that is dominated by gigantic posters of the sort generally collected by wealthy pop-art enthusiasts. Dave Clark plays handsome Steve, first among equals in the gang, and they’re filming a TV commercial for the meat-marketing board starring It -girl and supermodel Dinah (Barbara Ferris). She’s so important she has a bodyguard on the set, who frowningly reads The Naked Lunch. Dinah has a crush on Steve, and the couple impulsively decide to abandon the shoot, pinching the production’s E-type Jag and going on the run together for zany 60s-style misadventures – an escapade cynically exploited for publicity by Leon (played by silvery-voiced David de Keyser) who is the UK’s meat supremo and also apparently Dinah’s creepy sugar-daddy. This film is amiably daft, pretty clunky and dated, but a very potent time-capsule for the 1960s: like the early movies of Godard, it is obsessed with the language of publicity: advertising, magazines, the mass media. Yootha Joyce has a ripe cameo as an older woman who takes an interest in our Steve – though without pressing her attentions in ways that would have taken this film out of the teen/family entertainment bracket – and there is an odd scene in which Dinah and Steve warily encounter some grumpy hippies in a ruined building; here Britcom fans will enjoy the appearance of Sheila Fearn (Terry’s sister in The Likely Lads). An archival frisson. • Catch Us If You Can is released on 5 April on digital formats.	374
There’s an increasingly wariness of slavery dramas. Must suffering always be the lens on Black lives? On the other hand though, the success of Get Out has Hollywood excited about the genre flick’s potential to interrogate America’s oldest, truest horror. Caught in the middle is Antebellum, starring Janelle Monáe: a film that attempts so much and fails at almost all of it. Debut writer-directors Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz offer an early display of proficiency with a tracking shot across an old south plantation: the “big house”, the cotton fields, the Spanish moss and the slave quarters, all handsomely bathed in the magic-hour glow and, later, by flickering candlelight. Acts of violent suppression happen in balletic slo-mo, allowing time to observe that some period details seem strangely off. These hints culminate in a mobile ringtone that seems to shift Monáe’s character – apparently a brutalised slave called Eden – to a new reality. She fell asleep next to her rapist and enslaver, but she wakes up surrounded by her loving family in their comfortable home. “Eden” is now “Veronica”, a prominent sociologist in 21st-century US, whose high-flying career takes her to a speaking engagement in New Orleans, and dinner out with friends (Gabourey Sidibe among them). This is a better life, certainly, but it is progress depicted in the shallowest terms. Veronica’s supposedly nourishing friendships are nothing but stereotypical sass and self-care prattle; her supposedly fiery politics consist of strung-together platitudes. The Black woman at Antebellum’s centre is as one-dimensional as the evil white racists on its peripheries. When one of these commences a whipping by saying, “It brings me no joy to do this”, the claim rings doubly false. Antebellum offers neither a coherent social commentary nor – thanks to its pat, ahistorical ending – a revenge thriller’s catharsis. What else, besides entertainment, could its purpose be? • Antebellum is released on 2 April on Sky Cinema.	381
Minari is an east Asian herb, sometimes called water dropwort or water celery, grown in the wild and treasured by connoisseurs, a little like samphire grass in England. Its appearance in this movie is a sign of something mysterious and providential, an indication of good things coming from the soil. This is a wonderfully absorbing and moving family drama with a buttery, sunlit streak of sentimentality. Writer-director Lee Isaac Chung based it on his childhood growing up on a farm in Arkansas in the 1980s. Minari already has the look of a well-loved classic, whose every scene feels familiar and loved, and it has an amazing way of recreating childhood. Watching it, I remembered for the first time in decades what it was like as a kid to sit in the back of a hot, stationary car in those days before air-conditioning, waiting for your mum and dad with the sun beating down, maybe a wisp of wind through the open window, and the hot plastic seats sticking to your bare legs. Steven Yeun gives a piercingly intelligent performance as Jacob, a Korean incomer to the United States in the Reagan era; he and his wife, Monica (Han Ye-ri), and their two kids, elder daughter Anne (Noel Cho) and little son David (Alan Kim), have arrived in Arkansas from California, where Jacob had been making a joyless but reliable factory wage in chicken hatcheries. Jacob has a big dream: he will farm the land here, and get rich growing real Korean vegetables for the many Korean immigrants in the US yearning for a taste of home. But Monica is already disappointed with this new, hard life he has given them. Han plays her brilliantly, as proud and self-contained as an exiled princess. She has persuaded Jacob to let her mother come from Korea to live with them, ostensibly to help look after the children but also because Monica needs a real adult friend. Youn Yuh-jung is marvellous as the cantankerous and outspoken “grandma” who has brought over creature comforts, including minari seeds, and Monica’s emotion on seeing her mum for the first time in years is almost unbearable. Jacob gets on with the hard business of sowing and reaping, with the help of a devout Christian who has learning challenges called Paul (Will Patton), and has to ignore the faultlines in their marriage and worries about young David’s health. Inevitably, Jacob’s crops begin to fail, and we see him as his children see him: working backbreakingly hard and suppressing his panic about money. Poor, tense Jacob achieves something like the status of Pa in Little House on the Prairie or Gérard Depardieu’s Jean de Florette, longing for the rain that will save his crops. It is agonising to watch him almost crippled with work and then arguing with Monica, and heart-rending to watch the kids rush to their rooms to write out “Don’t Fight” on paper planes and desperately throw them into the room where their parents are screaming at each other. Rightly or wrongly, this also is the sort of movie where you spend some time waiting for the first racist remark. When will it come? At the bank, with the white manager? In church, with the white minister? At the hospital, with the white doctor? But it never happens like that, or at least only in a single nasty remark from a white child to David at a church social. (The importance of Christianity in Korean life is another underdiscussed movie theme aired here.) Even then, the kid and David immediately become friends. This is not a film about racial tensions: it is as if this family is so isolated that the whole question is irrelevant. All that’s important is the family, and its titanic struggles with the weather, with fate and each other. It is a film in which the details, the child’s-eye-view episodes, the calamities, the tenderly remembered touches, all sing together like a choir. • Minari is released on 2 April on digital platforms.	772
There is a certain slightly po-faced type of cineaste who cannot understand geek culture and Hollywood’s obsession with adapting fantasy TV shows, comics and old B-movies. Why would grownups flock to the multiplex to watch the latest Avengers flick when they could be taking in a daring, intellectual piece of arthouse? We can be assured the news that Hollywood is working on a big-screen remake of the sci-fi cartoon ThunderCats will go down about as well with this demographic as one of Snarf’s dodgy jokes. For those who remember the series, it debuted in 1985 and fits into the same broad category as He-Man and the Masters of the Universe: everything takes place on a magical planet beset by the local undead villain and his evil machinations. Masters of the Universe ended up being made into an incredibly disappointing Hollywood vehicle for Dolph Lundgren. I still remember sitting in a cinema in 1987 wondering how on Eternia the makers had managed to wrench all sense of joy and colour from the big-screen version. It’s bad movies like these that we recall every time there is news of a fresh Hollywood remake of something much-loved. But there are reasons to be cheerful about the proposed film. For a start ThunderCats was always better than He-Man: the animation, by Japanese studio Pacific Animation Corporation, was wonderfully crisp and stylised, the voicework (by a tiny team of close-knit actors) blending just the right mix of silly and serious. Yes, there were some far-out moments – Tygra’s apparent psychedelic trip, Lion-O heading into deep space without oxygen – and the quality of the writing rather dropped off a cliff in later seasons, but there were few 80s animated series to match it. This is important, because Godzilla vs Kong director Adam Wingard, who is taking on the project for Warner Bros, is promising to cleave as closely as possible to the original show. Perhaps the best news of all (particularly given what happened to Cats) is that there will be no attempt to render Lion-O, Cheetara et al in live action: the film will instead blend traditional animation with CGI. “This is a huge passion thing for me,” Wingard told Deadline.” “Nobody on this planet knows or has thought as much about ThunderCats as I have. They gave me the reins.” He continued: “I saw this as an opportunity to do a new type of fantasy sci-fi spectacle film that people have never seen before. It’s got a rich mythology, the characters are fantastic, the colours. I want to do a ThunderCats film that takes you back to that 80s aesthetic. I don’t want to reinvent the way they look; I want them to look like ThunderCats.” This is all pretty vital stuff, as there have been attempts before to bring back ThunderCats on the small screen that have failed miserably. A boldly rendered but slightly vapid 2011 reimagining was cancelled after one season, as was an attempt to remake the show as a zany, Teen Titans-style comedy last year. Neither could match the intensely vibrant animation style and killer voice work of the original. Perhaps, if we are lucky, Wingard will be able to harness the current hype that surrounds animated fantasy material – nobody is insisting that everything needs to be live action any more following the Oscar-winning success of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse – and return us to the version of Third Earth that lingers long in the memory.	649
If you dare to suggest that the live-action remake of Ghost in the Shell isn’t completely terrible, you’ll most likely receive a confused dog look from some film fans, while also having your sense of morality brought into question. The 2017 adaptation, directed by Rupert Sanders, was instantly dismissed by many when it was announced that Scarlett Johansson would be playing Major Mira Killian, who, in the original manga, anime films and TV series, was most definitely a young Japanese woman. The whitewashing controversy was then made infinitely worse when it was reported that the film-makers were planning on using CGI and other visual effects to make Johansson look Asian, which would have been biblically disastrous and unforgivable had they gone ahead with it – it was bad enough that it was even considered. The subsequent backlash was completely understandable and pretty much killed any chance of the film receiving positive reviews across the board. And it’s a shame, because Ghost in the Shell is far from the soulless Hollywood remake many expected and still claim it to be. It’s an absolute visual feast, complete with enthralling action scenes and a strongly adapted plot that – yes, I’m daring to say it – more than justifies its creative choices. Set in the near future, where the line between human and machine has faded so significantly that people are now knocking about with robotic limbs, internal organs and eyes, the plot follows Johansson’s Major, a cyborg supersoldier who investigates the suspicious occurrences surrounding her past. Naturally, she soon discovers that the company that placed her organic brain in a mechanical shell tore her away from her family and erased her memories. The real twist, however, is that Major actually was a Japanese woman before the evil tech people got their hands on her. For many, that reveal sparked even further outrage, but they weren’t particularly bothered about it in Japan, where some fans felt that the protagonist’s non-traditional appearance actually served the film’s themes of self-identity and the blurring of natural and mechanical bodies. After all, it’s quite literally a story about a young woman whose life and likeness is stripped away from her. Even Mamoru Oshii, the director of the anime films, argued that Major’s physical form was immaterial, since she wasn’t in her own body. “The Major is a cyborg and her physical form is an entirely assumed one,” he told IGN. “[Her name] and her current body are not her original name and body, so there is no basis for saying that an Asian actress must portray her.” The decision to set the film in a culturally ambiguous city, even though it was shot in Hong Kong, was also heavily criticised, but as producer Steven Paul explained, the intention was to create an “international world” with people of numerous nationalities – which makes a great deal of sense considering they’re meant to be part of a progressive, futuristic civilisation. Even if grotty strip clubs are still a thing. In any case, the furore surrounding this adaptation shouldn’t detract from the numerous things it gets right. Johansson is undeniably a natural in the role, playing her bionic character sufficiently cold, but never letting you forget that there’s a tormented human mind hiding behind her detachable face. And even though the story is ripped straight from the source material, the mystery of the main character’s past is still surprisingly engaging, with her real-life memories appearing in the form of cryptic “glitches”. Even Major’s trusty colleague Batou (Pilou Asbæk) is more fleshed out than you’d expect him to be, as he openly admits to the emptiness of his duty-bound life, as well as his endearing affinity towards stray dogs. A half-decent metaphor in a mainstream blockbuster? How dare they. Visually, that “international world” that the characters inhabit is stunningly realised, with giant holographic adverts standing as tall as the surrounding buildings, while low-angled shots of dingy apartment blocks add gritty texture. The opening sequence, in which Major’s synthetic body is constructed to the sound of Clint Mansell and Lorne Balfe’s faith-inspiring score, is neatly and respectfully adapted from the 1995 anime, and the kaleidoscopic, light-bending action scenes involving invisibility cloaks, slow-motion shattered glass and splashing water provide images worthy of framing and hanging up on your wall. It may not be as ambitious or profound as Blade Runner 2049, which was released in the same year, but with enough character depth and intrigue to back up the visuals, Ghost in the Shell is far from a hollow robot of a film. Ghost in the Shell is available to rent digitally in the US or on Netflix in the UK	907
“There can’t be two alphas,” insists Rebecca Hall’s Dr Ilene Andrews. Well, quite. Adam Wingard’s cleanly choreographed spin on the Japanese kaiju movie is vastly superior to 2019’s muddy Godzilla: King of the Monsters, pitting the radioactive lizard against ancient enemy King Kong and launching the latter into the Earth’s apparently hollow core. The spectacle is more involving than the plot, especially the dazzling image of Kong floating skyward, serene and surrounded by purple glowing rocks. Godzilla vs. Kong is on multiple platforms	105
There’s a promising setup to this claustrophobic survivalist horror-thriller, written by its co-star Matt Stokoe, who performs opposite his real-life partner Sophie Rundle. But despite some strong moments and a theme which speaks to these times of coronoviral anxiety, the film doesn’t quite work dramatically or gel emotionally, with some odd, strained mood-shifts and uncertain dialogue scenes between the three lead characters towards the end. Rundle and Stokoe play Rose and Sam, a couple who live hermit-like in a remote woodland shack, almost as if in some postapocalyptic dystopia, though it is supposed to be the present day. Rose must be intensively looked after because of a medical condition requiring her to stay indoors, and certain dietary requirements that mean Sam has to get leeches by mail order. She is a writer, working on a novel on an old-fashioned typewriter, and Sam gets food by setting traps for rabbits in the surrounding forest and growing vegetables (though they evidently have enough cash for their needs, presumably including electricity bills). But their tense existence is threatened by Sam’s furious dispute with the person who is supposed to be their point of contact with the outside world, and then by the arrival of Amber (Olive Gray), a troubled young woman on the run from problems of her own. You cannot find fault with any of the performances as such. But in narrative terms, Amber’s appearance out of the blue – an event unconnected to the apparent “Straw Dogs” situation developing with the guys with whom Sam had been previously doing business – and Rose and Sam’s subsequent, bafflingly changeable behaviour towards her, are unconvincing. This feels like a project that could have done with more script development, good though the actors are. Rose: A Love Story is released on 5 April on digital platforms.	348
You’ve got to admire wife and husband film-makers Tori and Matthew Butler-Hart. Stuck in their London flat at the start of the pandemic, the pair wrote a sci-fi script together: a Groundhog-Day-meets-The-Matrix tale of a woman trapped in a time loop. They shot it à deux on an iPhone; she stars, he directs. And there are a couple of cameos, from Ian McKellen and Game of Thrones actor Conleth Hill (who quite literally phoned in their performances from home). It’s a genuinely impressive achievement, but for a film about the infinite possibilities of parallel universes, it’s exasperatingly samey. Tori Butler-Hart is Jane, a woman who wakes up every morning tied to a chair in the attic of a London semi with no memory of how she got there. Outside, the streets are eerily quiet. Scared but resourceful, Jane finds a door hidden behind a pile of junk. A camera on the wall is watching – and from time to time the soundtrack picks up the voices of her observers, distorted and crackling. Jane’s lockdown ordeal is replayed over and over again with slightly different variations – in way that begins to feel more ad nauseam than infinitum. Every day she wakes up in the chair, and every day gets a little closer to freedom: down the stairs, out of the back door, into a car. Then something happens to terrify her and bang, it’s back in the chair. Appearances from McKellen (sporting a dapper lockdown beard) and Hill don’t add much. The pair play physicists from the Wytness Quantum Research Centre – the place Jane is trying to reach. They speak to camera, talking heads on a documentary, but, frustratingly, explain very little. What ideas are here never really come to life. Though perhaps in the future, the film will come to look like a lockdown time-capsule: a reminder of the fear and isolation of spring 2020, and the unnerving feeling of standing in empty streets in towns and cities as if the world has stopped. • Infinitum: Subject Unknown is out now on digital formats.	404
Rendered in supersaturated shades of mind-melting magenta, burnt-retina orange and eye-ache azure, this computer animated kids’ story (adapted from a German TV series called Der kleine Drache Kokosnuss) revolves around a somewhat socially divided community of dragons. In the strange taxonomy of this universe, there are flying Fire Dragons who can breathe fire, aquatic region-dwelling Water Dragons who speak a different language but know some pidgin English and, unaccountably, spiny-backed Gourmet Dragons who like to cook. There are also Fur Dragons and various other sorts, but for the purpose of this film the main characters are drawn from the ranks of the Fire and the Gourmet Dragons. They mostly peacefully co-exist in one seaside, although there are occasionally snarky comments about each other’s habits, suggesting that the respective groupings could be read as cultural or racial differences. Nevertheless, an effort to foster better inter-dragon harmony results in the organisation of a summer camp, so Fire Dragon hero Coconut and his best friend Oscar, a Gourmet Dragon, sail forth with chaperones for an island where Coconut’s grandfather remembers once meeting the exotic Water Dragons. They smuggle their friend Mathilda, a porcupine, in a box which just completely confuses things zoologically. In any event, there is a shipwreck, the Water Dragons seem none too friendly when first met, there are dragon-eating plants about and, worst of all, Oscar and Coconut have a disagreement. No one seems particularly worried about the fact that they’re all stranded on a desert island with no means of communicating with dragonkind across the water, but the ability to sing catchy little tunes about friendship sorts out everything. Altogether, this is a bit dull and baffling for anyone over the age of seven; but it’s largely inoffensive, maybe even laudable, with its relentlessly pro-tolerance happy-clappy message of love. I am still wondering why so many of the Fire Dragon characters are named after fruits while the Gourmet Dragons just have regular German names. And why is it called A Dragon’s Adventure (note the singular), instead of Dragons’ Adventure, since they all go on holiday, not just one dragon? • A Dragon’s Adventure is released on 2 April on digital platforms.	420
The thrill of an awards ceremony usually comes from seeing so much talent clustered in such a small space. Star after star, packed in tightly together, wearing their best clothes, all vying to give the wittiest, most memorable speech in the fanciest outfit. The actual awards are an afterthought. Or at least they were, because now Covid is a thing and awards ceremonies have had to adapt accordingly. If you saw this year’s Golden Globes – and pretty much nobody did – you will have seen what a sterile, remote oddity it was, plagued with glitches and awkwardness. The pandemic has completely changed the face of the awards ceremony as we know it. With this year’s excuse for an awards season about to hit full tilt, here’s a Covid Awards drinking game (soft drinks are available). Perfect to play as you judge the living rooms of A-list actors from your own, objectively worse, homes. Curated backgrounds Although the Oscars has promised no Zoom calls this year, it will just take one small surge in cases to ruin that plan. On the plus side, a video-conference Oscars would allow the nominees to augment their dresses with the best accessory of all: their Zoom background. Nothing gives more away about a person than the room they sit in as they accept an award. Is it grand and out of touch? Is it so self-consciously small that it comes off as falsely modest? Are the bookshelves full of important works, or pictures of their family, or other awards they have won? Are they just sitting in a blank white void, because their publicist told them not to give anything away about themselves? Drink if you spot a book you’ve read. Drink even more if you hated it, because that makes you better than them. Technical difficulties Otherwise known as Daniel Kaluuya Syndrome. If you saw the Golden Globes, you will have seen the mortifying moment where Daniel Kaluuya began his acceptance speech over Zoom, only to reveal that he’d accidentally put himself on mute. Will these issues be fixed in time for the rest of awards season, or will Brad Pitt’s “Unstable Connection” notification start blinking mid-joke? Will Aaron Sorkin vanish 40 minutes into the ceremony because he’s too cheap to upgrade to a pro account? Will Joaquin Phoenix appear onscreen as a giant oblivious cat, like that Texas lawyer did the other month? Drink whenever a presenter has to cover up for a technical hitch, or whenever you can hear a producer panicking, or when a comedian pretends to be on mute as a funny “joke”. Flat jokes Here’s a lesson we all learned during the Golden Globes. When a monologue mocks films in front of the people who made them, it comes off as good-natured joshing. But when the stars aren’t there, the same jokes can seem breathtakingly mean. With no audience to bounce off, and a tundra of scattered chuckles as a best possible response, joke-telling – as Tina Fey and Amy Poehler found – is riskier than ever this year. Maybe the best thing to do would be to just not tell any. Anyway, score a point whenever someone tells a joke to openly hostile silence. Total relaxation However they are held, either remotely or in reduced physical numbers, the full-bore razzmatazz of awards ceremonies this year will be heavily diluted, and this might trick people into letting their guard down slightly more than usual. For instance, Al Pacino definitely fell asleep during the Golden Globes. He definitely did. The cameras cut to him, and his eyes were closed and he looked very peaceful. He must have been asleep. Expect much more of this for the rest of the season. Maybe Anthony Hopkins will wander off for a sandwich, or Glenn Close will start picking her nose. Maybe Frances McDormand will start answering emails during her acceptance speech. Mainly, though, drink if anyone else falls asleep. Call it a sympathy drink. Emotionally void speeches As someone who has worked in newsrooms during awards ceremonies, I can tell you that the fastest way to make headlines is to use your acceptance speech to push a cause, be it wage equality like Patricia Arquette, climate change like Leonardo DiCaprio or just a nebulous grab-bag of vaguely bad things like Joaquin Phoenix. But will this happen this year? What issues can the winners draw our attention to? The pandemic? Unlikely, because we’re all really aware of the pandemic, thank you. Anything that isn’t the pandemic? Pipe down, idiot, there’s a pandemic on. I would suggest drinking whenever anyone uses the phrase “unprecedented times” – but I don’t want to be responsible for you having your stomach pumped.	909
When Nancy Hollander (Jodie Foster) arrives at Guantánamo Bay, she’s wearing sunglasses. Her chic white bob and blue button-down shirt are hardly provocative, but a guard advises her to wear a hijab anyway – the detainees have been known to spit at women. The moment recalls Foster’s trainee FBI agent Clarice Starling in The Silence of the Lambs, met with a different bodily fluid in the bowels of a psychiatric hospital. The Mauritanian, a post-9/11 legal drama based on Mohamedou Ould Slahi’s 2015 memoir Guantánamo Diary, is less concerned with the particular psychology of its incarcerated protagonist than with the political machinery that kept him behind bars without an official criminal charge for 14 years. The excellent Tahar Rahim (A Prophet) brings softness and seriousness to Slahi, but overripe flashbacks to his horrific torture are shot with a cartoonish edge. It’s a double bind: depict an interrogation scene too realistically and run the risk of torture porn, but veer too off-kilter and the effect is distancing. Here, the styling is at odds with the otherwise straightforward courtroom narrative. The prestige procedural elements work better; the real-life story is enraging, and it’s fun to see Benedict Cumberbatch’s morally conflicted military prosecutor lock horns with Foster’s icy human rights lawyer. • On Amazon Prime	249
Writer-director Christian Petzold (Transit) riffs on the German myth of the water nymph whose love of a man secures her an immortal human soul. Undine (Paula Beer) is a historian in a leather jacket, her red hair recalling another Little Mermaid. “If you leave me, I’ll have to kill you,” she warns boyfriend Johannes (Jacob Matschenz), as per the fairytale. He dumps her anyway. Soon enough she has a new beau, a gorgeous industrial diver named Christoph (Franz Rogowski). The force of their initial attraction causes a fish tank to explode, soaking them to the skin. Undine gives lectures on Berlin’s changing architecture; this allows for neat parallels between a city haunted by the spectre of history and – like a gender-flipped Vertigo – our heroine tethered to the ghost of her past love. There’s just enough magic and mystery to tease out a supernatural reading of the film, though Petzold encourages viewers to find pleasure in puzzling out his femme fatale for themselves.

The title of writer-director Lee Isaac Chung’s enchanting film about a Korean family making a new start in rural 80s Arkansas refers to the tenacious edible plant that we see taking root and flourishing by a shady creek. “It’s a poetic plant,” Chung has said, not least because it “will grow very strongly in its second season, after it’s died and come back”. That theme of death and rebirth runs throughout Chung’s drama, inspired by his own family history (the minari used onscreen actually came from his father’s crop in Kansas City) and boosted by terrific performances, glowing visuals and a wonderful musical score. Steven Yeun and Yeri Han are Jacob and Monica Yi, an immigrant Korean couple who relocate from California to a large plot in the Ozarks with “the best dirt in America”. For Jacob, it’s his dream – the chance to escape the monotony of sexing chickens for a living and to make something of himself. Monica is more sceptical, appalled by the leaky mobile home into which this reckless venture has placed them. A farming novice, her husband must learn the ropes from scratch, aided only by their eccentric neighbour Paul (Will Patton), a Korean-war veteran and religious fanatic who speaks in tongues, performs makeshift exorcisms and spends his Sundays dragging a cross up the local highway. Adding to Monica’s anxieties is the fact that their young son, David (Alan S Kim), has a heart problem and has been told to avoid stress or exertion on pain of death. So Monica’s mother, Soonja (scene-stealing Korean screen veteran Yuh-jung Youn), comes to live with the family, greeted initially with disdain by David, who thinks she “smells like Korea”, but inevitably recognised as the catalyst for healing and redemption. From the moment Jacob turns his nose up at the services of a water diviner who has seen others try and fail to work this land, it’s clear that faith will be a central theme of Chung’s movie. Indeed, with its invocations of the Garden of Eden, biblical storms, prayers for miraculous healing, and even a Forrest Gump-inflected finale, Minari is littered with the kind of trial-by-fire tests and everyday spirituality beloved of Oscar best picture contenders. Yet what makes this more than just another formulaic feelgood film is the grit with which Chung evokes the hardscrabble lives of his characters, balancing the dreamier elements of the drama with a naturalism that keeps it rooted in reality. Early on, David learns what happens to the “discarded” male chicks at the poultry plant where his parents work, and is told the importance of making yourself “useful” – or else. Later, the toll that this American life has taken upon Jacob and Monica’s marriage is heartbreakingly tangible, with Han’s expressive face telegraphing bitter doubts and conflicts long before they are explicitly voiced. When Jacob plaintively reminds Monica that “life was so difficult in Korea”, I thought I heard echoes of Ozu’s Tokyo Story. By contrast, Youn is a ball of barely contained energy, rivalling Tsai Chin’s performance in Sasie Sealy’s Lucky Grandma as the screen’s most lovably unlikely pensioner. Scenes between her and Kim crackle with an irresistible tragicomic spark that perfectly counterpoints the more down-to-earth travails of the central couple. Serving as an intermediary between the mundane and magical-realist elements, Emile Mosseri’s score blends woodwind, piano and guitar with synthesised theremin-style sounds and processed vocals to create a mood that is at once earthy and ethereal. Having elegantly scored The Last Black Man in San Francisco (and saved Miranda July’s Kajillionaire from terminal quirkiness), Mosseri provides the key to Minari’s universal appeal, conjuring a soundtrack that reminded me of Jack Nitzsche’s haunting musical-saw theme from One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest – an understated symphony of sentiment and strangeness, forming a bridge between this world and the next. Minari is available on various VOD platforms	768
Apart from Google Street View employees’ driveways, the LA “underbelly” must be the most filmed place on the planet, from Kiss Me Deadly to Training Day. That capital of spiritual degradation is where this scratchy low-budget drama is bound, as Angeleno wannabe Mandy (Wittie Hughes) meets-cute with a white-boy rapper on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and gets wrecked with him at a pool party. Mandy’s hopes of stardom take a nosedive when she wakes up on a plastic-sheathed mattress in an anonymous low-rise, apparently delivered into human slavery. She has become the “property” of Shadow, a tooth-grilled pimp who appears to have taken James Franco’s “Look at all my shit” soliloquy in Spring Breakers as sound career advice. His sidekick is a mute never seen without a gold Anonymous mask. Director Scott Altman keeps Mandy locked in her room and on strict exploitation-movie rations – she is raped, and cosies up to winsome fellow hooker Lola (Roshema Purfoy) for consolatory spliffs and lesbian cuddles. She alchemises the pain into rap, which finally provides her with a way out. Red Carpet buys hook, line and verse into LA rap romanticism, and at least looks the part: it makes handsome use of the drone technology that has democratised the establishing shot; it delivers at street level too, with a smeary digital aesthetic that is now the mandatory mode for shooting this languorous city. But the story is threadbare – resorting to rape far too often to manufacture incident – to seriously engage beyond lurid cliches. Red Carpet is at its best when it is swept up by its own vibe: Mandy gets lost in breakbeats as she dreams up misery-rhymes to soundtrack a break for freedom that, when it comes, unfolds like a rap video playing in her head. Red Carpet is released on 26 March on digital platforms.	349
This Irish drama documentary feels like a contribution to ongoing efforts to guilt-trip the National Gallery in London into returning to Ireland more than three dozen French impressionist masterpieces bequeathed by the Irish art dealer Hugh Lane. When he wrote his will in 1913, stung by the Dublin authorities’ refusal to grant him planning permission to build a modern art gallery in the city, Lane left the 39 paintings to London. Later, he changed his mind, adding a codicil to his will. His intentions were as clear as day, but the codicil was unwitnessed. So, when he died aged 40 – travelling on the Lusitania, which was sunk by a German U-boat in 1915 – London got the paintings. The film opens with a bit of context, setting the mood in Ireland at the turn of the 1900s. This was the era of Irish cultural revival, WB Yeats and JM Synge, of Irish trade unionism and nationalism. The dramatised bits work pretty well. Tom Vaughan-Lawlor is terrific as Lane, an Irish Protestant, the self-made son of a clergyman. When he stares transfixed at a Titian, there is a blazing chemistry between man and painting. No other relationship can compete. In fact, Lane’s eye was so good that if he so much as looked at a painting before an auction its value shot up. Lane was a snob, but he believed in art for the people. His free-entry gallery in Dublin would have had a bridge over the Liffey, so that ordinary Dubliners would pass the Manets on their way to work. (“You may as well give strawberries to donkeys,” sneered a friend). The National Gallery in London asserts its strict legal rights over the painting, but Citizen Lane puts a convincing case that the moral right belongs to Dublin. (Too late for inclusion in the film, London and Dublin earlier this year reached a truce, agreeing to rotate a number of the paintings.) • Citizen Lane is released on 12 April on digital platforms.	381
In the Guide’s weekly Solved! column, we look into a crucial pop-culture question you’ve been burning to know the answer to – and settle it, once and for all Winning an Oscar is the highlight of a career. It’s peer validation on the largest possible stage. As your name is called and you approach the podium, your heart bursts and your head spins. You look out and see every famous person on Earth, all staring straight at you. Beyond them, cameras are beaming your face into hundreds of millions of homes. Time to gather your thoughts and articulate exactly what this means to you. And then you see it. A huge screen in front of the stage. “30,” it says. Then: “29 … 28 … 27 …” This is the time allotted for your speech, and it is quickly vanishing. Technically you had 45 seconds, but the countdown started the moment your name was announced. You fumble for words, trying to remember the name of everyone who needs to be thanked. But the screen now reads: “PLEASE WRAP UP,” and you aren’t finished. You start speeding through names, and then you hear it. An orchestral swell. You overran and now you’re being played off-stage. Your big moment has ended in ignominy, with the world watching. You know whose fault this is? Greer Garson. When Greer Garson won her best actress Oscar in 1943, it was already 1am. The ceremony had been long and the audience was flagging. Nevertheless, Garson approached the stage and proceeded to deliver the longest speech in Oscars history. Some say it lasted five and a half minutes. Others claim it was closer to seven. Either way, Garson rambled on for so long that Joan Fontaine, the presenter, wandered off and sat down before it had finished. Not long after this, the Academy started to impose time limits on speeches. You can understand why play-off music is necessary. The Oscars is a bloated, overblown ceremony that can very easily spiral out of control. There needs to be a monologue, musical numbers, an In Memoriam section, a ton of commercial breaks and 24 separate awards to be received. If you gave every winner an extra 15 seconds, the ceremony would be six minutes longer. Let everyone be Garson, and you’d have to tack on almost three hours. Given that a typical ceremony already lasts between three and four hours, this would require superhuman levels of endurance. Nevertheless, the Oscars play-off music can be beaten. The easiest way to blast through your allotted time is to win one of the flashier awards. Win best actor, as Adrien Brody did in 2003, and you’ll be allowed to ramble for nearly four minutes. Win best actress, as Halle Berry did in 2002, and you’ll get four and a half. But there are other options. When Parasite won best picture last year, the producers shut the lights off after just two and a half minutes. The cast and crew were only allowed to continue when Tom Hanks initiated a protest chant. And then there’s Paweł Pawlikowski, my favourite ever Oscar winner, who won best foreign language film for Ida in 2015. He spoke until the play-off music began. He continued speaking, and the music grew louder in response. And then he dedicated the award to his dead wife, and the play-off music screeched to an embarrassed halt. If you’re going to beat the system, this is exactly how to do it.	688
Artist and film-maker Jessica Sarah Rinland has authored a brief essay movie on the universal themes of the copy and the original. A copyist reproduces an original work of art, a museum conservator fabricates a damaged object with replacement materials. But the originals are arguably copies of ideas and genres within the artist’s mind, and the biological act of reproduction is an act of copying, from the DNA template. Rinland’s camera observes calmly, almost blankly, as the introduction of howler monkeys into the wild is discussed by zoologists – a habitat where they might breed – and this issue is juxtaposed with restoration work at the V&amp;A, the Natural History Museum and the British Museum in London. An elephant tusk is copied as a plaster cast; confiscated tusks are used to restore a 19th-century ivory box, antiquities are painstakingly brought back to a version of their fundamental selves. It is intricate, meticulous work and Rinland follows it nearly in real time; it is an almost experimental procedure, although a series of titles at the very end make it clear exactly what we have been watching. The film is pregnant with ideas: I found myself thinking of Jean Baudrillard’s writings about the “simulacrum”, about a world with Elvis impersonators but no Elvis. As the ivory box is slowly restored to an approximation of its old self, we have the leisure to consider that this is an activity not very different from making it the first time around: both are from the same prototype, and that the time-lapse between the two has, in some sense, been abolished. • Those That, at a Distance, Resemble Another is available on 6 April on Mubi.	321
Stanley Kubrick to reboot Iron Man? David Lean’s Batman? Fellini’s Wonder Woman? In decades past it was almost unthinkable that “serious” auteur film-makers would stoop to superhero movies; now it’s standard procedure. While deep-set gender disparities in film-making are finally being addressed and a new generation of female auteurs is emerging, is there also a danger the studio franchise machine is gobbling them up before they’ve established themselves? That concern was underlined last week with news that the British film-maker Emerald Fennell’s next gig is writing DC Films’ superhero sorceress tale Zatanna. Fennell has barely begun as a director. Her feature debut, Promising Young Woman, is not due out in the UK until 16 April but has five Oscar nominations, including best director. Alongside Fennell in the best director category, for the first time in history, is another woman: Chloé Zhao, for Nomadland. Zhao’s next movie is Marvel’s Eternals: a $200m extravaganza that seems the opposite of the low-key, socially engaged Nomadland. The superhero sector’s gain could be auteur cinema’s loss: Marvel, DC and co have awoken to the viability of female-led stories, which has meant a demand for women to direct them. Patty “Wonder Woman” Jenkins was an early example, but there are others. Cate Shortland, purveyor of thoughtful, female-centred stories such as Somersault and Berlin Syndrome, has directed Marvel’s Black Widow. Cathy Yan went straight from her promising Chinese-language debut Dead Pigs to DC’s Birds of Prey. Similarly, Nia DaCosta, who made a striking debut with 2018’s Little Woods, is currently on Captain Marvel 2. This phenomenon is not limited to women but it threatens to undo the relatively recent gains female directors have made. Auteur careers are not as easy to maintain as they once were. Many of these women appear to be taking a “one for them, one for me” approach, though some have refused to cross the line. Lucretia Martel turned down an offer to direct Black Widow, and claimed Marvel told her she didn’t need to worry about the action sequences. “They still think action scenes are for male directors,” she said. Cinema’s gender-disparity problems don’t just apply to auteur movies. It is often assumed that all women want to be the next Jane Campion, but there’s nothing wrong with wanting to be the next Michael Bay (or Kathryn Bigelow). Why should they pass up the chance to shape a big, mass-market movie? In fact, Zhao revealed it was she who approached Marvel to direct Eternals, not the other way round. Women’s perspectives could be changing all sectors of cinema, but only if there are enough of them to go round. At the moment, it’s looking dangerously like a zero-sum game.	552
This painstakingly composed black and white documentary about jobbing horses and their employer-companions is perhaps easier to admire than love. On the plus side, the cinematography by Ryan A Randall – a mix of widescreen, immersive landscapes and startlingly stylised shots with inky backgrounds, slow-motion details, or unexpected angles – is consistently beautiful. It’s what truly draws the viewer into this up-close and personal account, directed by Cliff Caines, of three different businesses that use proper working horses, great big massive ones, to do jobs that are in two out of three cases more often done with machines. In the first study, a timberman in Canada uses his two steeds, cheeky Orlagh and stalwart Idaho, to fell and collect trunks, a logging method he insists is better for the forest. The relationship between the logger, who retires at the end of the segment, and his equine co-workers is so emotionally rich that the more workaday, people-centric subsequent sections pale in comparison somewhat. Really, this first bit works on its own as a short, but there’s still much of interest in the second part, about a farming family who use horse teams to plough their fields, and the third, about another family that put their horses through competitions to see which one can haul the most weight – which strictly speaking sounds less like work than sport. By the last half hour, Caines’s use of long, slow takes, and the film’s clippity-clop walking pace grows a little numbing. Also, while the film-makers’ respect for their subjects is manifest, and the people featured all seem like experienced, loving custodians who don’t beat their horses, the film rather takes the humans’ word for it that these animals love to work, having been bred for it over generations. Admittedly, the horses themselves have no means to dispute that assessment, but if they could talk, you rather wonder whether they’d be quite so enthusiastic about lugging farm equipment and huge trees all day long. • Workhorse is released on 9 April on True Story.	394
In honour of Nomadland, the film from director Chloé Zhao that is set to dominate as the connoisseur-choice of this year’s awards season, here is a belated launch of her lovely feature debut from 2015, which never actually had a full release in the UK. I can’t believe it’s taken me this long to see it: some derivative, Malickian touches, yes, but like her other films, it’s a deeply intelligent and sympathetic rendering of real-life situations, using nonprofessionals playing approximations of themselves. The setting is the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota (the site of Wounded Knee creek, where the 1890 massacre of Lakota people took place); John Reddy and Jashaun St John play Johnny and Jashaun, a teen Lakota boy and his kid sister, whose lives are turned upside down when their absentee dad, a bronco rider, dies drunkenly in a fire. Johnny and Jashaun meet all their various half-siblings at the funeral. As Johnny says to his brother Cody (Justin Reddy), now in prison: “It’s as if he’s suddenly back in our lives, now that he’s gone … ain’t that funny?” This clarifies Johnny’s determination to move out of the “rez” and go to Los Angeles, where his aspirational girlfriend Aurelia (Taysha Fuller) is soon going to be a student at UCLA, living in dorms – and the plan is that Johnny somehow finds a job and a place to live, and they will live as a couple that way. Does Johnny believe in his own future? The sheer emotional hurt of Jashaun at being abandoned by her adored elder brother pulses through this film, and she has innocent adventures of her own: her presence gives the movie such warmth. Zhao’s authorial signature was obvious even then, and in just six years she has scaled amazing creative heights. • Songs My Brothers Taught Me is available on 9 April on Mubi.	377
The freewheeling improv style of Jamie Adams (who directed the daffy comedy Black Mountain Poets) hits a wall in his new film about a family Christmas in Wales. There are comedy scenes here that flatline and lightweight fake-feeling emotional moments. Model-actors Suki Waterhouse and Poppy Delevingne are the stars: they look pretty uncomfortable playing sisters visiting their folks for the holidays. Maybe it’s snarky to say, but with their gorgeous knitwear and expensive London accents, it’s hard to buy either of them dunking a Bourbon into a cuppa. Waterhouse is Iris, a flaky-quirky, beret-wearing film composer who has landed a massive gig writing the soundtrack for a big-time Hollywood movie. The trouble is she’s creatively stuck, and anxious about her mum who is dying of an unspecified terminal illness (fading gently propped up on pillows, no fuss). Iris’s sister, Abigail (Delevingne), is back too, and the suggestion is that this is their last family Christmas together. To cure Iris’s writer’s block, her agent flies in legendary American songwriter Eleanor Roberts (Dirty Dancing’s Jennifer Grey), who shows up clanking Jack Daniel’s bottles and jangling silver bangles. The two women connect instantly. Cue earnest lines (“You’ve got to be more than a pretty girl with a guitar”) and boring scenes of them writing songs. Eleanor is also clearly attracted to Iris. Bittersweet Symphony is a film with serious plausibility issues; none of the characters come across like real human beings. But it deserves points for a funnyish subplot that brings home how romcoms so often idealise stalkerish behaviour. Submarine actor Craig Roberts plays Iris’s idiot ex, who devises a series of stunts to prove how much he still loves her – like wrapping himself as a giant Christmas present. It definitely adds to the film. That said, the Onion did the same thing in a one-sentence headline: “Romantic-Comedy Behaviour Gets Real-Life Man Arrested.” • Bittersweet Symphony is released on 12 April on digital platforms.	388
Guilt and the return of the repressed are behind this elegant, disquieting and impressively acted political ghost story from Argentinian film-maker Francisco Márquez. Cecilia (Elisa Carricajo) is a sociology professor and single mother of a little boy, Juan (Ciro Coien Pardo); she is very successful, though on edge about her recent application for an academic promotion. Cecilia gets on well with her maid Nebe (Mecha Martinez) but is made very uncomfortable when Nebe brings round her teenage son Kevin (Eliot Otazo). Kevin seems dour, unsmiling, perhaps with learning difficulties. In the middle of a stormy night, Cecilia is awoken by a terrifying banging at the door, preceded by an eerie dreamlike voice murmuring “Cecilia” in her ear. Peering through the shutters, she can see it is Kevin and is too scared to open up. The next morning, she sees on the news that Kevin’s body has been found in the river, with protesters alleging he was chased down and killed by the police – one of the state’s “common crimes” directed at the poor. Cecilia can’t bring herself to confess to Nebe that she could have helped her son, or tell any of her colleagues. And so she begins to crack under the terrible strain of maintaining this secret along with the day-to-day tasks of her sophisticated and successful intellectual life, believing Kevin has come back to haunt her. As well as a comment on Argentina’s present, A Common Crime is about its past: Kevin has been “disappeared”, like dissidents under the junta. And when Cecilia is late for work one day it makes her head of department very nervous – he is old enough to remember that when certain academics were “late”, they never showed up at all. There are points of comparison here with other films – the Dardennes’ The Unknown Girl, for example, or Lucrecia Martel’s The Headless Woman – and the junta killings arguably play the same role here as France’s “nuit noire”, the notorious 1961 police slaughter of Algerian protesters, in Michael Haneke’s Hidden. But Márquez brings his own distinctive touch and Carricajo is excellent; she shows us how, with so much at stake and with a lifetime’s adult experience at putting on a good show and presenting as perfectly fine, a prosperous middle-class professional can swallow a guilty secret and carry on. But the tiny poison symptoms inevitably begin to surface. A smart piece of work. • A Common Crime is released on 9 April on digital platforms.	489
Like you, I was convinced that the versus movie genre died five years ago. What began as a silly, self-aware method of getting bums on seats had hardened into the unforgivable grimdark pomposity of Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice. Any rational human being would see a film like BvS as a larky bit of inconsequential fun. And yet there it was; three hours of ponderous emo claptrap where the cinematic equivalent of two toys knocking together was treated like nothing less than an actual biblical text. Why bother making another versus movie after the agony of Marthagate? Well, now that Godzilla vs Kong is out, it looks like we’re back on. Because Godzilla v Kong is everything anyone wants from a film like this. Two big dumb animals slugging each other in new and different ways for barely any reason at all, and the whole thing is wrapped up in less than two hours. Better yet, the film understands how stupid it is. These might qualify as spoilers, so skip this paragraph if you haven’t seen it yet, but the film begins with King Kong having a shower. There’s a bit in the middle where Godzilla literally blasts a hole all the way to the centre of the Earth just on the off-chance that some rubble might smack King Kong on the head in the process. There’s a skyscraper-tall robot kung-fu lizard who, while ostensibly the baddie, you sort of end up rooting for. There are several scenes where humans run from peril with such impressive ham-fistedness that you will genuinely come to believe that the original intention was to soundtrack them all with Yakety Sax. The whole thing is dumber than a box of farts, but the film never tries not to lean away from it. It’s beautiful. And now, quite frankly, all I want to do is watch versus movies. Where once there was a wasteland, now I see nothing but promise. The Monsterverse, clearly, needs to go on forever. If it can maintain this tone, rather than default to the hollow awe of the much worse Godzilla: King of the Monsters, then it deserves to run and run. Let’s bring back Gigan (essentially a giant knife-armed ninja), or King Caesar (a sort of huge gormless dog who can only be woken up if a princess sings a full three-minute song at him) and make them fight Godzilla and Kong. Heck, let’s chuck the Cloverfield monster back into the mix, and one or two of whatever those things from Pacific Rim were as well. The more the merrier. The Monsterverse is basically the WWE at this point, so we may as well make it a Royal Rumble. Then, I suggest going back and fixing the errors of the past. 1966’s Billy the Kid vs Dracula, for example, featured almost no scenes of Billy the Kid fighting Dracula. Let’s change that. Let’s make a new film where, right from frame one, Billy the Kid and Dracula just Tom and Jerry the knickers out of each other like the clappers. Imagine the last third of Home Alone, but starring a cowboy and a vampire. Brilliant, right? Or let’s have another shot at Alien vs Predator, but this time there’s just one Predator and one Alien, and they’re both 300 metres tall, and nobody ever adequately explains what’s going on. You’d watch that. You’re angry that you can’t already watch that. And then the fun can really start; scouring other franchises for suitable versus movie candidates. God knows there are a lot of them. You could revive the Terminator series by making a film where an old T-800 has a boxing match with Rocky Balboa. Or a film where James Bond fights The Rock and Jason Statham from Hobbs and Shaw. Or, and I’m just spitballing here, Harry Potter vs Jurassic Park. It’s similarly bewildering that Disney – which produced seven of the top 10 films of 2019 – hasn’t already got in on this. Imagine Snow White vs Cinderella. Imagine Aladdin vs Wreck-It Ralph. Imagine, and I mean this, Frozen versus The Lion King. Imagine Elsa from Frozen fighting an actual lion for two hours, and being mauled whenever she started to sing. And then, with the formula for this sort of thing definitely cracked, let’s have another shot at Batman vs Superman. Make it lighter and less rain-soaked. Make Batman and Superman clatter each other with saucepans and cricket bats, and edit in a load of SPROING sound effects whenever they do. Make Batman hit Superman with an antique vase at one point, and have the vase’s owner stand next to them while it happens, and make his monocle pop out at the moment of impact. Make it exactly 87 minutes long, including credits. This is the film we should have got in 2016. And, thanks to the majesty of Godzilla vs Kong, it’s the movie we can have again.	970
There’s a tantalising R-rated premise at the centre of the PG-13-rated sci-fi thriller Voyagers. In the future, the Earth is slowly becoming uninhabitable (something that’s depressingly less fiction and more science) and so a crew is assembled, by a muted Colin Farrell, to travel to another planet to check for viability, a familiar set-up given a novel spin. Because of the length of the journey – a rather off-putting 86 years – participants will be created rather than procured, spliced together from the finest DNA and grown in a lab, their sole purpose to begin the trip, procreate and let their children and then their children lead the way. But deep into the quest, a shocking discovery is made: the crew is being drugged. A blue liquid they’re told to take daily (explained away as some sort of enzyme mixture) is revealed to be something far more nefarious: a cocktail of chemicals aimed at subduing their impulses. By removing the ability to feel or desire extremities (fear, excitement, horniness) they are then made more docile and in turn more effective at achieving their mission. When two members decide to stop taking it, disaster strikes. The possibilities teased by writer-director Neil Burger (who dealt with a loosely alternate version of this concept in 2011’s thrill pill drama Limitless) are intriguing. How would submissive, isolated youths growing up without any influence from the outside world deal with a sudden cracked upon universe of sexual desire and rampant emotions? With training designed specifically to cover the practical side of their trip, how would they then understand concepts of consent and responsibility? What dangers would arise? But such thorniness is soon blunted in the ho hum execution, a Lord of the Flies-lite drama that plays out more like a YA adaptation of a book fans would claim is far better. The trippy neon trailer would have you believe that we’re entering Gaspar Noé-adjacent territory, all psychedelic head fuckery and playful perversity, but Burger is too restrained, too polite to take us anywhere quite so extreme. The heightened emotions felt by the crew are never really felt by us the audience, there’s a headiness that’s missing and in the brief moments when Burger does try to convey the characters’ giddy intensity, he relies on a failed visual motif, a dated montage of discordant images, closer to a musty 90s Windows screensaver than something from a film released in 2021. The script never really grapples with the dark implications of his conceit, how without regulation and law, the youths would embrace their wilder side in more horrifying ways, choosing instead to tiptoe rather than forcefully tread, a psychosexual cautionary tale rendered impotent. Sex is lightly suggested (again in opposition to what the trailers promise) while any form of sexual fluidity is nowhere to be seen, Burger’s script perhaps, hopefully unintentionally implying that queerness is less nature and more nurture. But such big thinking would suggest that much thinking has actually gone into Voyagers, a generous assertion, given how anything remotely challenging is quickly chucked into deep space and replaced by rote formula. The crew inevitably divides into warring factions battling for supremacy but such little care is taken with the characters that we struggle to care who wins out. Tye Sheridan, Fionn Whitehead and Lily Rose-Depp are the only three who get the lightest of look-ins but not one of them is able to do much with the scraps they’ve been given, leaving the ramped-up conflict ineffective as the film crashes toward a predictable conclusion. The production design is sleek but anonymous and aside from the specifics of the set-up, there are no particularly inventive elements to Burger’s vision of the future, nothing to distract us from the rather dull human drama. It’s all just too sanitised and safe, a journey that stumbles as it takes us from the unknown to the familiar, a film that plods when it should stride. How did a bracing idea about rebellion, sexual awakening and lawlessness turn out so boring? Voyagers is out in cinemas in the US on 9 April, and in the UK on 8 October on Sky Cinema and NOW.	788
Boldly declaring itself a “homosexual film”, Sequin in a Blue Room is neither coy nor moralistic about online gay hookup culture. The apps have a toxic side, yes, but the film also acutely understands the heady, tactile pleasure of casual sex. Despite the thriller aesthetics, Sequin in a Blue Room is at its heart a coming-of-age tale in a digital world filled with instant sexual gratifications and perilous risks. The film is, in one word, hot; rippling with an electrifying sexual energy. The anonymity is key. Even the 16-year-old protagonist, played by Conor Leach, has no name. He is known only as Sequin, a display name on a hookup app where he procures no-strings sex from much older men. With cut-glass cheekbones, Sequin is striking and arrogantly cocksure of the power attached to such assets. The silvery, sequin-encrusted crop-top reserved for his trysts only enhances the detached precocity. Nevertheless, Sequin’s walls come tumbling down when he finds himself at an anonymous sex party called the Blue Room. The scene pulsates with carnal desires and a hint of danger. Bathed in a dazzling blue light, indiscernible bodies writhe to hypnotic electronic music, while Sequin enjoys an intense encounter with another man. As lust ignites what feels like love, Sequin searches for his unidentified hookup, only to get entangled in a web of lies, manipulation and predation. That Sequin in a Blue Room was director Samuel van Grinsven’s graduate project is astonishing considering the film’s inspired visual panache, and the eroticism of the explicit depictions of casual sex. Leach’s performance in his first film acting credit is equally impressive; the way in which Sequin’s swagger gradually drains from his face to expose an inner vulnerability is incredibly moving. With such an impressive debut, Van Grinsven is surely one to watch. • Sequin in a Blue Room is released on 9 April on digital platforms.	363
Shot in and around London’s Hampstead and Belsize Park areas, this quirky anti-romantic comedy revolves around thirtysomething nutritionist Rob (likably schlubby Al Weaver), an ordinary bloke who can’t quite bring himself to commit, and his longsuffering long-term girlfriend Marta (Cristina Catalina). Keenly aware of how little time is left on her biological clock and desperate to have a baby, she stands by virtually tapping her foot while she waits for him to propose, or at least agree to get her knocked up. Rob, meanwhile, surveys the wildly contradictory advice he gets from his eclectic assortment of male friends. Some, particularly the ones already paired up and reproducing, counsel Rob to settle for Marta and stop looking for the perfect woman because no one will be that girl. Rob secretly wants to be more of a player like his friend Chris (Morgan Watkins), a smoothie who looks like a better version of Rob – but who is suffering from erectile dysfunction problems and has a growing interest in seeing escorts because it’s “more honest”. It would be so easy for this film to end up leaving a bitter taste in the mouth, but writer-director Col Spector is trying to work up something that is essentially more honest than the usual romcom. The gags don’t always land, and some of the line deliveries plod painfully on, but there are moments that nail the strange comedy of sexual manners that must be navigated these days; is it appropriate, for example, to pull your date out of a threesome if they’re clearly enjoying themselves and want to stay? The depressed clarinet soundtrack gets a bit irritating after a while, but on the whole it’s not at all bad, and John Henshaw’s cameo as one of Rob’s disgruntled patients is a particular treat. • I’m Not in Love is released on 12 April on digital platforms.	364
There’s an serious outbreak of top hats and mutton chops in this amiable adaptation of Jules Verne’s From the Earth to the Moon, originally released in 1967, when the real world was gearing up for the Apollo moonshot a couple of years later. Produced by the prolific Harry Towers, it adopted the rambling wacky-races format that had proved enduringly popular throughout the 1950s and 60s; most recently with the 1965 hit Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines, which it shamelessly capitalised on with its US title (Those Fantastic Flying Fools) as well as redeplying the ubiquitous Terry-Thomas, who played yet another moustache-twirling cad. Rocket to the Moon is watchable in a bored-Sunday-afternoon sort of way: it’s about whether an international consortium, led by Burl Ives (as Phineas T Barnum) and Dennis Price, can successfully build a giant cannon into the side of a mountain that can fire a human missile up to the moon, using a radical new form of gunpowder. Terry-Thomas is the chief meanie, with inventor brother-in-law Lionel Jeffries; Troy Donahue plays a dashing balloonist who lands in the middle of it all. Conceived on a relatively large scale for a British film of the period, it’s hampered somewhat by the fact there is no actual race to speak of, as well as the necessity of expanding scenes for some of the actors to placate international financing. Some of the material, it’s safe to say, has not dated well: particularly the jokes at the expense of Tom Thumb (Jimmy Clitheroe), and the dumb-ditz scenes given to Israeli actor Daliah Lavi. There’s a certain steampunk energy on show but it’s otherwise pretty good-natured, offering the mostly undemanding spectacle of people falling off penny-farthing bicycles or crashing into haystacks. You couldn’t call any of this actually funny, but it’s pleasant enough. • Jules Verne’s Rocket to the Moon is released on 12 April on digital platforms, Blu-ray and DVD.	376
In Don McCullin’s 1970s photographs of grinding poverty in the East End, Whitechapel looks like it might have in Dickens’s lifetime. And it’s grim deprivation that student nurse Val (Rose Williams) walks into on her first day on the wards of an east London hospital in this feminist horror; her first patient is a little girl with rickets and stunted growth. Written and directed by Corinna Faith, this film is a real screw-tightener, ingeniously set during the miners’ strike in January 1974. What could be scarier than the lights going out in a Victorian hospital in the dead of night? When Val arrives most of the patients are being transferred to another hospital for the night because of a scheduled power cut. Val is on the “dark shift” – staying to cover two wards kept going by a generator. She is too embarrassed to admit that she’s scared of the dark, triggered by childhood abuse in a care home. Pretty soon Val is clinging to the corridor walls, groping her way in the dark – and that’s even before things go bang in the night. There are cracking lines in the script; unexpectedly, some of them very funny. In the staff room, an Irish nurse is reading Stephen King’s Carrie (not actually published until three months later, in April). “It’s about a girl who’s had enough and burns it all down,” jokes the nurse. And what follows is like Carry on Carrie – or maybe more Carry on Exorcist. Val becomes possessed by a demonic power. Or is she experiencing a psychotic episode? Either way, the bodies are piling up as a result of masculinity (in the hospital and elsewhere) that’s so toxic it’s literally contaminating everything. After a bit of a damp start, the scares are merciless. Demonically possessed characters convulsing are ten a penny in horror movies, but Val’s limbs twist like she’s a doll being yanked by a spiteful toddler. It’s unbearable to see in places, especially since Val has already suffered so much. Now some kind of malevolent force is taking over her body, another violation. Empowerment for female victims comes late in the day too, making this a raw and painful watch. • The Power is released on 8 April on Shudder.	452
People used to say that The Lord of the Rings was unfilmable. The scale of Tolkien’s books, the sprawl of them, their unyielding density, made it almost impossible to compress them into a more simplistic form for the screen. Of course, Peter Jackson proved this theory wrong in 2001. But now it turns out that Leningrad Television proved it wrong a full decade earlier. This weekend without warning, a Russian television channel uploaded Khraniteli, a 1991 adaptation of The Fellowship of the Ring, to its YouTube channel. Despite not speaking Russian, I have now watched all two hours of Khraniteli, and it isn’t an exaggeration to say that it’s now my favourite Lord of the Rings story made in any medium ever. To be clear, I did not understand a single thing that happened over the two-hour running time. Even though I have read the book and seen the film, Khraniteli unfolds in such ramshackle fashion that I was lost from the very first scene. That scene, if you’re wondering, is the one where some hobbits stand around in what appears to be a decommissioned children’s television studio and have what can only be described as an LSD freak-out. A very specific LSD freak-out too, I might add. It’s the sort of LSD freak-out you saw on after-school public information films in the 1980s, a gauzy-framed affair where characters dance on the spot while cycling through the full spectrum of human emotions at top speed to the sound of Soviet folk-prog. It is enormously disconcerting to watch. It is, I suspect, what Helen Hunt saw in her mind that time she took crystal meth and flung herself out of a window. The overwhelming shonkiness is what jumps out at you initially. Khraniteli was clearly made on no budget whatsoever. The costumes are poor, the special effects largely consist of people just wobbling around, and the One Ring (which on occasion appears to be a slice of toilet roll with some gold foil wrapped around it) makes a sound like you’ve just lost a life on a badly received Atari 2600 game whenever anyone puts it on. There is a narrator, too – presumably JRR Tolkien himself – who starts narrating in a traditional sense, only to abandon the role in favour of just puffing on a pipe in a series of unexplained, but wordlessly disapproving, cutaway shots. And then there’s Gollum who, and there’s really no other way to describe this, is a man with some cabbage on his head. And yet, once you manage to tune in to Khraniteli’s weird frequency, it quickly becomes very charming and quite beautiful. There are very limited exterior shots here, but they all make full use of the brutal Russian winter. The sequences featuring the Ringwraiths are astonishing, gorgeous little dusk-shot beauties that are so well realised that you wished the production had the money to film more of the story like this. But in the end, the limitations are exactly what you’ll come to enjoy about Khraniteli. The Peter Jackson Lord of the Rings films may deliver more spectacle, but there’s a sense of atmosphere here that he was never able to match. In the best way, this is a deeply grubby adaptation. Every overlong and interchangeable banquet scene. Every dimly lit set. Every badly applied eyebrow. Every audible background rustle or VHS camera wobble. Every actor who, regardless of age or character, seems to be about 55 years old. It all builds and builds into something that, however intentionally, ends up being pretty spooky to watch. You can almost smell it. I mean that as a positive. Nobody had to make Khraniteli. They didn’t have the money or the means or the technology to do The Lord of the Rings justice. And yet, simply by force of spirit alone, it’s unforgettable. I’m never going to watch it again, because I’m not an animal, but I’m glad I watched it once.	771
In any other year, Godzilla vs. Kong could be filed as just another bloated, unoriginal franchise flick. But this hasn’t been any other year. It’s a year that has seen trips to the movies stolen away by a global pandemic, as all blockbuster releases have either been postponed or shifted to a streaming-only release. This being the case, Godzilla vs. Kong has been welcomed as a thunderous return for the big-screen experience. And the numbers show it. The fourth film in Legendary’s MonsterVerse raked in more than £206m ($285m) at the worldwide box office during its opening days, the highest debut of any American film in the pandemic era. There is a strong chance that it could outperform MonsterVerse’s Godzilla: King of the Monsters, which was a financial disappointment in the pre-pandemic era in 2019, grossing $383m worldwide during one of Hollywood’s most lucrative years. The joy with which Godzilla has been hailed contrasts with the muted response to the highest-performing Hollywood film during the pandemic: Christopher Nolan’s Tenet. After a seemingly endless number of delays to its release, Tenet was hyped by both the industry and the press as the film that would “save cinema”. For good reason: it was a new big-screen outing for a director who pushes the technological limits of film-making, bedazzling audiences with advancements in visuals, sound and cinematography. Everything Nolan touches turns to gold, it seems. Except, not this time. When Tenet was released in August last year, it failed to set cinemas alight. Perhaps it was because audiences continued to doubt whether returning to the big screen was worth risking exposure to the virus. Or possibly because Tenet is a two-and-a-half hour flex with a bewildering storyline draped in technical razzle dazzle. Most likely, it was a mixture of both.Its global total didn’t even reach that of Nolan’s previous film, the “difficult” second world war picture Dunkirk. So much for saving cinema. Godzilla vs. Kong has instead romped ahead not as the hero we deserve, but the hero we need. It has chalked up $200m worldwide in half the time that it took Tenet, enjoying a wider release in places where the virus is under control such as China and New Zealand. Godzilla vs. Kong has also been helped by a slightly wider release in the US compared with Tenet, which opened to tighter restrictions in most states and wasn’t able to open at all in California or New York. The hype surrounding Godzilla vs. Kong is different too. With ever-changing release dates, and Nolan’s quixotic insistence on releasing the film in cinemas whatever the cost, the buildup to Tenet was characterised by stubbornness and frustration. By contrast, when the trailer for Godzilla vs. Kong dropped in January and drew in tens of millions of views, it became rapidly apparent that a giant ape fighting a colossal lizard is exactly what the doctor ordered. Does it bravely push artistic and technical boundaries? No. Does it matter? Not really. Unlike Tenet, the belief that a great ape and a dinosaur going at it for 15 rounds might save cinema only started to gain traction after the film’s release. Rather than forcing something complicated and messy on exhausted cinephiles and punters, Godzilla vs. Kong is a simplistic slice of escapist heaven. A film that might otherwise have been forgotten has romped effortlessly to the rescue where Tenet tried too hard to be the hero. Godzilla vs. Kong speaks volumes about what it will take to keep the movies alive. Something that makes you forget about the outside world, rather than have you longing to go back to it. Cinema is in too perilous a place right now to be stuck up on a high horse. If it takes brainless kaiju carnage to reignite love for the big screen, then we are not really in a position to complain.	737
The actor Regé-Jean Page has addressed reports he was turned down for a leading role in the superhero TV series Krypton because of his skin colour. “Multiple sources” cited by the Hollywood Reporter earlier this week suggested the producers of Krypton – an origins series focused on Superman’s grandfather – were “passionate about doing some nontraditional casting” when recruiting for the show, which ran for two seasons starting in 2018. This reportedly led to Page landing an audition, until his possible appointment was vetoed by Geoff Johns, the co-founder of DC Films, who said Superman “could not have a black grandfather”. Tweeting on Wednesday evening, Page wrote: “Hearing about these conversations hurts no less now than it did back then. The clarifications almost hurt more tbh. Still just doing my thing. Still we do the work. We still fly.” In a statement to E! News, a representative for Johns said his client felt fans would expect Superman’s grandfather, , “to look like a young Henry Cavill”, referring to the actor who most recently played Superman on the big screen. They continued: “Geoff never said Superman can’t have a black ancestor or be black – there have been diverse versions of Superman throughout the comics for decades so he does and can be diverse. “However, the expectation for Krypton was that it would initially be perceived as a possible prequel to Man of Steel by the fans and the lead was expected to invoke a young Henry Cavill.” Page’s decision to leave the hit Netflix show Bridgerton after one series has surprised many and led to numerous rumours about possible next roles for the actor, who recently hosted Saturday Night Live. He is the current favourite to replace Daniel Craig as James Bond, following the release of No Time to Die in September. Some reports have also attached him to the Black Panther series. Although the title role is not thought to be up for grabs, following the death of star Chadwick Boseman last August, director Ryan Coogler and Marvel producers are said to be eager to expand the roster of characters whose stories would be explored in future films.	409
This gleefully blood-splattered Korean gangster film with an unlikely romantic subplot looks for most of its running time like the sort of cult-friendly genre discovery one could watch and then crow over before an inevitable Hollywood remake comes out. That said, the ending is so relentlessly bleak that a faithful remake would be unlikely – while an unfaithful one with a happier conclusion would be absurd given the ruthless logic of writer-director Park Hoon-jung’s plotting. The initiating setup is that after something really bad happens, moody pretty-boy gangster Tae-Gu (Eom Tae-goo) must hide out on a resort island in off-season before he is ultimately resettled in Vladivostok, Russia. En route he stays with a grumpy arms dealer, a former gangster himself, and that man’s troubled, taciturn niece Jae-Yeon (Jeon Yeo-been). But it soon transpires that there’s hidden depths in both Jae-Yeon and Tae-Gu, who after the de rigueur initial verbal sparring become unlikely friends – and maybe potential soul mates, especially when they end up bonding over their shared affection for mulhoe, a spicy raw fish soup which plays a significant role in the story. In fact, there are a lot of meals throughout, discussions of who is hungry and a key plot-furthering sit-down among gangsters in a restaurant that involves one of those huge rotating trivets typical of Korean restaurants so that people can share dishes more easily. This is not a film to watch on an empty stomach, both because the food looks great and those of a delicate disposition might, like one of the gangsters, feel a little nauseous after the gory bits. Leisurely pacing rather draws it all out a bit, but there’s real inventiveness to the way Park wrong-foots the viewer and handles the operatic displays of gunfire and death – and the leads are rather charming. • Night in Paradise is released on 9 April on Netflix.	349
There’s a blue-chip cast for this tasty 1961 Brit noir, a brash and brassy mob drama in the bright lights of London’s Soho and the West End – the world of Dassin’s Night and the City. Alfred Marks plays Harry Foulcher, a creepy club owner whose supposedly legitimate business is a front for a protection racket, putting the arm on smalltime pubs and dives for a tenner a week. His crooked accountant Waldo Zhernikov, played with gorgeous insinuation by Herbert Lom, persuades Harry to sit down with all the other cauliflower-eared villains to form a profitable London-wide syndicate, to the disgust of the hard-nosed honest copper Detective Inspector Sayers, robustly played by John Gregson. These gangsters need a cool tough guy to collect the larger sums coming in, so they recruit a cat burglar called Paddy Damion, an ordinary decent criminal who needs the money … played by pre-007 Sean Connery. It’s richly enjoyable stuff and the early-60s London locations are a treat. As so often with this kind of movie, there’s fascination in the quaint club scenes: the racy, naughty, semi-unclothed floor shows in Soho establishments that are frequented by posh gentlemen who like to slum it, the sort of place where someone like Stephen Ward or John Profumo were to be found in Michael Caton-Jones’s Scandal (1989). Waldo has a young woman in whom he takes an almost Ward-like platonic interest: a Russian singer called Anya (Yvonne Romain) who warbles away at the grand piano that Waldo preposterously has in a room adjoining his office. Anya is to fall in love, naturally, with Connery. It’s all good stuff with some ripe cameos to be savoured by Talking Pictures TV fans. The Frightened City also happens to be the film debut of Stephen Lewis, then credited as Stephen Cato, playing a lanky young Brummie thug – later to be seen playing Blakey in TV’s On the Buses. • The Frightened City is available on 12 April on Blu-ray, DVD and digital platforms.	384
It’s possible to imagine a sci-fi nightmare about someone waking up in a world where every film they watch turns out to be a different remake of Groundhog Day – until that person fixes some awful sadness or wrongness or selfishness in their life. Only then can they sit down to a film and realise with a smile of inexpressible relief that it isn’t a bittersweet comedy about being trapped in a time-loop. Credits. It’s a credit to LA musician-turned-screenwriter Andy Siara that he has managed to make this time-loop film so ingenious, so good-natured and so funny, hurdling the inevitable deja-vu objections. We awaken in a luxury hotel resort at which Nyles, played by Andy Samberg, is a wedding guest, along with girlfriend Misty (Meredith Hagner) who is a maid-of-honour, and with whom Nyles has a sexual problem all too horribly indicative of his current cosmic situation. At the ceremony, Nyles is bleary, drunk and cheerfully disengaged, but at the reception party he finds a connection with the bride’s lonely, unhappy sister Sarah (Cristin Milioti, who played Teresa, the first wife of Jordan Belfort in The Wolf of Wall Street). They ditch the party to be alone together, but come into traumatic contact with another important person in Nyles’s life, a murderously angry old guy called Mike (JK Simmons), and Sarah is to realise the awful fix Nyles has got her into. Samberg is probably the only actor who could have sold this film’s premise to us so effortlessly and Peter Pannishly. As a performer, Samberg is a living cartoon of casual comic precision. He is 42 years old, but looks no older than he did when I first saw him in the 2007 comedy Hot Rod, plausibly playing a kid far younger than his then late twentysomething self. He maybe has a portrait of Paul Rudd in his attic (or it could be the other way around). Palm Springs was a smash at this year’s Sundance film festival, and people said it was because lockdown has made time-loops fashionable … again. But they are a perennially potent film subject. As for Palm Springs, it delivers some much-needed laughs. I’d like to watch it again. • Palm Springs is released on 9 April on Amazon Prime Video.	438
The existential issue of disability is worried at in this vehemently acted addiction-recovery drama about a heavy-metal drummer who suddenly experiences hearing loss. Clearly, very personal experiences are here being transformed into fiction. Director and co-writer Darius Marder has avowedly based his movie in part on his hearing-impaired grandmother, and partly on an abandoned docu-drama project he was developing 10 years ago with director Derek Cianfrance called Metalhead, in which the real-life mega-decibel metal duo Jucifer were going to play a version of themselves in which the drummer is imagined to be (unsurprisingly) going deaf. Yet in this film, hearing loss isn’t the only issue at stake. Riz Ahmed gives a typically fierce and focused performance as Ruben, drummer with an avant-metal band called Blackgammon; his partner Lou (Olivia Cooke) is guitarist and singer. They tour around the United States in an RV playing to loyal metalhead fanbases, happy enough until Ruben realises he can’t hear anything – a terrifying aural fog on the soundtrack. The catastrophe is made even worse because he is a recovering heroin addict with serious relationship issues. Ruben’s sponsor suggests he applies to a radical therapeutic community run by a greying Vietnam veteran called Joe, in which role Paul Raci gives a quietly weighted and serious performance. Joe’s belief is that hearing-impaired people need to “learn how to be deaf”: to learn how to accept their condition as a valid alternative existence, and to find the stillness inside themselves which is the vital precondition for this learning process. But angry, bewildered Ruben is still planning to somehow get the money together for a costly, risky surgery that would restore some of his hearing – though that might mean selling his RV and his musical equipment, sabotaging the musical career that was supposedly the whole point. Sound of Metal is a painful, thoughtful, sombre film that telescopes a long story into just a few months. Ruben pretty much immediately finds a doctor to give him the hearing tests, pretty much immediately finds a place in Joe’s community, pretty much immediately progresses from mutinous incomprehension to the beginnings of that surrendered wisdom that makes him an invaluable student-teacher for hearing-impaired kids. There’s a nice initial scene in which Ruben is invited to write his name on the board, and he truculently scrawls it in huge letters, making all the kids flinch. It’s the equivalent of yelling. At first, it looks as if Sound of Metal is going to be all about the clash between Ruben and Joe and their differences of opinion. It’s actually not a million miles away from the difference in Children of a Lesser God (1979), between William Hurt’s idealistic teacher who believes in vocalisation and Marlee Matlin’s rebellious former student who opposes it in favour of sign language as something with a cultural authenticity of its own, though here the teacher/pupil attitude is reversed. But the narrative progresses beyond this, into something interestingly unfinished and unclosed, leading us to Lou’s own painful story, and her relationship with her father Richard (an intriguing if opaque cameo from Mathieu Amalric). But how about Ruben’s drug problem? Is he going to relapse, or what? Or is the film trying to suggest that the world of heavy metal, so far from being an admirable artistic vocation or creative calling, is just itself a type of addiction – one, moreover, with an obvious disability risk? I’m not sure. This film could just as easily have been about a drummer going deaf who had no drug problem. Sound of Metal tries to do something else, something more complex, but it looks as if disability and addiction are uneasily muddled together, and the film never quite unravels the strands. But Ahmed’s performance clarifies the drama and delivers the meaning of Ruben’s final epiphany. He gives the film energy and point. • Sound of Metal is released on 12 April on Amazon Prime Video and on 17 May in cinemas.	758
Phoebe Waller-Bridge is set to join Harrison Ford in the fifth Indiana Jones movie. The Emmy-winning star and creator of Fleabag will appear in as-yet-unconfirmed role in the latest instalment of the hit adventure franchise. Steven Spielberg, who had directed the previous chapters, will hand over the reins to James Mangold, whose recent credits include Logan and Ford v Ferrari. The director previously stated that he wanted to “pass along Indy’s whip to a new generation to bring their perspective to the story”. Spielberg will remain a producer along with Kathleen Kennedy, Frank Marshall and Simon Emanuel. “I’m thrilled to be starting a new adventure, collaborating with a dream team of all-time great film-makers,” Mangold said in a statement. “Steven, Harrison, Kathy, Frank, and John are all artistic heroes of mine. When you add Phoebe, a dazzling actor, brilliant creative voice and the chemistry she will undoubtedly bring to our set, I can’t help but feel as lucky as Indiana Jones himself.” The film follows 2008’s Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull which received mixed reviews but made over $790m worldwide. It’s set to be the 78-year-old Ford’s final film as the adventurer. “We’ve seen the character develop and grow over a period of time and it’s perfectly appropriate and OK for him to come back again with a great movie around him,” Ford said back in 2013. Waller-Bridge scored acclaim and awards for her two-season comedy drama Fleabag and has franchise experience having starred in Solo: A Star Wars Story and working on the script for the upcoming 007 thriller No Time to Die. The multi-hyphenate was also recently attached to a Mr and Mrs Smith reboot series alongside Donald Glover. The as-yet-untitled Indiana Jones sequel is set to arrive in cinemas in July 2022.	352
Whatever the results, the 74th British Academy Film Awards, which take place this weekend, will be almost unrecognisable from last year’s ceremony. This is not just thanks to the pandemic. Over the past 14 months, the prizes have undergone a transformation of unprecedented scope and rapidity. The most evident and widely applauded change is the breadth and diversity of nominees, with Rocks – Sarah Gavron’s coming-of-age drama about a group of black British schoolgirls – leading the pack, alongside Chloé Zhao’s elegiac Nomadland. Both have seven nominations. While no people of colour featured in Bafta’s acting shortlists last year, this year there are 16 among the 24 nominees, with the late Chadwick Boseman favourite to win the leading actor award for his role in Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom. Four of this year’s directing nominees are female, including Zhao, but not including Emerald Fennell, the British director who is Oscar-nominated for her debut feature, Promising Young Woman. Three of the six directors up for the award are people of colour. Such shortlists are vindication of the 120 changes brought in by the organisation in the wake of last year’s #BaftasSoWhite backlash. These include an overhaul of membership, compulsory checks on voters having viewed movies and the insistence that juries decide on final shortlists (after longlists are compiled by individual chapters). These changes signal not just the evolution of a body that had long been associated with the championing of white, period, “prestige” British fare ripe for international consumption, but also a shift in the emphasis of the awards’ remit. For the past 20 years, the Baftas have taken place a fortnight before the Oscars; a scheduling decision from which they have derived considerable status. As voting for the Academy Awards enters its final furlong, the Baftas are the last chance for nominees to impress those yet to cast their ballots. As well as a well-dressed international platform, the Baftas function as a relatively reliable Oscars bellwether. A strong performance in London usually translates to a sweep of silverware in Hollywood 14 days later. Yet this year, Bafta’s decision to amplify minority voices means it looks like a radical outlier rather than a stepping stone, its shortlist bearing little resemblance to any of the other major film awards. Castigated in 2020 for what many felt to be a troublingly old-fashioned list, it now feels positively futuristic – and exposes the lack of ambition elsewhere. The changes do not stop with the films in competition. This year’s ceremony has been split into two, in theory to ensure the “craft” awards are not dashed through – or worse still, edited out of the main broadcast entirely. This means that prizes for the likes of production design, costumes, and makeup and hair will be handed out in an hour-long ceremony broadcast on BBC Two on Saturday night. The 17 remaining awards will be given out from 7-9pm the following night on BBC One: two hours earlier than usual (a decision rumoured to revolve around Line of Duty earmarking the coveted 9pm spot). This earlier timeframe will make for a more sanitised ceremony than usual, suitable – in theory – for family viewing. Regular host Graham Norton, whose patter might have been leant towards the risque, is sitting out proceedings in favour of co-hosts Dermot O’Leary and Edith Bowman, usually seen wrangling celebrities on the red carpet. There will be no red carpet outside the Royal Albert Hall this year, although some presenters will be turning up in person to record their segments in front of an empty auditorium. These include Hugh Grant, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Tom Hiddleston, Priyanka Chopra Jonas, James McAvoy and David Oyelowo. Meanwhile, Rose Byrne, Andra Day, Anna Kendrick and Renée Zellweger will pitch in with presenting duties from a studio in Los Angeles. All nominees will appear virtually. This setup recalls the Golden Globes six weeks ago, when the broadcast was beset by technical glitches. Yet the Bafta team have – once again – introduced a two-and-a-half-hour timelag between the actual ceremony and its broadcast, which should allow for the smoothing over of Zoom difficulties, as well as the expunging of expletives. Traditionally, this gap has led to an awkward situation in which the results are reported just as the show begins its broadcast; this year Bafta will embargo the results until they are revealed on TV in a bid to heighten the tension for viewers. The Duke of Cambridge, who is the president of Bafta, will feature on both nights: his speech on Sunday will celebrate the resilience of the film industry over the past year. It is not known if this was recorded before the death of his grandfather, Prince Philip.	892

There is good news if you are a fan of the first Ghostbusters movie: the original crew of Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Ernie Hudson will be back, along with Sigourney Weaver and even Annie Potts (as secretary Janine Melnitz), in Jason Reitman’s Ghostbusters: Afterlife. But there is bad news for those hoping that the forthcoming sequel, a direct followup to the 1980s movies, will show how much Paul Feig’s underrated 2016 reboot (with its all-female cast), got it wrong. Reitman has been clear that he is an admirer of Feig’s film and that the inspiration for making it, other than being the son of original Ghostbusters director Ivan Reitman, was an image that came to him of a young, female ghostbuster. “We wanted to make a love letter to the original movie,” Reitman told an audience at a fan event in 2019. “I did not expect to be making a new Ghostbusters movie. I thought I was going to be this indie dude who made Sundance movies. And then this character came to me. She was a 12-year-old girl. I didn’t know who she was or why she popped into my head, but I saw her with a proton pack in her hand. And I wrote this story … It started with a girl and all of a sudden it was a family. And eventually I knew this movie that I needed to make, that I needed to write.” That 12-year-old girl will be played by Mckenna Grace in the new film, with Stranger Things’ Finn Wolfhard as her brother and Paul Rudd and Carrie Coon as her mum and dad. The new movie centres on a family that moves to the countryside after being evicted from their New York home. There they discover a connection to one of the original Ghostbusters. A new clip from the movie suggests Reitman will make the most of the nostalgia factor, and yet its vision of tiny Stay Puft Marshmallow Men getting their Gremlin on in a local supermarket certainly warms the cockles. Could it be that Afterlife ends up pleasing both fans of the original movie and the Feig reboot? Can’t we all just get along? The fact that Reitman’s film managed to persuade Murray to return as Dr Peter Venkman certainly bodes well. The veteran comic once considered reprising his role as the womanising parapsychologist in an abandoned project that would have pre-dated Feig’s movie, but which failed to pass muster at a screenwriting level. “They just don’t have a really good script,” Murray told David Letterman in 2012. “It’s hard. You know, even the second Ghostbusters wasn’t as much fun for me as the first one. It’s hard to make a sequel. That first one was so darn funny. It’s hard for me.” If we buy this picture of Murray as quality control executive of the Ghostbusters series (and this is, after all, the guy who headlined not just Garfield: The Movie but it’s even more execrable sequel Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties) then the fact that the actor has described the new project as “good”, with “lots of emotion in it” and “through lines that are really interesting” ought to be a reason to welcome it. It’s certainly hard to blame Murray for taking 30 years to return to the franchise, given some of the nuthouse ideas Aykroyd tried to foist upon him in earlier, abandoned, sequels: Ghostbusters III: Hellbent was set in a darkling mirror version of New York that has started to evict its ghoulish inhabitants, in an only slightly clumsy nod to the real Manhattan’s gentrification. Venkman was due to cameo as – you guessed it – a ghost. Quite how Afterlife will bring back the film’s original cast, given that it is set a long way from Manhattan, remains to be seen. The small-town setting seems to cleave closer to the world of Stranger Things than to the 1984 original, but perhaps that’s just the shaking-up this saga needs. Now if only Reitman can coax the wonderful Rick Moranis back to once again play nerdy Louis Tully – please, even if only for even the briefest of cameos – the film-makers might just be crossing streams all the way to box-office glory.	827
Melissa McCarthy’s moderate new superhero comedy vehicle stars McCarthy opposite Octavia Spencer, and is written and directed by her husband, Ben Falcone, who has a cameo as a hapless henchman called Kenny – the subject of what may or may not be a South Park gag. In an alternate universe where the US is threatened by super-villains called Miscreants, Lydia (McCarthy) is a big-hearted kid from Chicago who in high school protects a super-smart girl called Emily from bullies; they become best friends who lose touch in adulthood. Lydia grows up to be a lonely, boozy worker in a packing plant but Emily – now played by Octavia Spencer – becomes a tech zillionaire developing genetic treatments to turn ordinary people into superheroes. When Lydia drunkenly blunders into Emily’s lab, insisting on taking her to a class reunion, she accidentally plugs herself into the equipment and gives herself super-strength. And so exasperated high-achiever Emily figures they might as well team up to form Thunder Force, battling a Miscreant called Laser (Pom Klementieff – Mantis, from the Marvel Cinematic Universe), together with a bad guy called the King (Bobby Cannavale) and his associate the Crab, someone with pincers for arms – a role for Jason Bateman that again proves Bateman’s comically self-aware likability has never worked as well as it did in the role of Michael Bluth in TV’s Arrested Development. As ever, the comedy is mostly in the premise and the opening act when the heroine’s still-pristine loser status activates the irony and the laughs. From there on, the action needs a growing measure of seriousness, although there is some banter between the King, the Crab and the cringing henchmen subordinates, and a nice role for Marcella Lowery as Emily’s mum, hoping that Emily and Lydia might be a couple. This is by-the-numbers stuff, not quite funny enough for comedy or having enough of the crazed seriousness that marks out a successful superhero franchise. • Thunder Force is out on 9 April on Netflix.	380
I have championed A View to a Kill before. I have repeatedly exalted its star. I have explained how my friend Tom introduced me to the deathless tao of Sir Roger Moore. Life is far too short and miserable to take it all too seriously. So don’t. I’ve even interviewed Tom about his love for Gold, Moore’s 1974 non-Bond masterpiece which essentially supplies the plot for A View to a Kill: a villain plans a calamitous flood to boost the price of a commodity he wants to control (microchips this time), only to be stopped by an ageing knitwear model and the women he seduces. So when I was charged with making the case that A View to a Kill is not the subject of ridicule it has in some places sadly become, I discussed it with Tom. He’s currently surviving lockdown in south London with only pillows with Sir Roger’s face on them for company, which even he would admit is a bit odd. Such devotees of Kill, as we true initiates know it, have developed a flourishing subculture. Among key artefacts one day to be puzzled over by digital archaeologists is this video about how Max Zorin, in this very 1985 entry in the canon, “finds a computer indispensable”. There is also Robbie Sims, author of Quantum of Silliness: The Peculiar World of Bond, James Bond who I talked to for this piece and who tweets under the handle The Bubbles Tickle My Tchaikovsky. That’s a nod to Pola Ivanova, the oft-overlooked third Bond girl of Kill, after Grace Jones and Tanya Roberts. Played by Fiona Fullerton, she’s the statuesque Russian seduced in a hot tub into which Moore’s pensionable Bond presumably poured Epsom salts. But if all that somehow hasn’t convinced you of the greatness of Kill … here goes. A View to a Kill is a glorious romp, silly and camp but in a magnificently British way most successfully so when it’s actually trying to keep a straight face. Christopher Walken’s Zorin is one of the great Bond villains, totally ridiculous but oddly actually quite evil, cackling behind tinted specs while machine-gunning his own staff. Moore thought that too strong for Bond but I think it channels a key Bond theme: actual nastiness and pain. Ian Fleming wrote the books, remember, and as Christopher Hitchens pointed out, he was a rum piece of work. Then there’s Grace Jones’s May Day, perhaps the greatest Bond girl because she brings rare diversity and agency to the role and because she’s just so gloriously, utterly unusual. Her sex scene with Moore is one of the strangest ever filmed. John Barry provides a stirring score, Duran Duran a stupendous title song. This is Bond as operatic nonsense, the Aida of the oeuvre, grandiose and silly but right. Prey to the vulnerabilities of an ageing star, the joins are sometimes visible. Some of the back projection, while for example Roger is supposedly skiing, is laughable. The famous “quiche” scene, a quite magnificently weird bit in which Bond whips up a nourishing meal for Stacey Sutton (Roberts) using only what he finds in her cabinets, comes after a fight in which it is plainly not Roger kicking a bad guy flush in the head. But those stunt doubles’ work is superb. There’s the Eiffel Tower chase and leap; there’s the car smashed in two and driven through Paris; there’s the firetruck chaos; there’s what Sims perfectly calls “the astonishing blimp denouement”, in which a slow-moving dirigible gets tangled up on the Golden Gate Bridge … and an airship gets into difficulty too. Yes, it’s not Moore having an axe fight hundreds of feet over San Francisco Bay. But it is a stuntman, and his mate playing Zorin. And Zorin’s death, plummeting from said bridge, is touching. Yes, his scientist “father” created him in a Nazi lab. But Dr Mortner’s shout from the blimp is just heartrending. “Max!” It gets me. Every. Single. Time. Moore thought he could’ve done another Bond but he couldn’t, really. The Living Daylights (also criminally underrated, like its star Tim Dalton) would’ve had to have been renamed The Snoozing Goodnights. The 80s were not a time when actors staring their 60s in the face or even waving them a long goodbye could be held upright by CGI and our insatiable hunger for content. But what a note to go out on. Made by professionals, A View to a Kill is a glorious outbreak of fun. It’s not serious Bond but as I have written before, serious Bond is not, ultimately, something that deserves to be taken seriously. A View to a Kill is the pinnacle of Moore and therefore the pinnacle of Bond. The defence rests. For now. A View to a Kill is available to rent digitally in the US and UK	965
It’s an unexceptional wedding. Perhaps the cocktail bar aesthetic is a touch on the cheesy side. Perhaps there are a few sexual misadventures. Certainly a lot of beer is consumed, most of it by Nyles (Andy Samberg, excellent in a role that harnesses his comic talent but hones it into a performance of unexpected depth). But what is unusual is the location, next to a portal that leads to what Nyles nonchalantly describes as “one of those infinite time loops you might have heard of”. It’s a sly nod to the fact that cinema has been caught in this particular high concept before. But surface similarities to Groundhog Day are relegated to background noise, thanks to the crisp writing and the nihilistic bite of the humour. When we join the wedding, Nyles has already been caught in the loop for long enough to have relinquished hope and any pretence of giving a damn. But the endless inevitability is disrupted when Sarah (Cristin Milioti), sister of the bride and a velvet-eyed car crash of a woman, is sucked into the same repeated day. And the infinite grind of repetition suddenly takes on an element of fun. An insouciance of approach is evident in the film’s synthetic colour palette of Hawaiian shirt primaries and visual gags, such as the yin and yang placement of two inflatable pizza slices in a pool. But there are weightier themes. It’s a film about fatalism versus fierce and emphatic free will; settling versus risking it all. Covid brings an added resonance: what is true love, after all, if not actively aching to spend time with the person with whom you’ve been flung together for what seems like an eternity?

This year’s Bafta list has confirmed the amazingly meteoric career ascendancy of Chloé Zhao, the Chinese-born film-maker whose debut movie was just six years ago and who was unknown outside arthouse-connoisseur circles until relatively recently; she now is set to rule awards season with a remarkable film displaying her now fully developed authorial signature. Zhao’s outstandingly original and formally adventurous docudrama Nomadland has got best film, best director and also best actress for the perennially popular Frances McDormand who was shrewdly cast; her brilliance at conveying a certain kind of unassuming authenticity and unHollywood Americanness made her exactly right for this – a star who can blend in with nonprofessionals who Zhao has so far always used in her films. McDormand plays a “nomad”, a type of financially stricken American retiree, pauperised by the 2008 crash, identified by journalist Jessica Bruder in her 2017 book Nomadland, on which the film was based. She has to sell up and tour around the country in a campervan looking for seasonal work, such as in Amazon fulfilment centres. Zhao dramatises this fictional character, but uses genuine “nomads” and cleverly folds McDormand into the real-world people whose lives, though punishingly tough, are in some ways liberated. The film is challenging because it daringly suggests that Nomadland is a place of revelation to these people in their declining years; their hardship is balanced by a belief that jettisoning their material possessions has been a relief. It is such an original and bold piece of work, with intelligence and artistry. Really, no actor other than Anthony Hopkins was possible for the Bafta best actor – his performance in the emotionally wrenching dementia drama The Father, directed by Florian Zeller, has had audiences – and this critic – in floods of tears. And Zeller and Christopher Hampton are probably worthy choices for best adapted screenplay, having so adroitly converted Zeller’s stage play (although I was tipping Moira Buffini for her vigorous script work on John Preston’s novel The Dig). Hopkins’s performance in The Father could be his best ever. And there is something not just desperately sad but also terrifying in the decline that Hopkins portrays, something to compare with his recent Lear on BBC TV, moaning: “Let me not be mad … ” I am very pleased to see Emerald Fennell’s Promising Young Woman get two Baftas, for best original screenplay and outstanding British film. This lethal, sulphurically incorrect rape-revenge nightmare, starring Carey Mulligan as an emotionally damaged young woman who pretends to be falling-down drunk in clubs to entrap men, was clearly created with a view to provoking and offending. So it has proved. It is disliked by some critics for being a cop-out, and endorsing the ultimate authority of the police. For me, this is to overlook its status as black comedy and its brilliant, satirically insurgent energy. Daniel Kaluuya’s superb performance as Chicago’s radical Black Panther leader Fred Hampton in Judas and the Black Messiah is a resounding win for a great British talent – although the best supporting actor Bafta perhaps doesn’t do justice to his above-the-title star quality. I also loved Lee Isaac Chung’s Minari, his autobiographical movie about a Korean-American family living on a farm in 80s Arkansas and it’s a shame it wasn’t up for best film, but it’s a treat to see veteran Korean player Youn Yuh-jung rewarded with the best supporting actress Bafta for her lovely performance as the cantankerous grandma. In a way, the same goes for the joyous, beautiful and unexpectedly profound Pixar animation Soul; that could easily have been a best film contender, and was maybe unfairly corralled in the animation ghetto. But Soul’s best animated feature Bafta was obviously just. My one big disagreement is with the best foreign film winner. There were some toweringly great movies listed as nominees here – including Minari, Jasmila Žbanić’s searing Bosnian war drama Quo Vadis, Aida? and Andrei Konchalovsky’s Dear Comrades. But Bafta has (as I suspected) gone for Thomas Vinterberg’s amiable but not terribly profound – and often quite silly – booze comedy Another Round, which has been overrated all round. Elsewhere, the social-realist adventure Rocks has been a jewel of this year’s award season – a film with heart and soul and glorious energy, and so it’s been wonderful to see the Rising Star Bafta go to its star Bukky Bakray. Great things – which is to say, more great things – are expected from her. A satisfying Bafta list, topped off by the grownup artistry of Chloé Zhao.	869

Sequin (the remarkably assured Conor Leach) is 16, but adds two years to his age to buy entry into an adult world of covert gay hookups. The no-strings connections he scrolls through on his phone during his English lessons exert a fascination which is thrillingly illicit; infinitely more exciting than the option of dates with lovesick boys his own age. Sequin’s only rule is that he never meets anyone twice. Then he encounters a handsome stranger in an anonymous sex party – located in the throbbing blue room of the title – and his quest to find the man reveals that, for all his poised appeal, Sequin is out of his depth. This feature debut from the Sydney-based writer and director Samuel Van Grinsven may tackle familiar material – gay coming-of-age stories are hardly uncommon – but it does so with a lustre and style that marks Van Grinsven out as a name to watch. Perhaps even more notable is Leach, a silky, feline presence who owns every moment that he’s on screen. On multiple VOD and virtual cinema platforms	198
In the 2020 drama Mogul Mowgli, co-writer and star Riz Ahmed played a British-Pakistani rapper struck down by a debilitating illness on the eve of his international breakthrough. In Sound of Metal, which premiered in Toronto in 2019, Ahmed plays an American drummer whose life is turned upside down by the onset of deafness. Stylistically these two films could not be more different; Sound of Metal is acutely realist with a docudrama edge, while Mogul Mowgli has been described as a “Sufi horror musical melodrama hybrid”. Yet both films are concerned with identity, a thorny issue with which Ahmed wrestled in the eye-opening 2020 short The Long Goodbye, and which runs through his finest work, including this remarkable Oscar contender. Ahmed is Ruben Stone, drumming with singer-guitarist Lou (Olivia Cooke) in the noise-merchant two-piece Blackgammon. They’re partners on and offstage, touring the US in a converted RV that doubles as a recording studio. But when Ruben’s hearing abruptly fails, he finds himself outside the bubble in which he has existed for so long. Having ignored medical advice to avoid loud sounds, recovering addict Ruben is guided by his sponsor, Hector, to a retreat run by Joe, brilliantly played by Paul Raci, the veteran stage and screen actor who is himself a child of deaf parents. Here, the possibility of a new life is offered. But will Ruben’s desperation to regain his hearing thwart future growth? Directed and co-written by Darius Marder, who made the 2008 treasure-hunter documentary Loot, Sound of Metal has its roots in an unfinished project by Derek Cianfrance, with whom Marder collaborated on the screenplay for The Place Beyond the Pines. Entitled Metalhead, Cianfrance’s uncompleted film was to have starred real-life sludge-metal duo Jucifer in a fictional story about hearing loss. The bones of that abandoned project were taken up by Marder, whose grandmother was deaf, and who co-wrote the Sound of Metal script with his musician brother, Abraham. With astonishing verisimilitude, Marder conjures a world in which every detail rings true. From the wall-of-noise ambience of Ruben’s rock performances (shot live, in front of real crowds) to heated group debates conducted in American sign language (ASL), Sound of Metal finds universal appeal in the specifics of detail, rooted in Ahmed’s thrillingly committed performance. “The deaf community taught me what it means to listen,” Ahmed has said, describing the physicality of signing – of using the whole body as an expressive tool. There’s something sublime about watching a performer of Ahmed’s calibre step up to the next level, as if his craft has been amplified by learning this new language. While Ruben may hide behind his words, Ahmed has never been more emotionally expressive than when communicating through ASL. There is a deft allusion in the title Sound of Metal to the distorted tonalities that beset Ruben when he turns (against Joe’s advice) to cochlear implants. Having brilliantly evoked Ruben’s experience of physical rather than aural vibrations (he can feel the drums, even if he cannot hear them), composer/sound designer Nicolas Becker and his team conjure a harsh electronic dissonance that seems to echo Ruben’s inner conflict. Just as addiction is a central theme, so Ruben’s desperate desire for surgery becomes a metaphor for a wider crisis of faith, an identity struggle embodied in the multilayered sound design. At times I was reminded of the 2014 Ukrainian drama The Tribe, which, for all its ultra-bleak nihilism, still captured the essence of a collectivist community, a community in which Ruben is welcomed and estranged. Like the underrated 2016 British masterpiece Notes on Blindness, which was released in audio-described and enhanced-soundtrack versions to maximise accessibility, so Sound of Metal is presented with open captions, meaning that in cinema screenings (remember those?) deaf and hearing audiences can experience the film together. That’s fitting for a film that deserves to be seen by the widest possible audience, reminding us of cinema’s unique ability to challenge, entertain, uplift and unite. • On Amazon Prime from 12 April and in cinemas from 17 May	787
Ultraviolence is too often seen as a cinematic end in itself – but the results are often ugly, boring, or both. This Canadian home-invasion thriller falls into this trap, so ferociously focused on the scent of blood that it double-kneecaps one character not once but twice: by hammer, then by gunshot. But given that co-director Gabriel Carrer’s past credits include Kill, The Demolisher, and Death on Scenic Drive, we probably shouldn’t be expecting The Bridges of Madison County here. The film starts as a mysterious and alarmingly claustrophobic three-hander: nurse Romina (Lora Burke) knocks off a long Halloween shift and comes home to find that wild-eyed Chris (Nick Smyth) has taken her landlord Alan (Colin Paradine) hostage. Chris claims Alan raped his daughter five years ago; the courts let it slide, and he wants to extract the confession that will justify him taking the ultimate revenge. “This kitchen is not a courthouse, and I am not a clerk,” says Romina. But adjudicating the truth is exactly what she must do – potentially enraging Chris, on the shortest of leashes and who may be projecting his own misdeeds on the man hogtied to a chair. Sadly, when Alan manages to call in outside help, the film drops this high-tension triangle and lets slip the dogs of gore. This squanders some impressively unhinged acting by Smyth, alternating between a rigid thousand-mile stare and surges of raving abandon that suggest an out-of-body experience. One early, promising scene in which Sarah resuscitates Alan with one hand while sweet-talking her son on the phone with the other showcases all the tension lost in the glassy-eyed – and sometimes illogically staged – bloodbath that takes over. The daft title tries to promise splatterhouse brazenness, but actually fesses up to the film’s lack of imagination. For the Sake of Vicious is released on 19 April on digital platforms.	356
This sci-fi-laced British thriller, from Czech director Martin Grof, aims for lofty metaphysical heights but trips over its own feet. Next to the films it draws from, it’s like a Tesco Value version of The Matrix, or as if Inception was taking place in the mind of a lobotomy patient. On a tiny budget, it’s no disgrace to fall short of these illustrious inspirations, but Sensation never recovers from the fact that Grof – co-writing with Magdalena Drahovska – seems unable to tidily convey its central premise. Looking to delve into his family history, postman Andrew (Game of Thrones’ Eugene Simon) has his DNA sequenced – but is told that he is part of an elite cohort of humans with hyper-acute sensory perception. Arm-twisted into joining a training group of similarly gifted individuals at a country house retreat, he learns that his sensitivity leaves him vulnerable to having his senses “hacked” and input with false information. Cue nested realities in which, under the tutelage of an adept (Jennifer Martin) cribbed from the Wachowskis’ Woman in a Red Dress, Andrew must learn to distinguish the real from the illusory. And also to manipulate the senses of other operatives involved in some kind of global conspiracy – something nodded to in a prologue put together with as much clarity as Kanye West’s political programme. This already convoluted setup bamboozles further as it picks up speed. It’s suggested that some of the students specialise in different senses, but apart from Andrew (hearing, smell) it’s not clear who does what, and neither are the rules of how everyone interacts. If these sensorial hallucinations are entirely fake and imposed, how can some aspects be true? What’s the point of learning to dupe others if it only affects a minuscule subsection of the population? Periodic catchups from Lady Exposition (AKA Nadia, another frosty teacher, played by Emily Wyatt) fail to enlighten. Grof at least does handle the transitions between realities reasonably inventively, making good use of the ever-more-unreal City of London. There is a certain Cartesian buzz to be had from Sensation if you abandon all hope of following the plot, and let it wash over you. But that won’t help when it tries to land a final twist that is supposed to bend minds, but is more likely to exhaust patience. • Sensation is available on 16 April on digital platforms.	457
This ultra-low-budget feature about working-class cousins on temporary release from Dublin’s Mountjoy prison feels a bit like the sort of sketchy, acoustic-sharp Irish black comedy that Lenny Abrahamson (Adam &amp; Paul, Garage) or Martin McDonagh (from the In Bruges period) made in their early years, before they went electric and found mega-fame Stateside directing the likes of Room and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. That’s a high compliment, and possibly a teensy bit more than Be Good or Be Gone deserves, given it’s a smidge trite and over-the-top in places – but it definitely has spark. Its strongest suit is the chemistry between Les Martin (who also co-wrote the script with Paul Murphy) and impish master of deadpan Declan Mills, who play Ste and Weed respectively They’re ordinary types from Dublin’s rougher zones who, in the case of Ste, blew the chance of a sporting career by getting sucked into the world of drugs and crime. Ste’s mistakes ended up costing an old friend his life, and it looks likely things will never be right with his girlfriend Dee (Jenny Lee Masterson, bringing nuance to a thinly written role), the mother of his too-cute-to-be-true moppet of a daughter Ellie May (Grace Cahill, admittedly adorable). Consequently, Ste has at least got himself clean and off the skag, but the same can’t be said for Weed, who when we first meet him is wondering if he can smuggle heroin out of prison just to make sure he’ll have a supply. Even so, Weed has ambitions to become a high-fashion designer and is already practising how he’d walk the catwalk for his post-show bow. This is amusing because he looks and sounds just like all the other smackheads in track pants they meet, and is clearly on the wrong side of 35 to break into fashion – but nevertheless, he’s keeping an eye on those stars while lying in his gutter bed. Over the course of their sojourn outside the walls of Mountjoy, the two confront their past, get involved in an armed robbery and are brutalised by former associates looking to collect debts. Some of the side characters are a little too self-consciously quirky-cute, and it’s all tied up a bit too neatly, but this definitely has charm. • Be Good or Be Gone is released on 13 April on digital platforms.	457
One of John Ruskin’s many achievements was single-handedly creating a modern academic industry with the ambiguous way he described his unconsummated marriage to his young Scottish bride Euphemia “Effie” Gray. In the course of legal correspondence connected to their divorce, the great Victorian critic claimed there were “circumstances in her person” which disgusted him. Did that mean her pubic hair? Was he just reacting hysterically to her general nakedness? Was she eating chips in bed? Either way, Ruskin launched a million PhDs on Victorian sexuality, and now Emma Thompson has written an unexpectedly entertaining movie about this marital disaster and Gray’s subsequent romance with the painter John Everett Millais. It’s a little hammy and soapy, with an occasional Pythonesque sense of its own importance but this film, directed by Richard Laxton, is performed with gusto. As Effie herself, Dakota Fanning carries off the role competently, though with the American actor’s habit of playing British accents too slowly. Greg Wise does a good villainous turn as the obnoxious Ruskin: an obtuse and petulant Casaubon creep with a possible abuser’s taste for the green and unripe flesh. Julie Walters steals every scene as Ruskin’s overbearing mother, who turns Effie’s early married life into a grisly Rebecca nightmare. Effie Gray is re-released on 19 April on digital platforms.	254
At last we approach the Great Undelaying. Cinemas are finally reopening (17 May in the UK) and, after a year of perpetual postponement, studios are committing to putting some films in them. It has been a long wait. In some cases, too long. Most movies have a shelf life, even if their makers don’t realise it. Some will play pretty much the same even after being mothballed for more than a year, but with others it might feel as if they’ve missed their moment. We have already had that feeling with Wonder Woman 1984. With its themes of truth and deception, and its villain being a sleazy, megalomaniac TV personality who makes undeliverable promises, it felt like a story hatched in the fever of the Trump era. The film was intended to come out last June, ahead of the US presidential election. When it was released in December, its message felt redundant. Other fims are suffering from what we might call “unforeseen toxicity”. Had Kenneth Branagh’s all-star Death on the Nile come out last October, as originally intended, Armie Hammer would have been just another name on the poster. Six months later, things are very different. After allegations of rape and sexual assault (which he denies), he has removed himself from several projects. But it’s too late to do anything with Death on the Nile, except maybe let it die a quiet death on Disney+. On the flipside, some movies could accidentally benefit from having held off. Edgar Wright’s Last Night in Soho would doubtless have been as well-received last September as it will be (hopefully) this October. In the interim, though, Anya Taylor-Joy has become a huge star thanks to The Queen’s Gambit, which can’t hurt. (Taylor-Joy’s much-delayed superhero flick The New Mutants, which finally limped out late last year, must be kicking itself). Likewise, interest in Marvel’s The Eternals (now due November) could be that bit broader now Nomadland has put its director, Chloé Zhao, on the map. What of other long-anticipated movies? Will it matter in No Time to Die that the state-of-the-art Bond gadgetry is last year’s model? Have In the Heights and West Side Story missed the post-Hamilton wave they might have been hoping to catch? Will it be weird seeing a 16-year-old Finn Wolfhard in Ghostbusters: Afterlife when he’s pushing 19 in real life? In the broader sense, will any of these delayed movies feel truly “fresh”? It will be a sobering realisation if the films that benefit most from the delay are the ones with the least to say about their times, but it’s still too early to predict or elect winners. Still, the enforced interruption might at least refocus the industry’s attention on whether it wants to make a quick buck or something more enduring. A hit movie can be a flash in the pan; a great movie lasts for ever.	576
Actors and directors are lamenting the closing of Los Angeles’s celebrated Cinerama Dome, a staple for red carpet premieres. Los Angeles county recently announced that indoor movie theaters can operate at 50% capacity. But amid financial struggles, Pacific Theatres and ArcLight Cinemas said on Monday it will not be reopening its 300 theaters, including the Cinerama Dome, throughout California. “After shutting our doors more than a year ago, today we must share the difficult and sad news that Pacific will not be reopening its ArcLight Cinemas and Pacific Theatres locations,” a statement from the chain’s owner, Decurion, said. “This was not the outcome anyone wanted, but despite a huge effort that exhausted all potential options, the company does not have a viable way forward.” The actor Mindy Kaling tweeted her hopes that someone would step in and save the theaters following the announcement. “We’ve all been on bad dates to the Arclight where you’re watching a Greta Gerwig movie &amp; the guy doesn’t like it bc he knows Greta is more talented than him and also would never date him and you had the realization you can’t date this kind of guy anymore, so SAVE THE ARCLIGHT,” she wrote. The actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt had fond memories. “I remember going to the Cinerama Dome to see Star Trek IV with my dad when I was little,” he said. Gina Prince-Bythewood, director of Love &amp; Basketball, said the announcement was “painful”. “The Arclight is my go-to. Clean, great sound, assigned stadium seating, great popcorn, usher movie introductions,” she said. Rian Johnson, director of Star Wars: The Last Jedi, commented: “Every single person who worked at the Arclight loved movies, and you felt it.” According to Deadline, Hollywood ArcLight was previously among the highest-grossing theaters in the country. The Cinerama Dome opened in 1963 with the premiere of Stanley Kramer’s It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. Since then, it has hosted a number of red carpet premieres and has been featured in films such as Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, according to NPR. Deadline reports the theater is “the only concrete geodesic dome on Earth. The theater is made up of 316 individual hexagonal and pentagonal shapes in 16 different sizes. Each of these pieces is roughly 12ft across and weigh around 7,500lb.” Decurion thanked guests and employees in its statement. “To all the Pacific and ArcLight employees who have devoted their professional lives to making our theaters the very best places in the world to see movies: we are grateful for your service and your dedication to our customers,” the company said. “To our guests and members of the film industry who have made going to the movies such a magical experience over the years: our deepest thanks. It has been an honor and a pleasure to serve you.”	568
Here’s a self-conscious black comedy from LA film-maker Gillian Wallace Horvat which is precariously balanced on the funny/annoying fulcrum. As Mickey Rooney might have said to Judy Garland: “Let’s make the quirky low-budget film about the ordeal of making quirky low-budget films right here!” Horvat plays a droll version of herself, also called Gillian; her politically contentious script about Israel fails to get funding so she falls back on an idea she’s had on the backburner for a while: a film about how great she’d be as a serial killer. Gillian feels that the manipulative and predatory talents she has as a director are the perfect murderer skillset. Or is it that the nightmare of film-making fills her with murderous rage, along with the resentful rage she already feels towards a certain young woman she nicknames “Stalin”? Heaven knows, her career is at an impasse. Gillian’s manager isn’t interested in her, and she is forced to take meetings with obnoxious film bros who call her work “Weird Frances Ha”. (Not entirely inaccurate, incidentally.) So using hidden cameras, and developing an unlikely talent for burglary, Gillian shoots a snuff-horror odyssey on spec in which she stars as a real-life killer. And sometimes this film is genuinely quite funny – especially when Gillian fastidiously breaks into someone’s apartment and effectively dresses the set to be a movie crime scene. She also picks up a homeless person and asks him if he’s ever been on a film set before. “I thought you might be a former child star or something.” At first meandering, the film does have a kind of sociopath narrative arc as Gillian becomes more adept and confident at killing, although the no-budget aesthetic gets it into difficulties – there appears to be a continuity issue when two different characters wear the exact same T-shirt. Despite the title, Gillian doesn’t blame society. Unapologetic from first to last, she clearly doesn’t think “blame” is relevant. • I Blame Society is released on 19 April on digital platforms.	396
The face of American character actor Richard Kind – melancholy, hangdog, a little dyspeptic – is exactly right for this high-concept midlife satire from director and co-writer Matt Kane. It’s a variation on a familiar theme the time is the near future and Kind plays Felix, an architect in his 60s who has been pushed out of the firm he helped build and is now at home grumpily adjusting to unwanted retirement. His busy wife and grownup daughter have no great need of him these days so poor, emasculated Felix takes comfort in his hi-tech retirement gift: a pair of “Auggie” glasses, through which the wearer can see an “augmented reality companion”, a virtual-reality hologram of exactly the kind of submissively understanding person your subconscious wants to see – in Felix’s case, an extremely attractive young woman (played by newcomer Christen Harper). Felix understands that this is just a projection, a geisha hallucination programmed to respond with the right answers and expressions. But inevitably he begins to fall in love with her, and toys with the “extra” that Auggie owners are invited to purchase: a pair of hi-tech underpants that will allow him to feel his Auggie companion intimately, while his wife is out all day at her prestigious job. This is a movie comparable to Spike Jonze’s Her, in which Joaquin Phoenix falls in love with the Siri-type computer voice played by Scarlett Johansson, and Alex Garland’s Ex Machina, in which Domhnall Gleeson is entranced by the AI robot played by Alicia Vikander; and like those films it creates a dreamy mood of indulgent comedy. Auggie is squeamish about straying into out-and-out nightmare or complete black-comic absurdity, and in fact it isn’t as interesting as Michael Almereyda’s Marjorie Prime with Jon Hamm as the VR hologram of an elderly woman’s late husband, recreated in his younger years. Maybe inevitably, this movie doesn’t quite know where to go after the initial premise, but Kind is watchable as the self-pitying and pathetic Felix. • Auggie is released on 19 April on digital platforms.	395
There’s an unmistakable slow-cinema vibe to this scrupulously observational documentary, which seems somehow to go on for weeks despite its 100-minute running time. The ostensible subject matter is American anthropologist Henry Glassie, who is college professor emeritus in folklore and ethnomusicology at Indiana University; but it isn’t really “about” him in any conventional sense. Instead, the documentary, directed by Irish film-maker Pat Collins, invites us to experience Glassie’s methods for ourselves, in extended sequences in which it simply watches artists at work, seemingly in real time as they sculpt religious icons, build giant coil pots, weave carpets. The accent is very much on “folk” creators – people with little formal art education, rooted in a community, and whose work is (largely) to serve a function, rather than purely aesthetic. Well, it’s fascinating and hypnotic to watch, and for most of the film Glassie, with his luxuriant Mark Twain moustache, is glimpsed only briefly, sitting in the corner of the frame, taking notes, or snapping the odd picture, or, like us, simply watching. The film follows in his decades-old tracks, starting off with Brazilian metal workers and woodcarvers, visits an Anatolian village that makes traditional rugs, and ends up in County Fermanagh where, in the 70s, Glassie recorded the history and music of this border community. The film also stops off in Glassie’s original stomping ground in Appalachia, but it’s a little hard to equate the current inhabitants – slickly professional ceramicists occupying top-of-the-range wooden shed workshops – with the down-at-heel creatives elsewhere. Glassie does, eventually, outline what motivates him, and his love for both witnessing the creative process and mapping the communities where it takes place is evident in what he himself describes as his “terrible sincerity”. “I don’t study people,” he says. “I stand with people and study the things they create.” His watchwords, he adds, are “reverence and patience” – both qualities, I suspect, that you will need to get the most out of this brave, unusual film. • Henry Glassie: Field Work is released on 16 April on digital platforms.	421
The Japanese auteur Naomi Kawase has returned with another of her highly distinctive, tremulously sensitive movies: heartfelt and unhurried, with a tendency to wash the screen in plangent sunlight as the camera looks plaintively up through the branches – and also, a borderline exasperating tendency towards a kind of pass-agg quietism. I have responded variously to this in the past: there was something underpowered in her sucrose drama Sweet Bean but real beauty in other films, such as her award-winning The Mourning Forest. And there is a sustained emotional seriousness in this movie, with committed performances. The story, adapted from a novel by the mystery writer Mizuki Tsujimura, is about the adoptive parents of a five-year-old who are confronted with the possibility that the troubled birth mother wants her baby back – and like so many films with themes like this, there are a few plot holes. Satoko (Hiromi Nagasaku) and Kiyokazu (Arata Iura) are a well-to-do professional couple who are mortified by their failure to have children. They see a TV documentary about an agency called Baby Baton which matches unwanted babies with childless couples (on condition that one of them give up work to be a full-time parent, a stipulation never commented upon further), and Satoko and Kiyokazu are electrified with new hope. Strangely, this appears to be the first time they have discussed or even heard of adoption. They take possession of a baby boy from an anguished and stricken teenage girl Hikaru (Aju Makita) – the formal handover takes place in the presence of the girl’s own shame-filled parents. But five years later, Hikaru calls them on the phone, and then shows up at their apartment, now a slouchingly aggressive young adult, her face almost invisible behind a curtain of hair, very different from the bowing, tearfully submissive schoolgirl they first saw. She is demanding her baby back, or demanding money. Is this, in fact, the girl they met? Is this some kind of scam? Kawase’s story then leaves Satoko and Kiyokazu, and tells us the parallel tale of Hikaru, and what has been happening to her for the previous five years. Of course, no matter how stunned the couple were, they would surely soon demand to know how this girl got their address and telephone number and would be on the phone to the adoption agency to ask that question. And that plot niggle isn’t entirely solved by the realisation that part of the film’s narrative strategy is (eventually) to answer it, but also keep us hanging as to the identity of the young woman who has made this dramatic appearance. Interestingly, this crisis happens at the very moment that they are experiencing the problems of parenthood: they are currently expected to apologise and even pay money to the parents of a little kid who, perhaps wrongly, says that Satoko and Kiyokazu’s son pushed their child off a jungle gym. So there is something interestingly acute about this terrible trial coinciding with a banal, low-key but painful problem – although this is a subtlety which is atypical of the film. True Mothers winds its way up to a C-major ending which tells us what we sort of suspected – that this is not, in fact, a mystery thriller, and also that the concept of the “true” mother cannot be restricted by biology. It takes its time telling us things we know already, but I admired the non-macho aesthetic of the film and the utterly committed performance from Aju Makita. True Mothers screened at the Toronto film festival and is released in the UK on 16 April on Curzon Home Cinema.	684
Richard Rush, the Oscar-nominated director of Freebie and the Bean and The Stunt Man, has died aged 91, reportedly of natural causes. His wife Claudia confirmed the news, saying: “To those who were privileged to know and love him, he will be even more warmly remembered, and missed, for his integrity, his loyalty, his endless generosity of spirit and his boundless support and mentorship of other film-makers, writers or indeed anyone who ever dared to, in the words of his Stunt Man hero Eli Cross, ‘tilt at a windmill’.” Rush’s best known and most widely seen films were made in the 70s. The action comedy Freebie and the Bean, which starred James Caan and Alan Arkin as a pair of maverick San Francisco cops who have to keep a witness alive over a weekend in the face of mafia plans to kill him, was notable for its copious car chases (particularly one stunt in which a car smashes through a bedroom wall). The Stunt Man, released in 1980, starred Steve Railsback as a wanted fugitive who evades the police by pretending to be a stunt man on a film shoot, with the connivance of the film’s director (Peter O’Toole). Rush was nominated for best director and best adapted screenplay for The Stunt Man, with O’Toole nominated for best actor. Born in 1929, Rush cut his professional teeth making TV spots for the US military during the Korean war, before making a string of features in the then underground independent production sector, which took on subjects aimed at the counterculture: racetrack drivers in Thunder Alley (1967), outlaw bikers in Hells Angels on Wheels (1967) and The Savage Seven (1968), and the Haight-Ashbury hippie scene in Psych-Out (1968). Three of them – Hells Angels on Wheels, Psych-Out, and Rush’s super-cheap debut teen-pregnancy drama Too Soon to Love (1960) – featured a young Jack Nicholson. Rush graduated to studio film-making with Getting Straight (1970), an early entry in the Hollywood new wave that examined the political unrest on college campuses of the time, with Elliott Gould and Candice Bergen as students who confront the institutional hierarchy. It was a commercial success, but Rush would only release one more film – Freebie and the Bean – in the 70s as he struggled to get The Stunt Man off the ground. After that film’s release, he then tried to get Vietnam war comedy Air America into production with Sean Connery in the lead role, but eventually left the project and was replaced by director Roger Spottiswoode. Rush’s final feature film credit was the much-mocked 1994 erotic thriller Colour of Night, which starred Bruce Willis as a colour-blind psychiatrist and Jane March as a mysterious woman with whom he has an affair. Colour of Night was given a Golden Raspberry award as the worst film of the year, but has since acquired a cult status.	560
Veins of the World sees Mongolian director Byambasuren Davaa, whose debut, The Story of the Weeping Camel, earned an Oscar nomination for best documentary, again turn her evocative, naturalistic lens on to the lives of nomadic tribes in her home country. It’s something of a pity that, having made its festival rounds, the film gets its release during the pandemic, as its arresting, expansive portraiture of Mongolian rural landscapes would have made an indelible impact on the big screen. Right from the beginning, an alluringly green vista takes over the frame; the potency of the land is breathtaking. Nevertheless, amid this poetic lushness, barren patches slowly appear. Not only the fertile soil but also a traditional way of life is in danger of being eaten away. Shattering changes are seen through the eyes of 11-year-old Amra (Bat-Ireedui Batmunkh), who is especially close to his mechanic father, Erdene (Yalalt Namsrai); Erdene leads his fellow nomads in their resistance against the encroachments of mining companies. Unfortunately, tragedy strikes and Amra’s childlike innocence hardens into a resolute determination as he becomes a one-boy-army against the destructive forces of modern commerce. With a location as awe-inspiring as the Gobi desert, there’s always a danger that the setting will overshadow the drama, but Batmunkh’s committed performance is an emotional anchor that keeps the film clear of maudlin abstraction. Though dealing with overexploitation on a giant scale – these mining operations have even emptied rivers – Veins of the World is more interested in documenting the rituals of nomadic life. Amra visits the holy shaman tree, which bears witness not only to the child’s familial trauma but also to the damage being wreaked daily on his ancestral land; this tenderness renders the desecration of the environment even more heartless and shocking. Though perhaps naive in its understanding of systematic exploitation, Veins of the World is intimate and sweeping all at once, and has at its core a sincerity that invites genuine empathy. •Veins of the World is available on 13 April on YourScreen.	386
The arrest in Belarus of the director of Minsk’s Watch Docs festival of nonfiction cinema is a reminder of how much culture workers matter in authoritarian states and at times of information deficit. On 5 April Tatsiana Hatsura-Yavorskaya’s home was searched by security forces, phones and computers were confiscated, and she was arrested. The ostensible reason was that she had co-organised (with Natalia Trenina and Yulya Semenchenko, who were also arrested but since released) an exhibition called The Machine Is Breathing, I Am Not about Belarus health professionals at the time of Covid-19. Following the arrests the online exhibition closed. On 8 April, a court fined Hatsura-Yavorskaya 700 Belarusian rubles for “protesting against police”. Another criminal case is now being prepared, accusing her of “raising money for protests”. In 2019, Hatsura-Yavorskaya visited the Belfast film festival at the invitation of Irish writer Laurence McKeown. The result was an exchange of films between Belarus, Britain and Ireland. As chair of the Belfast film festival and its sister organisation Docs Ireland, I went to Hatsura-Yavorskaya’s Watch Docs festival, and wrote about it for the Guardian. I was deeply impressed by how Tatsiana, a humanitarian activist and mother of four, steered her festival through the storm of KGB intervention, censorship and outright banning of films. Audiences were large and hungry for stories and perspectives outwith those of the state media. We at the Belfast film festival and Docs Ireland call on the authorities in Belarus to release Hatsura-Yavorskaya. And we ask other documentary film festivals, film workers and humanitarians to do the same. Tag @BelfastFilmFes1 on Twitter and we will retweet to the relevant authorities. Nonfiction cinema is our lingua franca. Those who speak it to governments should be defended.	330
Straight out of film school, aged 22, while her peers were off interning, Kendall Goldberg directed her feature debut, this offbeat, earnest movie about a quarter-life crisis (released in the US in 2018). That’s an undeniably impressive achievement, and the film has some interesting ideas about overparenting and how grown-up kids can buckle under the pressure of Mum and Dad’s expectations. But otherwise it feels a bit generic – shuffling the pack of quirky indie movie cliches, not quite funny enough to be a comedy but with too little authentic emotion to work as drama. Jon Heder plays Jeff, the manager of Winky’s World, a bowling alley so poorly maintained that it’s acquired a kind of retro-chic. Jeff is an underachiever, a computer science graduate who takes medication for depression and anxiety. (Heder’s performance is a bit flat – like he sees depression as a giant vacuum cleaner that has sucked away Jeff’s personality.) The job at Winky’s suits Jeff; he likes the routine, it makes him feel safe. But the owner is threatening to sell, so Jeff decides to turn the business into a going concern, with free pizza and live music. This stuff is only ever mildly entertaining, though there’s a funny scene where he persuades the maintenance guy (Steve Berg doing a Zach Galifianakis) to trash-talk Winky’s to potential buyers. The more interesting scenes involve Jeff’s relationship with his prickly sister, trainee doctor Lindy (Anna Konkle) who shows up to crash on his floor with a friend. It turns out that everyone in his family believes that Jeff is a high-flying computer programmer. The suggestion, not fully explored, is that his self-esteem has been crushed by his demanding parents, who seem to have labelled him “the clever one” when the kids were small. His sister confesses to competing with him for their attention: “I had to get into med school to prove that I existed.” It’s a genuinely moving scene in a film where the actors often look like they’re mimicking real feelings. • When Jeff Tried to Save the World is available on Sky on 13 April.	421
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (Ampas) is in talks with the British Film Institute (BFI) to use the latter’s cinema complex, BFI Southbank, as part of the forthcoming Oscars ceremony, according to a report in Variety. Citing “multiple sources”, Variety says that Ampas is looking to use BFI Southbank, in London’s Waterloo, as one of the international “hubs” for its awards show, which is due to take place on Sunday 25 April in Los Angeles. Ampas was forced to change tack from its original plans for a “no Zoom” show after complaints that non-US based nominees would not be able to attend due to Covid regulations, and instead decided to set up a series of overseas event locations to allow participation for those unable to travel. France will have a “hub” at a studio in Paris. If the London event goes ahead, it is likely to take place in the early hours of Monday 26 April, due to the time difference, and controls will be in place to ensure Covid compliance. These will include negative Covid tests, quarantine for non-UK participants, and a restriction on guest numbers. UK-based nominees include actors Carey Mulligan, Daniel Kaluuya and Anthony Hopkins, and director Emerald Fennell. However, government regulations state that “attendees converging on and congregating in a site for a specific discrete performance or activity” are still banned, so any large scale indoor event may require special permission.	281
Here’s a close encounter of the disappointing kind, an anthology movie featuring a trio of sci-fi shorts from the crew behind the V/H/S horror films. Released in the US as Doors but renamed Portal for the UK, the three films together tell an alien-contact story set on Earth after a million portals open up – giant doors that look like they’re covered with shimmery iron-filings from school science experiments. Whatever planet they hail from, the portals do not appear to come in peace; half the world’s population vanish into them. The best of the shorts is number three, titled Lamaj, which stars TV on the Radio’s Kyp Malone as Jamal, a gentle and thoughtful scientist with a lustrous beard who lives alone in a cabin in the woods. Like Amy Adams’s linguist character in Arrival, Jamal communicates with the portals, and invites another scientist – his ex – over to share the moment. They stand there, eyes shining, faces radiant with the pure pleasure of scientific discovery. Then the cops turn up. The second segment, Knockers by Saman Kesh, is the flimsiest. It’s set weeks after the portals’ appearance, when teams of young gung-ho volunteers are being sent into the portals for research. They have 12 minutes inside to gather data; stay any longer and they risk getting “doors psychosis”. It’s a nonsensical film shot with Michel Gondry-style visual trickery, following two volunteers, a young couple (played by Lina Esco and Josh Peck), having a bad trip in a portal. The opener depicts the arrival, that apocalyptic moment when everyone realises Something is Wrong. It’s filmed from the point of view of a bunch of kids in detention – seriously freaked out when birds start slamming against the window, military helicopters buzzing overhead. The three pieces of the science-fiction puzzle fit together to make a bland, incurious picture with little awe at the universe. • Portal is released on 19 April on digital platforms	380
Here’s a deeply unpleasant and misogynistic horror about a woman accused of witchcraft, made in the image of Game of Thrones by British film-maker Neil Marshall (who has directed episodes of GoT). It starts off inoffensively, if shonkily. The year is 1665; the setting might be Essex or perhaps Yorkshire – the characters are a mix of blunt northerners and Essex chappies. Charlotte Kirk (co-writer of the script with Marshall) stars as farmer’s wife Grace Haverstock, whose husband hangs himself after being infected with bubonic plague. “I’m sorry for your loss,” says the landlord of the local boozer; the dialogue is a laughable mashup of modern and ye olden medieval. Grace is raw with grief – though it’s hard to tell from Kirk’s one-expression-fits-all wooden performance. (The costume and makeup departments don’t help, styling her like she’s modelling the cover of a Mills &amp; Boon cover, bodice ripe for the ripping, hair teased to a salon flick.) The village squire (Steven Waddington) accuses Grace of witchcraft after she rejects his advances, and calls in infamous witchfinder John Moorcroft (Sean Pertwee), a predictably pious hypocrite who arrives with a sinister cloaked female servant, Ursula (Suzanne Magowan), at his side. Up until this point, The Reckoning is merely ropey. Then Grace is strapped into a torture device and has a muzzle-like metal mask put over her face (presumably so that the audience can gawp at her being tortured without having to deal with seeing her agony). The witchfinder orders Ursula to turn Grace into a pincushion with tiny daggers. On day four, still not confessing, she is raped with an instrument that looks like a smear-test speculum but splays open to inflict grievous internal injuries. Late on in the third act, Grace gets her revenge – though how she can rampage around slaying after being tortured for days is never explained. The film left me shaking with anger more than fear. • The Reckoning is released on 16 April on digital platforms.	394
There’s overwhelming precedent in film for the separation of LGBTQ stories and those told within the world of sport – two often diametrically opposed parts of life with very little crossover. What crossover there is has often been reductive or bleak, either poking fun or revealing a dark underbelly of intolerance and players forced to remain in the closet. It makes the prospect of optimistic documentary Steelers: The World’s First Gay and Inclusive Rugby Club much more welcome – and a way to modernise a musty narrative. Steelers is a modest film, both in production values and scope, in ways that sometimes work and sometimes don’t: the affecting small moments are often in need of a bigger picture to make them soar. It’s made by one of the London-based club’s former players, Australian reporter Eammon Ashton-Atkinson, who is narrator, director, writer and editor, telling the story of three queer people involved with the team as they compete against other gay clubs in the Bingham Cup. He teases out some moving testimonies and provides a stinging reminder for many straight viewers that coming out isn’t always the happy ending many think it is, and there are still wounds that need to heal over. But the structure is disjointed, flipping around without confidence, from scrappily shot one-on-ones with players to mostly B-roll footage taken at the Bingham Cup. The gameplay scenes aren’t quite immersive enough and the film is missing historical context: how this team – and gay rugby – went from a punchline to an industry. The limited focus leaves Steelers seeming more like promotional material for the club than standalone documentary. It’s clearly made on a shoestring budget and, while well-intentioned, it’s a little too half-baked to land. Best met with a polite clap rather than a hearty cheer. • Steelers is released on 16 April on Amazon Prime Video.	356
This playfully provocative and ingenious rape-revenge satire is about a society that thinks what a shame it would be if the career of a promising young man were ruined over some alleged incident in which both parties were probably drunk. Writer-director Emerald Fennell (a showrunner for TV’s Killing Eve) lands a stiletto jab with her feature debut, and Carey Mulligan is demurely brilliant as the appropriately named Cassandra. She is a med-school dropout and emotionally wounded sociopath who lives at home with her parents and spends her evenings in clubs, pretending to be falling-down drunk in order to entice predatory men to take her back to their place, each murmuring tender reassurances to the effect that he is a “nice guy”. Cassandra has a surprise in store for these men. Fennell and Mulligan show that she doesn’t need to take out a weapon – she needs only to produce her icy sobriety at the correct moment, to switch with exquisitely timed scariness into a unbefuddled character asking these nice guys what they are doing. Of course, there could be some other retribution as well, some off-camera punishment to which the men will submit in return for Cassandra leaving them uninjured – and she keeps a mysteriously colour-coded scorecard in her childhood bedroom. It reminded me a bit of Takashi Miike’s subzero horror Audition, and yet also The Philadelphia Story, when Katharine Hepburn awakens hungover and amnesiac after her drunken evening with James Stewart, and is told by him that nothing happened: “You were a little worse, or the better, for wine. And there are rules about that.” Are there? Promising Young Woman has achieved new notoriety for an apology Variety magazine recently ran for its review. I have written about my disagreements with that review but also my belief in what I’d thought was obvious: the critic should be allowed to express an opinion. Should critics be allowed comment on personal appearance in this way: yes, and not merely because a vast amount of effort goes into creating these visuals. The point here is that what Cassie looks like – and what men think is therefore an appropriate way to treat her – is at the heart of its story and its toxic nightmare. Cassie’s dangerous vocation is there to make everyone in the audience feel uncomfortable indeed – to trigger a convulsion of #NotAllMen indignation, to make its audiences feel those queasy scruples about entrapment. And the nervy thought: wait, surely there are genuinely nice guys out there, guys who would merely want to see such a person safely home, guys who might now have to leave such a victim to her fate because they don’t want to risk looking like a predator, because of … well, because of this very film? This is part of Cassandra’s nihilist malice. She is the dark avenger unconcerned with fairness, who may in fact induce her victim to attempt nice-guy sexual assault for the first time in his life. But she has revealed what was possible. The story proceeds in twist and turns and switchbacks; Mulligan is great at showing when Cassandra is in control of the situation and when she isn’t – and Anthony Willis’s ruthlessly effective musical score underlines both the horror and the sadness. (Incidentally, the film sent me back to Kristen Roupenian’s skin-crawling story The Good Guy.) It is a tightly constructed, well-worked screenplay by Fennell, who appears in cameo as a cosmetics YouTuber giving tutorials in how to achieve blowjob lips. Mulligan has some great scenes – the most excruciating being when, for reasons not immediately obvious, she tries tempting a teenage girl into her car. I was on the edge of my seat for this, and so much else. The promise of fear is fulfilled. • Promising Young Woman is released on 16 April on Sky Cinema and Now.	726
A face-off between Hollywood legend Dustin Hoffman and Toni Servillo, that veteran of contemporary Italian classics by Paolo Sorrentino? Sounds good. But sadly, the two never appear together in the same scene, and the film they appear in is frustratingly underpowered and derivative. Into the Labyrinth is a psychological horror-thriller directed by Donato Carrisi and adapted by him from his own bestselling novel L’uomo del labirinto. The setting is Italy, and a distraught young woman (Valentina Bellè) comes round from sedation in a private hospital room where a calm and mysterious doctor called Green (Hoffman) explains that she had been found, dumped unconscious by the side of the road, apparently by the sinister individual who kidnapped her as a teenager 15 years earlier – a sensational unsolved “cold case”. As a forensic profiler working with the police, he will now ask questions to reconstruct her terrifying existence in the prison which her abductor called the “labyrinth”. At which point the audience is entitled to ask: erm, why are they speaking in English, when all the rest of dialogue is in Italian? Did she learn English in captivity? Meanwhile, a bleary private detective called Bruno Genko (played by Servillo), specialising in banal cases of debt recovery, hears about this young woman’s safe return and finds that it is now his own mysterious destiny to track down her kidnapper who apparently likes to wear a huge rabbit mask – as in the film Donnie Darko. There is some incidental interest in the bizarre comic-book settings and locations and indeed the weird comic book called “Bunny” which appears to have inspired the crazed villain himself. But the narrative focus is damagingly and pointlessly split between Servillo and Hoffman, two actors whose considerable screen presences tend to subtract from each other. And the cheat-twist ending is basically all too familiar. • Into the Labyrinth is released on 19 April on digital platforms.	361
Here is a documentary whose title contains radioactive levels of irony: happiness and joy are very far from what is to be found within. It is a behind-the-scenes profile of the pioneering TV animation Ren and Stimpy, which for those not around in the early 90s, featured an angry chihuahua (Ren) and a dopey, good-natured cat (Stimpy); with its hyper-stylised visuals, bad-taste humour and eye-watering violence, it found a cult status as a mould-breaking kidult show – very much at the adult end of the scale. The film is built around a profile of John Kricfalusi, Ren and Stimpy’s creator and mastermind; presumably it started out as a warts-and-all account of Kricfalusi’s eccentric (to say the least) management style, which culminated in his firing by Nickelodeon in 1992, shortly after the show’s second season began. However, whatever intentions directors Ron Cicero and Kimo Easterwood may have had were upended by the emergence of even more serious accusations: claims of grooming and underage sex, for which he subsequently apologised. Faced with scrapping everything and starting again, Cicero and Easterwood have folded the material into the litany of alleged abusive behaviour in his studio: initially tolerated as mad-genius enthusiasm but evolving into nasty control-freakery. Kricfalusi is interviewed at length (he apparently agreed only after his victims went to the media), as is Robin Byrd, one of his principal accusers. The result makes for an unbalanced final film; even if Kricfalusi emerges as a thoroughly unpleasant, if damaged, character, giving him the room to apologise (again) for sexual abuse has the effect of suggesting that somehow that’s the end of it, and even that it was the result of aberrations triggered by workplace stress. Happy Happy Joy Joy is a dismal coda to a fondly remembered show, with Kricfalusi’s collaborators still distressed over what happened. As one of his co-workers put it: “No one else worked harder to fuck it up than this guy.” • Happy Happy Joy Joy: The Ren and Stimpy Story is available on 16 April on True Story.	396
The prolific director Ryūichi Hiroki has carved out a niche in modern Japanese cinema with his willingness to delve into the darker sides of sexuality. Following a start in the softcore “pink” films, He has moved to the mainstream while exploring subjects such as sadomasochism. Ride or Die, a live-action adaptation of Ching Nakamura’s arresting but disquieting manga series Gunjō, fits perfectly in the director’s transgressive wheelhouse. The moods of Ride or Die alternate between neon-lit cityscapes and sun-drenched open roads. The opening is shockingly baptised in blood: Rei (Kiko Mizuhara), a twentysomething lesbian, has slashed a man to death in his own home. It is later revealed that her victim is the abusive husband of Nanae (Honami Sato), a high-school classmate for whom Rei has held a torch for a decade. In perhaps the most destructive possible declaration of love, Rei has killed for Nanae, and together they embark on a getaway that doubles as a journey to their past. The bloodshed carries a poetic power: the life of a (bad) man is taken, only for the two women to see themselves reborn. Ride or Die is well-made and engrossing, despite its occasionally meandering pace. Texas-born Mizuhara, currently Japan’s most celebrated It girl, is hugely charismatic on screen. It is a pity that the film has damped down the pitch-black humour and sense of apathy found in its source material; the two women are designed to be much more obviously likable, their rough edges softened and the toxicity in their relationship diluted. The conspicuous use of easy listening tunes on the soundtrack doesn’t help, either. In the end though, Ride or Die boasts strong performances, and its beautiful cinematography takes viewers from metropolitan restlessness to the liberating seaside. • Ride or Die is available on Netflix.	346
For those not up to date with the martial arts film canon, Ip Man was a real historical figure: a master of Wing Chun, a type of southern Chinese kung fu, who until relatively recently was best known for having trained the great Bruce Lee. The real Ip died just before Lee in 1972, but his colourful life has since served as a basis for a series of films that have taken varying amounts of liberty with the facts, starting with the Donnie Yen vehicle Ip Man from 2008. In these films, Ip is more than just a historical figure: he’s a legendary character, a fighter for justice against rogue criminals and sinister foreigners, especially in the films that focus on his years as a policeman in Foshan after the second world war, before the communists came to power and Ip and his family left for Hong Kong. Conversely, in Wong Kar-Wai’s The Grandmaster, Ip serves as a vehicle for a languorous contemplation of martial arts philosophy. Scads more have followed of varying quality, and this latest one features Dennis To, playing the character for the third time, in the Foshan policeman stage of the story. To be honest, To is a less engaging performer than Yen, but his moves are nifty and director Li Liming films the fight scenes – which really make up most of the movie – with plenty of style. Li is very keen on crosscutting between quiet and noisy interactions during the fights; in the opening battle, for instance, between Ip and dozens of axe-wielding gangsters, his superior officer (Michael Wong) plays chess upstairs against a foe with the moves in both forms of combat paralleling each other. There’s some ace drunken-style fighting later, and inventive use of props, but the film takes itself a bit too seriously and reshuffles the deck of plot tropes instead of inventing its own ideas. Ultimately, it feels about as meaningful as a pop video, but if you enjoy martial arts films the way others like, say, dance films, it’s pleasant viewing. Ip Man: Kung Fu Master is released on 19 April on digital platforms.	406
Full disclosure: part of the reason I wanted to write this piece was to give myself an excuse to watch The Wedding Planner again. Not that I need to – I’ve watched this movie so many times that I insert quotes from it into real-life conversations, the images of an immaculately coiffed and tucked-in Jennifer Lopez playing in my mind. An early aughts romcom in its purest form, The Wedding Planner brings together the career-driven, talented wedding planner, Mary Fiore (played by J-Lo) and the vaguely southern pediatrician Steve “Eddie” Edison (played by master of square jaw, Matthew McConaughey). They meet when Fiore is almost run over by a vehicle on the hilly streets of San Francisco, at which point Edison saves her, and chemistry and delirium ensue. Only to find out that he is the groom in one of the weddings she is planning. Well, fuck. But while most films of this genre and time have aged incredibly poorly, this one withstands the test of time – with some caveats. Much of this film’s success rests entirely on J-Lo’s perfect shoulders. Her character is a true professional without falling into the cold and heartless trope that often burdens such female roles in this kind of movie, and she is one of the most clear-thinking people I’ve seen on screen. She is also the wedding planner of my dreams. What I would have done to have this woman stand in front of me before I walked down the aisle with her canned but authentic “you are exquisite” speech, a tool belt of wedding emergency items under her blazer. And Mary knows her goddamn worth – as evidenced in the “I know that you know that you need me” line she so deftly deals when asking her boss for a promotion. But she is also a team player, uplifting her hapless co-worker Penny, played by Judy Greer (another triumph of casting) and empowering her along the way. So few Mary Fiores exist in this era of romcom – characters who are multi-faceted, lovable and formidable at the same time – allowing us to bask in this movie without feeling like we must leave our morals and ethics aside. And when Steve tries to act nonchalant about their rendezvous in front of his fiancee, Mary takes him to task, accusing him of “looking for hot pepper” wherever he can (another layered piece of cultural commentary) and giving off clear and mixed signals while engaged to another woman. Not one to be made a fool of, Mary makes Steve do the work, and not even when she is rip-roaring drunk and vulnerable after seeing her ex-fiance does she falter, holding her boundaries and head high. Perhaps the final reason I truly love this movie is Mary’s commitment to her family. She is caring to her sweet, widowed Italian immigrant father, Salvatore, and plays Scrabble with him and his elderly friends as an actually fun hobby, not a savior complex a la Sandra Bullock in Two Weeks Notice. When her father – and here I will admit that the movie really lets Italian Americans down with its bastardization of culture and dialogue – suggests she have an arranged marriage to childhood buddy Massimo, she doesn’t cut him off and walk away, but tries to understand where he is coming from. And he’s coming from a good place! Her parents, she finds out, had an arranged marriage themselves, and an incredibly loving and supportive one until her mother died. I am not one to promote the idea of arranged marriage, coming from a culture where it is rampant myself, but to see Mary navigate these conversations, taking her family’s feelings and past into account is rare in an “American” movie, and I appreciate it. Not to mention, the role that all the parents play in this movie – including Steve’s in-laws, who are pushy and demanding about the wedding. This is a romcom that realizes that these two characters do not exist in a silo as the couples do in contemporaneous films like Never Been Kissed or Bride Wars. That they will not come together and choose to commit to each other without community around them and not just one token friend. My collectivist heart sings. The Wedding Planner is an emotional and visual treat. It’s a love letter to San Francisco, and a movie where everyone retains some sort of power by the end. Even when Steve chooses Mary (sorry, spoiler), his fiancee Fran, feels liberated by his departure. Rarely do we come across this much winning in one movie, and there are few things I can think of that we need more right now. The Wedding Planner is available on Hulu and Amazon Prime in the US and on Amazon Prime in the UK	911
“I thank those who have agreed to revisit these dark times,” reads the title card that closes this drama about a fisherman’s harrowing journey to retrieve the bodies of his two sons. Set in 2002, in the middle of the United Self-Defence Forces of Colombia’s (AUC’s) reign of terror, the film sees José (José Arley de Jesús Carvallido Lobo) drift downriver in his solitary canoe, scouring the debris that has washed up on the beach in search of clues. He knows it is forbidden to remove bodies from their unmarked grave – the otherwise gorgeous Magdalena river. José’s personal quest mirrors the political project of the Belgian-Colombian writer and director Nicolás Rincón Gille; both seek to preserve those who have disappeared under the AUC’s regime. It’s a devastating film, but doesn’t revel in the story’s inherent grimness. In one terrifying, tragicomic scene, José is brought face to face with a paramilitary chief who is obsessed with the Tour de France. Happily, his knowledge of this shared cultural reference ends up saving his life. Gille, who has a background in documentary film-making, pays particular attention to the natural beauty of the Bolívar region, choosing to foreground José’s stoicism instead of the way his life has been ravaged by violence. Lobo, too, is radiant, a pillar of strength holding steady amid a storm of grief. On Mubi	273
The two nominal main characters of this derivative but reasonably amusing computer-animated feature are a pair of teenage kids attending an elite Hogwartsian science school called Cranston Academy in London; the location signified by the fact it rains all the time and the teachers drink tea. Awkward American Danny (voiced, puzzlingly, by British actor Jamie Bell), who prefers to work solo, is forcibly teamed up with prissy but whipsmart Liz from Australia (Ruby Rose). Together, they get the school’s nuclear reactor working, but it opens up a portal to another dimension. This Promethean class project unleashes all manner of monsters, many of whom recall the creatures in Pixar’s Monsters, Inc. but with less affable personalities. The production, directed by Leopoldo Aguilar, emanates from Mexican cartoon studio Anima Estudios, which is interesting because only a tiny amount of animation comes out of the third country in North America, compared with the US and Canada. That also explains why, out of an already culturally eclectic cast of characters, a Mexican scientist is assigned the key role of semi-magical helper character. Known only as Mothman (voiced by Idzi Dutkiewicz) – he’s half-human, half-moth – he speaks the human language with a heavy Spanish accent and also sports wings and has a overwhelming urge to whisper sweet nothings to every lamp and torch he meets, like a lumophilic insectoid Pepé Le Pew. His heritage also allows for one of the funnier gags wherein Mothman, Danny and Liz go to a British “Mexican” restaurant and Mothman is utterly horrified by the atrocities described as “tacos” on the menu. The palette of hot, supersaturated colours is toned down by the use of more subdued tones for the night scenes, and while the character animation is not especially winning, neither is it annoying like too many other cartoon features these days. • Cranston Academy: Monster Zone is available on 19 April on Sky Cinema.	365
Justin McConnell is a Canadian indie director who has here created what amounts to a tiring and self-indulgent video diary of the last five years as he tries to get his passion project made (a fantasy horror called Lifechanger). It is interspersed with what feels like hundreds of thousands of interviews with beaming film people, some very famous (such as Paul Schrader and Guillermo Del Toro), some not so famous, but all giving us their well-meant platitudes about getting your films made by following your dream and realising that it’s all about storytelling. Clapboard Jungle suffers from a weird mix of information overload and a lack of actual, usable information that might be of assistance to film-makers or of interest to film audiences. To an extraordinary degree, this film is packed with endless selfie shots of McConnell’s face as – zonked with stress or anxiety or disappointment – he trudges through airport department lounges on his way to festivals, placidly listens to music on a bus, or takes calls from producers and distributors passing on his project. This isn’t to say that there aren’t some nuggets of information here about the nightmare of independent film production: the money people won’t commit the cash until the talent are definitely on board and the talent won’t sign up until the money is definitely there. So something has to give and someone has to be lied to. At one stage, an actor who’s worked with McConnell gently reproves him about exaggerating the extent and solidity of the funding while the film was in development. But that is the business. As ever, people complain about the deluge of “content” which is sloshing over us all nowadays. Advances in digital technology have made it easier and cheaper to make films, but it hasn’t increased film-making talent or increased the number of people willing to watch the finished product. There is some good sense from Troma’s Lloyd Kaufman: “Nobody complained when there were thousands of paintings and drawings and comic book illustrations – why should anyone complain about too many movies?” • Clapboard Jungle is available on 19 April.	403
The Japanese film-maker Naomi Kawase adapts Mizuki Tsujimura’s 2015 novel in this tender, compassionate drama about the complexities of motherhood. Satoko (Hiromi Nagasaku), the adoptive mother of six-year-old Asato (Reo Sato), is thrown into crisis when a young woman claiming to be her son’s biological mother attempts to blackmail her. The film mostly plays out in flashback, giving context to each mother’s “truth”, and equal weight to both women’s sacrifices. “Baby Baton”, the charity that connects the two, requires Satoko to quit her job and pledge to become a full-time parent, while 14-year-old Hikari (Aju Makita) is told to legally agree to permanently sever all ties with her newborn son. Kawase’s frequent use of handheld camera gives parts of the film a quasi-documentary feel, but it’s the lyrical touches, such as a beam of blinding sunlight that falls on Satoko and her husband after signing the adoption papers, and an oceanic soundscape that recurs throughout, that hit the hardest.

In 2010, the American film-maker Josh Fox released something that in retrospect looks like one of the most influential and original documentaries of recent times: GasLand. It was about something new to many at the time: fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, under the earth to release natural gas from shale rock, at the risk of polluting the water table and turning areas of natural beauty into sludge dumps – and that is aside from the existing larger implications of gas consumption. The film alerted many to a new environmental menace, and it plays its historic role in this new film from Johnny Gogan about the anti-fracking campaign in Ireland, often by people who were energised by seeing GasLand and determined to resist what one campaigner calls the new way of “scraping the bottom of the fossil-fuel barrel”. Exactly so. The coronavirus pandemic has, understandably, diverted many people’s attention from the climate crisis. But there is no vaccination for climate change. Groundswell shows how the fracking industry has been developing its interests in Ireland for many years, especially in North Leitrim, the corporations clearly calculating that it is unlikely to muster much protest because it is so sparsely populated. But communities did come together, with artists and writers joining the movement, and the Irish campaigners have been able to make international common cause with their equivalents in the United States, and draw on their knowledge. Ireland made history by banning not just fracking but also by importing fracked gas, and the fracking corporations are now pursuing their business over the border in Northern Ireland. A lesson to communities and campaigners there and everywhere else to stay vigilant. • Groundswell is released on 16 April on digital platforms.	316
It’s stingingly timely material. Thematically, Emerald Fennell’s feature debut, Promising Young Woman, could have been distilled from pure pain, an amalgamation of the countless rape culture testimonies on sites such as Everyone’s Invited. But tonally, with its extravagantly arched eyebrow and lacquered manicure of irony, this film feels oddly dated – a couple of decades out of step with current sensibilities. Were it not for Carey Mulligan’s Cassandra, an avenging angel in bubblegum-pink lip gloss, the picture may well have toppled off its stripper heels long before it got to stomp into its divisive shocker of a final act. Mulligan’s withering disdain is a thing of beauty. If anyone wins prizes for this liberally and generously nominated film – it has five Oscar nods, including best picture and best director, and scored six Bafta nominations, winning two – it should be her. And for a while at least, the writing matches the quality of her performance. The film’s opening is a DayGlo blast of righteous catharsis. We meet Cassie blurry with booze, slumped across a banquette in the kind of bar where the alpha-bro afterwork crew go to toast themselves. She’s a beautiful wreck, the skirt of her business suit bunched up, hair and life unravelling. Three brash guys eye her hungrily, but it’s the most seemingly decent of them (Adam Brody) who approaches, with the offer to see her home safely. But danger comes in all shapes and sizes, and the next thing we know, the “nice guy” is plying her with emetic-pink kumquat liqueur and manhandling her on to his bed. The scene then takes a joyous swerve into the unexpected. Cassie drops the drunk act and snaps back into focus, fixing him with a glare that is the prelude to a reckoning. Fennell cuts away before we see how the teachable moment plays out. But the next shot rejoins Cassie in the hard light of the following morning, dishevelled but triumphant. She’s devouring a burger. It might be ketchup that trickles down her arm. And then again, it might be blood. When she isn’t bringing her own brand of justice to bear on a seemingly endless stream of creeps, Cassie is unmoored. Having dropped out of medical school seven years earlier, for reasons that become clear later in the film, she is just shy of 30 and still living at home with her parents. She works soul-sapping shifts in a coffee shop, deftly fending off the opportunity for promotion brokered by her well-meaning boss (Laverne Cox). Her resolute avoidance of any kind of hope or future is derailed, however, when Cassie meets Ryan (Bo Burnham), the first person in years who is able to find a chink in her hard-baked cynicism. The film attempts to capture the aftermath of a collision between grief and rage – there’s a kinship with Three Billboards, a similarly polarising picture about one-woman vigilantism. But grief – the draining, exhausting sadness that would prompt someone to relinquish their dreams and ambitions – and the kind of relentless, scalding fury that sends Cassie out, night after night, seeking retribution are two very different energies. And Fennell, who cut her teeth scripting Killing Eve, struggles to strike a persuasive balance between the two. She’s on surer footing with directorial decisions that don’t require such subtle fine tuning. The pick-and-mix candy-colour palette (with particular emphasis on Biro blues and lipstick reds) is bracingly snotty and confrontational; the sly use of angel imagery (a coffee shop logo halo; wings formed from Cassie’s mother’s horrendous decor) is a playfully kitsch detail which is unnecessarily sledgehammered home later by the use of Juice Newton’s Angel of the Morning on the soundtrack. More successful is the use of a subverted version of Britney Spears’s Toxic; a track dismissed as disposable pop fluff, originally recorded by a woman who was consistently underestimated by predatory men, becomes an anthemic battle cry. As the film’s undeniably potent final scene suggests, perhaps there is some justice in the world after all. • Promising Young Woman is on Sky Cinema and Now TV	799
The lots up for auction include an iconic movie script (minus a crucial plot spoiler), a mask that has terrified generations of sci-fi fans and even a chunk of a beloved starship. More than 700 possessions of David Prowse, the Bristolian who played Darth Vader in the original Star Wars trilogy, are being sold off in his home city following his death aged 85 last year. Included is his The Empire Strikes Back script, which has key lines removed to keep Vader’s relationship with Luke Skywalker secret, a piece of the Millennium Falcon’s cockpit and a Vader mask Prowse is believed to have used for appearances at conventions and events. Appropriately, the collection will be sold on 4 May – a nod to the franchise’s famous line: “May the force be with you.” Auctioneer Andrew Stowe, of East Bristol Auctions, said: ‘‘When I was rummaging through the boxes from his house, every now and then I’d come across something special and it would send my brain racing. “In one box I’d find his Empire Strikes Back script, in another I found an actual piece of the Millennium Falcon, then a little deeper down I’d find a letter from Peter Cushing.” The Empire Strikes Back script is expected to sell for thousands. ‘‘My spine tingled when I first saw the script,” said Stowe. But the line revealing Vader and Luke’s relationship does not feature. Stowe said: “The reveal – perhaps the most recognised moment in cinema history – was kept a big secret from most of the cast. As Prowse’s lines would be over-dubbed by James Earl Jones he [Prowse] wasn’t privy to the secret, so instead, he was given alternate dialogue which is considerably less dramatic. But that in itself makes this a unique piece of history.’’ A percentage of proceeds from the auction will go to Alzheimer’s Research UK.	373
A sequel to the successful spin-off film from Julian Fellowes’ Downton Abbey TV series will be released this Christmas. The as yet untitled film began shooting last week, with all key cast members – including Hugh Bonneville and Maggie Smith – returning alongside new faces including Hugh Dancy, Laura Haddock and Dominic West. The TV series ended with a season set during the general strike of 1926; the film was set a year and a half later, and featured a royal visit to the Yorkshire estate of Lord and Lady Grantham. Plot details for the followup film are under wraps. The 2019 film was generally well-received and grossed $194m worldwide. The plot of that movie included the revelation that Maggie Smith’s character, the dowager countess, did not have long to live. Smith, 86, will be returning for the shoot, under what are believed to be enhanced Covid precautions. West will shortly be seen playing Prince Charles in the fifth and sixth seasons of The Crown.	186
The rescheduled 2021 edition of the Cannes film festival has picked Annette, a new film from Holy Motors director Leos Carax and starring Marion Cotillard and Adam Driver, for its high-profile opening slot. The musical, written by Sparks duo Ron and Russell Mael, is described by the festival as “the story of Henry, a standup comedian with a fierce sense of humour, and Ann, a singer of international renown … They are the perfect couple, healthy, happy, and glamorous. The birth of their first child, Annette, a mysterious girl with an exceptional destiny, will change their lives.” It is Carax’s first English-language film and is set in Los Angeles. The film will screen in Cannes on 6 July, after the festival’s opening ceremony, and will simultaneously go on general release in France. Holy Motors, Carax’s last film, screened in competition in 2012. In January, the festival announced that its public event would be moved from its traditional mid-May date to July, after its initial plans were derailed by Covid regulations. The organisers intend to hold in-person screenings; however, cinemas in France are closed as part of a national lockdown that began on 3 April. The Cannes film market, normally held at the same time as the festival, will go ahead as a virtual event in May. The 2020 edition of the festival shelved its “physical” screening programme, replacing it instead with a selection of more than 50 films, including period fossil-hunter romance Ammonite, afterlife animation Soul and ski-competition sex-abuse drama Slalom. The festival said the rest of the selection will be announced in May. However, Cannes artistic director Thierry Frémaux has confirmed that two films from the 2020 list – Wes Anderson’s The French Dispatch, about the Paris office of an American newspaper, and Benedetta, Paul Verhoeven’s film about the real-life 17th-century lesbian nun and mystic – will be included in the 2021 lineup. Spike Lee, who was due to be jury president in 2020, will return to perform the same duties this year. The Cannes film festival is due to run 6-17 July.	403
In Morocco, sex outside marriage is punishable by up to 12 months in prison. But when unmarried Sofia gives birth, in this debut feature from Meryem Benm’Barek, her family’s biggest fear is not her going to jail, it’s preserving their honour. The film is straightforward, a blunt social-realist drama. (Sofia goes into labour at a kitchen sink, while washing up.) Only at the end does it dawn on you how carefully the story is plotted: something happens that recasts everything that has gone before – and, if anything, makes the story even more grim. Maha Alemi stars as 20-year-old Sofia, who doesn’t know that she is pregnant until her waters break during a family party in Casablanca. It’s never clear whether Sofia, who didn’t gain much weight, was completely unaware of the pregnancy; perhaps she suspected it but had blocked it out. Her face is mostly blank, and she walks through the film numbed and zombie-like. After the birth, her family is disgusted – and terrified that a scandal will blow her dad’s business deal with wealthy entrepreneur named Ahmed. (Ahmed is played by Mohamed Bousbaa. Like a bit character in a murder mystery, watch him – he’ll be important later.) Everyone agrees the only solution is to find the man who got Sofia pregnant and persuade him to recognise the baby. Sofia and her rich cousin Lena (Sarah Perles) drive around to find the guy, Omar (Hamza Khafif), who turns out to be no one’s idea of a perfect son-in-law. Benm’Barek refuses to flatten her script into a simplistic tale of misogyny. This is about class, too. If you have the money and the connections, you can bypass the law. Things happen to Sofia that would never happen to middle-class, educated Lena. What a clear-eyed and pitiless film this is; it left me hankering for the chinks of tender optimism in a Ken Loach movie. • Sofia is available on 23 April on Your Screen.	395
Were there an Oscar for best on-screen drunk (which there really should be), it would be a close-run thing this year. My money would be on Aubrey Plaza, who provides a magnificent display of wastedness in her new movie, Black Bear. Playing a neurotic indie actor at the end of her tether, she spends half the movie stumbling, lurching, wailing and losing her dignity. She wasn’t actually drunk, of course. This is the great challenge: acting drunk when you’re sober is no easier than acting sober when you’re drunk. To get into the right frame of unsteadiness, Plaza would spin round until almost throwing up just before the scene. That’s commitment. Giving her a run for her money this year would be Gary Oldman’s Mank (extra points for vomiting) or the ensemble cast of Another Round: four middle-aged Danish teachers who conduct a live experiment in alcoholic microdosing. You can guess how that goes. Again, there was no actual drinking on set. In order to precisely calibrate their drunkenness – “slightly merry” all the way to “bed-wettingly paralytic” – star Mads Mikkelsen and the rest of the cast went on a drinking “boot camp”. All-out drunkenness is the hardest, said Mikkelsen. For that, they watched a lot of Russian YouTube videos. Another Round tackles humanity’s messy relationship with alcohol head-on. Mikkelsen reminds his class that great leaders such as Winston Churchill and Franklin D Roosevelt were high-functioning drunks while Hitler was teetotal. It’s similar with the movies. Old-school hellraisers such as Oliver Reed and Christopher Plummer needed no research on acting drunk, having spent much of their free time “rehearsing”. A few years ago, Plummer recalled how film-making in 1960s Britain usually meant downing tools after lunch – a long, boozy affair that left cast and crew too “pie-eyed” to do anything till the next morning. There is always the “do it for real” approach to onscreen drunkenness, but it rarely ends well. Look at John Cassavetes’s Husbands, for example, in which he, Peter Falk and Ben Gazzara “play” three buddies on an extended drinking binge, which includes bullying women, vomiting and interminable rambling. And while the list of classic drunk films is long and illustrious, some of them look less charming in retrospect: the frat boys of Animal House, for example, or the entitled antics of Dudley Moore’s Arthur. Raising the game this year, in both cautionary drinking tales and the drunk-acting category, is Carey Mulligan, star of Promising Young Woman. Her character’s strategy is to pretend she’s drunk, in order to expose predatory men all too ready to take advantage of her vulnerable state. So Mulligan isn’t simply acting drunk; she’s acting acting drunk. There ought to be a special Oscar for that.	555
There is nothing pure about Monster Trucks. It is not a work of art born from some noble truth. It is a product – brightly colored content meant to generate toys. The idea originated around 2013 when Adam Goodman, then president of Paramount’s Motion Picture Group, watched his four-year-old son playing with toy trucks. By 2014, Paramount issued a press release calling their new title Monster Trucks a “movie which has great toyetic appeal”. This unapologetic ploy to sell plastic made for an ignoble start to Monster Trucks, and things wouldn’t improve. The general concept – monster trucks that have real, but friendly, monsters inside them – didn’t inspire much confidence outside of “toyetic appeal” either. Release dates were missed (originally set for 2015, it would not open until 2017); test screenings tanked (one unconfirmed report states children shrieked in terror at the sight of the friendly monsters); Goodman was fired from Paramount; and the studio took a loss on the picture, which grossed $64m worldwide on a $125m budget. Critics didn’t help, giving Monster Trucks overwhelmingly mixed-to-negative reviews. Yet despite its inauspicious pedigree, there’s a warm, silly heart to Monster Trucks. Once you get beyond the blatant consumerism, you find a sweet, endearingly corny tale of a boy and his monster. Boy probably isn’t the right word, though, because, while main character Tripp is supposed to be a high schooler, actor Lucas Till was in his mid-20s while filming. When we first meet him sitting on a school bus with much younger actors, it looks like someone made a mistake. Tripp wants out of his small North Dakota town, and his only hope for escape is to finish fixing an old junker truck currently void of an engine. He doesn’t have a plan, exactly – just a dream of getting far away, perhaps to some new reality where he’ll no longer look like the world’s oldest high school student. Tripp’s plans are put on hold when he discovers a slimy, squishy, tentacled monster that looks like history’s cutest interpretation of HP Lovecraft’s Cthulhu. This monster and his parents were living in an underground water system, but fracking from an evil oil company accidentally released them. Mommy and daddy monster are captured by the oil company, but the baby monster gets away and soon befriends Tripp, who nicknames the beast Creech. Monster Trucks lives and dies by Creech, and, for all the talk of the monster horrifying kids at test screenings, he’s pretty damn adorable. Say what you will about Monster Trucks; it does not look like a cheap movie, and Creech’s design – all flailing tentacles, blubbery body and kind, expressive eyes – works well. Creech feels more like a fully realized character than the majority of the humans. How can you not root for Creech? Sure, he’s kind of gross and he loves to chug motor oil. But he has the personality of a slime-drenched labrador. He’s just happy to be part of your life. Since Creech is primarily an aquatic monster, he has trouble getting around on land. The solution: Creech slithers into the body of Tripp’s truck, using the vehicle like a super-charged wheelchair. Soon, Creech is taking Tripp on joyrides. Along for those rides is Meredith (Jane Levy), another adult high school student. Bookish and proper, Meredith gets a thrill from running with Tripp and Creech, and Levy nails down her wide-eyed enthusiasm at suddenly breaking some rules. A wisp of a plot forms: Creech wants to save his imprisoned parents from the oil company; a scientist (Thomas Lennon) working for the company sees the error of his ways and helps; and Creech’s mom and pop soon have their own altered trucks to use as transportation. Gravity-defying chases ensue, with the literal monster trucks flipping and spinning and twirling their way to freedom while nameless oil company goons are run off the road. Are these goons killed in the process? Who’s to say? Through it all, a lovable sweetness prevails. You catch a glimpse of the toy commercials beneath the movie, yet there’s something undeniably endearing about watching a nice slime-monster ride to freedom, a fang-filled grin on his face. We like Creech, which means by extension we also like Creech’s friends. Are they well-drawn, nuanced characters? Nope. But they’re all working toward a kind goal. And when Creech finds his way home to water at the end and emits a beautiful, ghostly glow once submerged, it’s enchanting. We, as a society, failed Creech. He deserves better. Monster Trucks is available to rent digitally in the US and on Now TV in the UK	929
