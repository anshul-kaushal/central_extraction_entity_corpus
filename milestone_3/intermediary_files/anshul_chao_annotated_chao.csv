165,Come True review – blow-out imagery in visionary sleep disorder thriller,"There is something visionary about this near-nonsensical, kitsch but atmospheric techno-thriller from Canadian director Anthony Scott Burns. Drawn along on dark somnambulic rhythms, it incorporates elements of fantasy, horror and 80s synthwave aesthetics without giving itself over completely to any of them. A wordless first 10 minutes introduces us to Sarah (Julia Sarah Stone), a runaway student apparently unwelcome or unwilling to return home, waking in spectrally lit parks and falling asleep in coffee shops. Dropping suddenly into surrealistic CGI dreams that track inexorably towards a demonic figure who, if approached too closely, wakes her with a start. Sarah decides to try to climb out of this insomniac bath by enrolling in a university sleep study. It is overseen by Dr Meyer, a Cronenbergian academic in big glasses, but run by a trio of researchers who, like the memory technicians in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, have a loose relationship with scientific protocol. Becoming close to Jeremy (Landon Liboiron), she learns that they are using pioneering technology to observe the subjects’ dreams – and that the same shadowy presence manifests in all of them. But Burns doesn’t pursue this supernatural lead where you would expect, committing instead to a dream-logic that mostly abrogates him of plot duties. Acting as his own cinematographer and editor, he puts together a blow-out of imagery with great technical skill that fleshes out this waking dream of a film. Sarah watches her dream self in Jeremy’s mind’s eye on the monochrome monitors, which later melds into a stylised aquamarine-flooded sex scene that is like a Michael Mann wet dream (a debt acknowledged by the use of Shriekback’s Coelacanth, the spine-chilling tune from Manhunter). Talking is beside the point – and, with Stone adept at mute trepidation, it often feels that way even when there is some dialogue. As for interpreting what it all means, leave that to Burns’s therapist. The flamboyance on display here, though, promises great things. • Come True is released on 15 March on digital platforms.",Come True,FILM
166,Stay Out of the F**king Attic review – secrets are laid bare in efficient horror,"Ex-con Schillinger (Ryan Francis) has been out of the big house long enough to start up his own business as a removal man, and has just hired two more employees, also prison alumni: tough Imani (Morgan Alexandria) and her friend, soft-spoken new father Carlos (Bryce Fernelius). All three have pasts they would like to put in the rear-view mirror of the moving van. But an offer from a creepy old man (Michael Flynn) with a German accent to do a quick overnight cash job will expose each person’s dark secrets and vulnerabilities, including piquing their perfectly natural curiosity when he tells them to shift everything in the mansion but stay out, per the title, of the attic. And the basement for that matter, but presumably director Jerren Lauder and his producers agreed Stay Out of the F**king Attic and Also the Basement wasn’t such a snappy title. Of course, the employer’s command sets the movers in motion and it all comes out: Nazi pasts, monsters, and one unfortunate mover’s eyeball in a particularly gruesome interlude. Strictly in terms of generating jumpscares and gross-out moments this is efficient enough as a cinematic machine, but the script credited to four different people including Lauder hasn’t got a lot of finesse or subtlety. Even for allowing that horror films set in spooky old houses are supposed to be full of dark shadows and blackness, this is especially gloomily lit, so viewing on laptops is not recommended. Tension relieving laughs are few and far between, except for unintended guffaws that might be generated when one character skins part of their own anatomy; but the actor does such a poor job of expressing pain it looks like they merely stubbed their toe. • Stay Out of the F**king Attic is released on 11 March on Shudder.",Stay Out of the F**king Attic,FILM
167,The Adventures of Wolfboy review – charm and vulnerability in magical realism fable,"Broken into arch chapter headings that are introduced with intricate, stylised illustrations like something out of a book of fairytales for Gen Z and millennial misfits, this fey, magical realism fable is an interesting mixture of winning charm, smug knowingness and vulnerability. The screenwriter (Olivia Dufault), one of the young co-stars (Sophie Giannamore from Transparent) and the character she plays are all transgender, and the film is at its best when it is working through issues around dysphoria through the lens of allegory. That feeling of not being at ease in your own body is at the heart of this story about a 13-year-old named Paul (Jaeden Martell, heartbreakingly expressive even under a ton of prosthetics and fake hair) who has a condition that causes him to grow lustrous golden-red fur all over his body, including his face. Teased by peers at school, and already dealing with major abandonment issues after his mother ran off when he was little, he can’t even count on his well-meaning but clueless dad (Chris Messina) to do the right thing. One day Paul runs off to find his mother in that mythical land known as Pennsylvania. Along the way, he briefly becomes a freak show attraction at a carnival run by the menacing if mesmerising Mr Silk (John Turturro, going over the top, round the outside and up from underneath with an outrageously hammy performance); and then falls in love with a beautiful singer around his own age named Aristiana (Giannamore), whose dreary mother insists on calling her by her dead name “Kevin”. First time director Martin Krejci draws lovely performances from his cast, and the whole thing looks dreamy and splendid thanks to Andrew Droz Palermo’s cinematography – but the last act could have done with some serious workshopping to smooth out the motivational kinks and deflationary resolution. Still, it might be the kind of film a kid wrestling with their identity will treasure forever, flaws and all. • The Adventures of Wolfboy is released on 15 March on digital platforms.",The Adventures of Wolfboy,FILM
168,The Little Things review – plodding serial killer thriller,"If it didn’t plod quite so tamely in the footsteps of films such as Seven and Zodiac; if Rami Malek had chosen to use more than one facial expression in his performance, then perhaps this overly familiar tale of obsessed cops and serial killers might feel less stale. As it is, it’s about as fresh as a bloated, bile-tinged corpse dredged from the Los Angeles river, with a markedly similar colour palette to boot. As deputy sheriff Joe Deacon, Denzel Washington’s shuffling gait and round shoulders belie a sharp mind that is wasted in the quiet backwater where he now works. Sent to LA, his old stomping ground, Joe is confronted by former colleagues less than thrilled to see him, and by his successor Jim Baxter (Malek), who is about as wholesome as it’s possible to be in a job that involves scrutinising corpses on a daily basis. Initial hostility warms into mutual respect, as the two men bond over the investigation of a series of murders. John Lee Hancock, who wrote as well as directed the film, is no David Fincher, but his use of colour is bold: green is threaded through The Little Things like a trail of clues – the eyes of a victim, the pistachio paintwork of a suspect’s car, the throbbing emerald of Joe’s hotel room breakdown. But as the detectives start to lose the plot, so does the film, fizzling into an unravelling tangle of loose ends. • On multiple VOD platforms",The Little Things,FILM
169,"Mouthpiece review – two women, one tale of grief","Following the death of her mother, Cass is falling to pieces – a fact that this adaptation of an inventive stage play explores through the device of having two actors simultaneously playing the same character. Norah Sadava and Amy Nostbakken wrote the play and jointly star as Cass; Nostbakken also contributes the film’s haunting and rather lovely score. I wonder if the dual performance might have had a more forceful impact in the stage incarnation; nevertheless, the film is undeniably potent in its account of the shattering force of grief.

170,Locked Down review – Anne Hathaway and Chiwetel Ejiofor are suitably trapped,"In the right hands, storytelling within a framework of restrictions can lead to thrillingly inventive film-making – think the Dogme films, with their vow of creative chastity, or single-location thrillers such as Gustav Möller’s The Guilty or Steven Knight’s Locke. Knight wrote the screenplay for this Covid-19 drama, but the tale of a struggling marriage – Anne Hathaway and Chiwetel Ejiofor are suitably mismatched – pushed to breaking point by the first pandemic lockdown is worlds away from the lean cinema of limitation of Locke. Instead, the film busts a gut attempting to free itself from the confines of the couple’s home. In this, it’s at least true to the spirit of lockdown, but it feels like a missed opportunity. • Available on multiple VOD platforms",Locked Down,FILM
171,Reunion review – Julia Ormond wows in slow-burn Kiwi horror,"Reunion is a two-in-one horror treat, serving up a scary mother and a spooky old house full of secrets. Evil mums are terrifying and pleasurable in equal measure; reflecting our intergenerational angst while pushing the same dynamic to spectacular heights. Here, Julia Ormond’s deliciously passive-aggressive matriarch delivers both campness and genuine unease. Reunion sees the return of Ellie (Emma Draper), an academic studying black magic, to her New Zealand childhood home. Heavily pregnant, Ellie longs for a quiet weekend to focus on her work, but such hopes are dashed by the presence of her domineering mum Ivy (Ormond) who is packing up the furniture in anticipation of the house’s sale. Like her namesake, Ivy is poisonous, pampering Ellie only to immediately criticise her every move. The atmosphere is claustrophobic, littered with moving boxes as well as unresolved childhood traumas; the decor only enhances this tension with stifling flowery wallpapers a direct contrast to the black gunk oozing from the kitchen sink. Underneath all the prettiness, something is clearly rotting: as Ellie wanders through the corridors of her youth, her repressed memories come flooding back: death, betrayal, unspeakable secrets, darker than any gunk. Reunion is admirably patient: instead of jumpscares, it is more interested in creating an ambience of perverse disquietude: slides of bloody magic rituals, flickering home videos, even brief experimental closeups of internal bodily fluids. These choices initially appear cryptic, but they all come together in the film’s last stretch in a gory, kaleidoscopic spectacle of family trauma. Ormond’sperformance is stunning – she has a magnificent line involving boiling a cauliflower – and there are some truly sublime visual moments. Even if it’s one of those films where the parts are a lot better than the sum, Reunion is sure to linger in the mind. • Reunion is released on 22 March on digital platforms.",Reunion,FILM
172,A Coach’s Daughter review – low-key betrayal on the teen tennis circuit,"Lukasz Grzegorzek’s A Coach’s Daughter is an interestingly downbeat movie, veering away from the big scenes and obvious crises that other films with the same idea might have given you, and yet somehow serving them up in different forms. It’s about the intense and borderline inappropriate relationship between a middle-aged tennis coach, Maciej (Jacek Braciak) and his teenage daughter Wiktoria (Karolina Bruchnicka), who is a budding tennis star. He is driving her all over Poland, where they are competing in summer regional tournaments, and hoping for glory; they share hotel rooms and lounge around together in intimate states of undress like a couple, but appear utterly focused on Wiktoria’s training and fitness. On the road they meet Igor (Bartlomiej Kowalski), a bright young teen male star of this tatty circuit, and Maciej offers to let him tag along and to coach him. Clearly, some sort of emotional betrayal is in the offing, especially as Wiktoria and Igor make a rather handsome couple; there is a real chemistry between them, and Wiktoria could well be sick of this monomaniacal discipline. But Maciej has his own secrets and his own emotional needs. Could it be that it he is going to transfer his passion and quasi-parental concern to Igor, the son he never had, and someone who might actually have a better shot at Wimbledon than Wiktoria? A Hollywood version of the same idea might have had both Igor and Wiktoria each building up to a big match and confronting parallel crises; this isn’t what happens here and it’s notable how Grzegorzek skates over the drama of what happens on court. And a different type of movie might have addressed the audience’s unease about the possibly transgressive relationship of Maciej and Wiktoria, but this film coolly declines to let things go that way. A Coach’s Daughter finds its low-key way of controlling the drama. • A Coach’s Daughter is released on 19 March on YourScreen.",A Coach’s Daughter,FILM
173,While We Are Here review – enigmatic study of romance is hard to love,"Here is a thought-experiment of a movie from Brazilian film-makers Clarissa Campolina and Luiz Pretti: it’s a dramatic essay, or docu-fictional romance, or perhaps the cinematic equivalent of an epistolary novel, and it has been much admired on the festival circuit. But intriguing though its premise is, I couldn’t really make friends with this film. Two characters meet in New York and fall in love, but we never see them (though we maybe glimpse them). We do however hear their voices on the soundtrack, musing and commenting. One is Wilson (Marcela Souza e Silva), a Brazilian migrant worker who is in fact about to return to Brazil due to worrying news from home; the other is Lamis (Mary Ghattas), a Lebanese single mum. What we see is the city around them: ambient streetscapes. But it is not true to say that we see what the characters see, because, in this sense, they never see each other or catch sight of themselves in any mirror. We hear their voices, and also that of a central narrator (Grace Passô), but these voices are strangely unanimated. The actors simply read aloud what are evidently Wilson and Lamis’s thoughts, or possibly journal entries, or emails to each other, which are musing and ruminative. The line-readings are weirdly detached and toneless, and there is a disconcerting absence of passion, or even recognisable emotion in these maundering speeches. Finally, Lamis and her child go to Berlin where she has a scholarship and Wilson goes to Belo Horizonte in south-east Brazil; and Campolina and Pretti capture the street-scenes there as well, in the same way. The ending is as enigmatically emotionless as everything else. There is sincerity here and a formal consistency, but there is something obtuse and thin about it all.

174,Assault on Station 33 review – Nicolas Cage's son dials it up as supervillain,"Although the title invokes John Carpenter’s 1976 classic Assault on Precinct 13, one of the all-time great pulpy siege movies, this tale of a hostage-taking at a Veterans Administration hospital in Buffalo, NY, is all pulp, no greatness. In fact, the premise is not so much about an assault as an infiltration that one fortuitously skilful character, who just happens to be around at the time, accidentally foils when the bad guys threaten his wife and child’s safety. In other words: Die Hard, but with a teensy budget that appears to have mostly been used on a visual effect that makes the many shots of bullets entering bodies look like puffs of red dust exploding like scarlet glitter bombs. It’s quite distracting in its shabbiness. Sean Patrick Flanery stars as Jason Hill, a version of Bruce Willis but with more hair and less comic timing. He’s a former soldier whose wife Jennifer (Gina Holden) works as a therapist treating PTSD patients. While waiting in the hospital building for her to finish treating a high-ranking general (Gerald Webb) while their daughter (Sarah Elizabeth Jensen) waits in the parking lot, Hill notices that some of the workers supposedly there to fix a broken elevator, as well as some unfamiliar security guards, are acting kind of hinky. That’s because they’re all bad guys working for Rabikov (Weston Cage Coppola, son of Nicolas Cage): a Russian terrorist who wants to exchange the general and the lives of the hostages he and his minions capture for his brother, who is being held by the US authorities. Coppola’s year-old-Époisses-ripe performance, sporting a surprisingly convincing Russian accent, is one of the more amusing features of this film which is otherwise a fairly bog-standard opportunity to dish out regular doses of gunfire and fisticuffs. • Assault on Station 33 is released on 15 March on digital platforms.",Assault on Station 33,FILM
175,Nest of Vampires review – a bloodless bid for the title of worst film ever,"There are bad movies, the kind of third-rate film-making we see all the time, and then there are transcendentally bad movies that can only result from deep, fanatical attachment to the material. Director, writer and producer Chris Sanders here achieves something on a par with Ed Wood’s Plan 9 from Outer Space or Tommy Wiseau’s The Room. His Nest of Vampires is a little-England horror-thriller with a plot as over-larded as an Elvis sandwich, uniformly appalling acting, and the same almost beatific earnestness as those two legendary films. MI5 agent Kit Valentine (Tom Fairfoot) leaves his London stamping ground to shake down some unnamed English town for a human trafficking ring that – after his wife is murdered – has abducted his daughter. He needs to get a move on, because the network sells off the girls to moneyed clients to butcher in satanic rituals. Not racy enough? Some of the criminals are also vampires who like a “nibble” on the customers. And Valentine is further up against it when his bosses reveal they are in cahoots. Tied to a chair, though, he has news for them: “You’re not the only secret society that operates within MI5.” Then his own canines turn extra-pointy. For a film so full of brain-freezing exposition, it takes inhuman effort to piece that plot description together. It’s actually a nest of non sequiturs, randomness the only governing principle in a sinkhole of characters, factions, ideas and twists. A prologue refers to lapis lazuli as a means by which vampires can withstand daylight, but this is barely mentioned again. One apparently Italian miscreant – implied to be a vampire, before he isn’t – sounds like the Dolmio Man when he resorts to English: “Good-a point-a!” If criminal networks really were this confusing, the police would have a collective nervous breakdown. Hidden in the aimless scenes and slack direction is the odd nugget of dialogue with a noirish gleam. But mostly it’s pure panto: “I’m about to do a spot of decorating. I was thinking dark red would suit this room.” It may be remiss to dump on a film that cost £30,000, but it seems to be only this type of film-making that can hit a pitch of such sublime pap. Maybe one day Nest of Vampires will get its own Disaster Artist-style eulogy. • Nest of Vampires is released on 16 March on digital platforms.",Nest of Vampires,FILM
176,Silk Road review – high-free account of the dark-web drugs emporium,"Here’s an unthrilling, bland drama about the rise and fall of Ross Ulbricht, the mastermind behind the illegal online drug emporium Silk Road (described by the FBI as “the Amazon of drug sites”). Between 2011 and 2013, PhD dropout Ulbricht made millions of dollars in commissions from users on the dark web anonymously buying and selling drugs. Then he got busted. If you consider how gripping David Fincher made a bunch of geeks in hoodies talking about algorithms look in The Social Network, the Ulbricht story – involving an FBI manhunt and allegations of murder-for-hire – should be a doddle. But watching Silk Road is a bit like rolling a joint only to find the leafy green substance you’ve been sold is oregano. The highs just don’t come. It starts in 2013, with the feds swooping on 29-year-old Ulbricht (an insipid performance from Nick Robinson) at a San Francisco library. In flashback, he emerges as an unlikely Silicon Valley founder. He ticks some of the dotcom boxes (flip-flops, standup desk, rooftop yoga, breathtaking arrogance), but – unusually – he is a rightwinger. The film’s voiceover borrows from blogs he posted on Silk Road spouting his antigovernment libertarian ideals. Director Tiller Russell is clearly team Ulbricht, and a needy tone creeps into the script; it desperately wants us to like Ulbricht, even when he’s plotting to bump off an employee-turned-informant. Meanwhile, Jason Clarke’s role as a drug enforcement officer falls back on stereotypes of knucklehead, bash-down-the-door cops. He plays Rick Bowden, who gets reassigned to cybercrime (after a stint in rehab) to serve out his last nine months on the job behind a desk. But what do you know, his good old-fashioned police work reaches places that detectives with master’s from MIT can’t. “I’ve been locking up bad guys since before you started shaving your balls,” he growls at his boss. Maybe kingpins aren’t what they used to be. Perhaps millennials have taken the excitement out of organised crime. You won’t find much in this movie. • Silk Road is released on 22 March on digital platforms.",Silk Road,FILM
177,Josie & Jack review – shockingly lifeless incest drama,"“Your dad kept you locked up in an old house,” a character drunkenly blurts out in this adaptation of Kelly Braffet’s gothic novel about childhood misery and brother-and-sister incest. “It’s soooo Flowers in the Attic.” If only! The most shocking thing about this movie is how stale and lifeless it is, as if entire scenes had been placed into a vacuum storage bag, zipped up, and sucked of all energy and human feeling. Set in the 1990s, it begins in rural Pennsylvania where 16-year-old Josie (Olivia DeJonge) and her older brother Jack (Alex Neustaedter) have been raised in a spooky old house by their physics professor father (William Fichtner). He’s a violent pompous drunk who homeschools the kids rather than sending them to “the idiot factory” local high school. In a few flatly acted scenes, he rants grandiosely about his university colleagues and hurls crockery at his children. Jack is a good-looking bad boy who instructs Josie to seduce the kid behind the counter of the local pharmacy so he can get his hands on prescription drugs. And Jack creepily paws at his sister, stroking her hair and walking into the bathroom when she’s in the shower. Director Sarah Lancaster’s script, co-written with Braffet, keeps the audience guessing right up to the end how far things have gone between them – but there is so little visible chemistry between the actors you may not care either way. Eventually, after a massive barney at home, the siblings escape, arriving penniless in New York where Jack attaches himself to an Upper West Side socialite, Lily – a brittle performance by Annabelle Dexter-Jones so good it deserves a better role. As for Josie, she is a disappointing non-character – often spotted with her nose in battered Kafka paperback to show she’s got a brain, but 90 minutes pass before she gets a chance to use it. Unintentionally, perhaps, the film is the story of monstrous men (a daddy dictator and controlling brother); the women are weirdly blank. • Josie &amp; Jack is released on 22 March on digital platforms.",Josie & Jack,FILM
178,Film industry celebrities boycott crisis-hit Golden Globes,"Film industry pressure on the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), the body that organises the Golden Globe awards, has increased after more than 100 public relations firms sent a letter telling the organisation they had withdrawn all their celebrity clients from activities with the HFPA until it made “profound and lasting change” to correct what it described as the HFPA’s “longstanding exclusionary ethos … discriminatory behavior [and] ethical impropriety”. According to Variety, the letter, signed by high-profile PR outfits including DDA, Premier, 42West and Rogers &amp; Cowan/PMK, was delivered to the HFPA on Monday, following continuing criticism of the crisis-plagued organisation. The letter reads: “We cannot advocate for our clients to participate in HFPA events or interviews as we await your explicit plans and timeline for transformational change.” “Anything less than transparent, meaningful change that respects and honors the diversity and dignity of our clients, their colleagues and our global audience will result in immediate and irreparable damage to the relationship between our agencies, our clients and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.” The Golden Globes TV broadcast is the HFPA’s most high-profile and lucrative event, and an industry boycott would be devastating. The HFPA’s troubles were sparked by a report in the LA Times shortly before the most recent Golden Globe awards show, in which the HFPA was accused of a lack of diversity in its membership as well as “ethical lapses” in the way it conducted its business. The organisation’s response, in which it said it would add “Black and other underrepresented professionals to [the] organisation” and improve “transparency” over its voting and membership processes, was deemed inadequate by high-profile film industry campaign group Time’s Up. The HFPA responded to the publicists’ letter with a statement in which it acknowledged it “should have done more, and sooner”, and said it would ensure that “at least 13 per cent of the membership be Black journalists” by the end of the year.",Film industry,OTHERS
179,The Legend of the Stardust Brothers review – 80s Japanese bubblegum pop curio,"A curio that’s lain dormant for many years since it first sashayed on to screens in 1985, this Japanese teeny-bop musical supports the argument that not all cult films need to be revived. Ultimately, some were flops the first time round for good reason. That said, lovers of Asian kawaii culture, camp and Japanese bubblegum pop, which all converge in this confection, are likely to be satisfied. Like so many of pop-tastic exploitation projects (see also the Monkees’ Head), the music comes first and the story splicing it all together a distant second. Musician-impresario Haruo Chikada composed the soundtrack of cheesy, synth-heavy bop and then hired director Makoto Tezuka (son of the famous manga artist Osamu Tezuka, creator of Astro Boy) to string the songs together into a script. Et voila, the confection they came up with this is a self-referential tale of two aspiring pop stars: temperamentally scratchy Shingo (Shingo Kubota) and cooler, albeit mulleted, pretty-boy Kan (Kan Takagi), who are brought together by a record company executive in order to create a commercially compelling duo. Marimo, a random girl they meet at the label’s headquarters, is drafted in to become the head of their fan club, before they even have much of a fan club to start. The songs, a glorious mishmash of genres ranging from sub-Joy Division post-punk to ska beats to moody new wave drones, are fitfully entertaining (with their poorly translated lyrics about topics including maxed-out credit cards, tomato juice and artistic ambition). But it’s all so clumsily assembled and herky-jerky, it gets more irritating than amusing over the long haul. The best bits are where it totally goes off into crazy-town with zombie monsters played by actors in latex masks and then back to (relative) reality as if nothing has happened. • The Legend of the Stardust Brothers is released on 18 March on Mubi.",The Legend of the Stardust Brothers,FILM
180,Slaxx review – killer jeans horror-satire,"The spirit of Roger Corman’s original Little Shop of Horrors lives again in this entirely ridiculous but often amusing and sharp horror-satire from Canadian film-maker Elza Kephart, set in an unbearably cool clothes shop, in which the sales assistants cruise around talking to each other with mic-headsets, but hardly deign to communicate with the customers. Romaine Denis plays Libby, a starry-eyed young woman who is thrilled to have got a job at this store, awed by its visionary CEO and by the company’s commitment to non-exploitative practices and its ethical attitude to the developing-world communities where the clothes are made and where the cotton is grown. But of course it is all nonsense. The company cuts costs with sweatshop contractors in south Asia, and the super-cool jeans that it is bringing in for its new line are in fact haunted by the vengeful spirits of those workers in India who have been injured and killed. And so, for the special evening in which these new garments are to be unveiled at the store to an elite of hipsters and Instagram influencers, the jeans themselves run amok in a bloody orgy of revenge against the first-world fashionistas. It is all very silly, and some of the script and acting are a bit broad (though perfectly consistent with the overall style). The scenes where the jeans come to life like malign reptiles and even start dancing on the shop floor are good; some videos over the closing credits cheerfully reveal the tech wizardry that created these effects. An entertaining skewering of the hidden global politics in retail trendiness. • Slaxx is released on 18 March on Shudder.",The Legend of the Stardust Brothers,FILM
181,Preparations to Be Together for an Unknown Period of Time review – Blow-Up in Budapest,"Here is a puzzle or a riddle of a psychological movie, with distant echoes of Roeg’s Bad Timing or Antonioni’s Blow-Up. A brilliant and beautiful Hungarian neurosurgeon, Márta (Natasa Stork), abandons her career in the United States just shy of her 40th birthday and returns to Budapest. And why? Because she has met a handsome compatriot at an academic conference: János (Viktor Bodó) is a fellow surgeon who romantically arranged to meet Márta at a certain time and date at the city’s Liberty Bridge. But János doesn’t show up, and when Márta tracks him down and confronts him, he merely says with an air of baffled politeness that they have never met. Márta takes a job in Budapest and rents a certain scuzzy apartment because it has a view of the now totemic, or cursed, bridge and begins to stalk János online, even uncovering a video of him as a child winning a singing competition with an arrangement of Schubert’s Trout Quintet. But her career still prospers, with brilliant diagnoses and masterly surgeries, which intrigue János. So what is going on? Is János lying? Is Márta delusional? Or is this her kind of obsession-based “magical thinking” – has Márta imagined what she wants in the future, and made an unconscious decision to behave as if it is the case, forcing the facts to rearrange themselves around her wishes, like iron filings around a magnet? The paradox of the film’s narrative procedure is that it is shown from her point of view, not János’s, and yet it is Márta’s account that the audience is tacitly invited to challenge. The movie can’t quite match the drama – and the shock – of János’s denial of Márta at the very beginning, and the ending ties things up a little neatly. It is at once a relief and an obscure disappointment that the mystery is not left enigmatically unsolved. • Preparations to Be Together for an Unknown Period of Time is released on 19 March on Curzon Home Cinema.",Preparations to Be Together for an Unknown Period of Time,FILM
182,Killing Escobar review – the hard men behind  plot to kill drug lord,"Here’s a documentary that shines a light on squalid corner of British post-imperial legacy: the batches of mercenaries – largely former military personnel – who roamed the world’s trouble spots in the 70s and 80s, killing for hire in numerous civil conflicts in Africa and Latin America. (As this film suggests, these ex-SAS types weren’t politically neutral: they were actively keen on killing communists in places like Angola and Rhodesia.) The film focuses on an escapade that is – ethically speaking – a little less murky than cold war Africa: a plot to assassinate the super-powerful Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar in the late 1980s. However, since it was organised at the behest of another super-powerful Colombian drug lord, any claims to the moral high ground are not really supportable. The principal interviewees here are Peter McAleese, a former paratrooper who grew up in Glasgow and was responsible for the military activities of the assassination squad, and the somewhat more dapper David Tomkins, the man who organised the contracts and who by his own account moved enormous amounts of arms into conflict zones. McAleese and Tomkins relate the story of their mission efficiently enough. We know it is doomed to fail, as history tells us Escobar was shot dead a few years later, in 1993, by a Colombian police unit. Presumably to crank up the narrative tension, director David Whitney adds a series of reconstruction-flashback scenes of McAleese, alone and injured in the Colombian rainforest. With little signposting, they slow down the film’s momentum, even if we eventually learn where they fit in in the bigger scheme of things. It all seems rather affable until a shipment of weapons turns up: the gun lust on show underscores the abhorrent nature of the enterprise. Rather like a veteran ex-football hooligan, McAleese is heroically frank about his propensity for violence as he fills in his backstory, offering up as evidence his rough Glaswegian upbringing next door to Barlinnie prison (he points out the cell window from which his hardman father would signal when he was doing time). On some level, McAleese’s scorn for his former self is a reasonably creditable attempt to confront the consequences of the destruction he has caused, even if there is an evasiveness about the way he focuses on failings in his personal life rather than his victims, in Africa or elsewhere. At 79, he’s still a scary individual. • Killing Escobar is out now on digital platforms.",Killing Escobar,FILM
183,Russian Raid review – hostile takeover of screens in steroidal martial arts actioner,"Russia’s hooligan set will have a new Friday-night post-pub favourite with this martial arts film, modelled on Gareth Evans’s The Raid. In a literal hostile takeover, former Spetsnaz sniper Nikita (Ivan Kotik) leads a squad of tracksuited casuals into a vodka factory/mafia front on behalf of a shady businessmen (Ilya Antonenko) looking to seize it – but he also has a personal beef with the owner. For reasons half-explained, the squad are forbidden from carrying guns, and the chief heavy (played by real-life MMA fighter Vladimir Mineev) chafes against Nikita’s command from the off. They work their way up through the factory’s security to the C-suite, with much fisticuffs, mostly in the fashionable MMA style – with heavy emphasis on grappling and backhanded slaps that look prissy but probably aren’t. The standout is a corridor-hemmed brawl against three juggernauts wielding a host of medieval weaponry, with director Denis Kryuchkov often keeping us locked in with the combatants with swaying, reeling Steadicam. But introducing firearms halfway through, when the factory’s true owners enter the fray, works to somehow lower the stakes. As more parties become involved, the already poorly defined relationships between the characters become get more confusing – including what white-suited secretary (Sofya Ozerova) is doing there other than providing openings for misogynistic jeopardy. (She’s given an empowering assault rifle later.) The initial tone of impish mayhem shifts into something grim and rote, ill-serving frontman Kotik. Interestingly lithe, aloof and not overly macho, he has obvious star chops – breaking out in some fights into footwork drawn from the Russian folk dancing he does in one childhood flashback. “Balletic” used to be the adjective of choice for John Woo’s action films, and Kotik is clearly primed to deliver this in material that is more than this steroid party. • Russian Raid is released on 22 March on digital platforms.",Russian Raid,FILM
184,Amber and Me review – a moving portrait of a girl with Down’s syndrome,"Here is a humane and undeniably moving documentary about Amber Davies, a girl with Down’s syndrome, filmed over four years as she enters and moves up the school system. An hour in length, and released to coincide with World Down Syndrome Day, it examines her progress through three linked but separate perspectives, bringing together moments of beauty and joy as well as the harsher realities that not even childhood can escape. Olivia, Amber’s neurotypical twin, is a constant presence, showing great maturity, helping her sister with daily tasks and taking time to understand her. We also hear directly from her via voiceover; she doesn’t hide how she feels when she believes her sister has been unjustly treated, and articulates her hopes that Amber will be able to stay in the same school as her. The second perspective belongs to Ian Davies, Amber’s father and the film’s director. A largely off-screen presence, Davies is clearly a loving and encouraging father; it would have been interesting to hear directly from him. But the repeated scenes in which Davies visits his daughter’s play-shop are a nice touch, establishing atmosphere where we can observe Amber’s development for ourselves. Amber’s perspective, of course, takes centre stage, a valuable corrective to the current mire of neurodivergent-as-plot-device in mainstream cinema. The film reminds us that Amber is a fully realised individual, with interests and feelings to explore: she wall-climbs with her father, bakes with her sister and demonstrates an emotional complexity that most media would not appreciate. As the film progresses, we can only root for Amber, happy for her advances and feeling her pain when things stall. A labour of love in the most accurate sense. Amber and Me is released on 21 March on digital platforms.",Amber and Me,FILM
185,Creation Stories review – generic biopic of record label supremo Alan McGee,"“Bottom line, it was fun,” says self-declared Glaswegian ginger bastard Alan McGee (Ewen Bremner). Poolside in LA, the music executive reflects on his label, Creation Records, which ran from 1983 to 1999 and produced acts including the Jesus and Mary Chain, Primal Scream and Oasis. Suki Waterhouse plays a journalist profiling McGee, a framing device that should, in theory, allow the film to rollick through his formative moments and skip over any boring bits. It’s not unfun, exactly, to watch McGee going on an ill-advised coke bender with a sleazy film producer played by Jason Isaacs, ingratiating himself with Tony Blair (James Payton) and taking advice from an occultist (Steven Berkoff) he hallucinates at a house party. Yet the frenetic pacing, intended to sweep the audience along, can’t draw attention away from Irvine Welsh and Dean Cavanagh’s platitude-riddled script. Their key message, to “be a rebel, always”, as underscored in a Trainspotting-lite speech that closes out the film, feels oddly generic.",Creation Stories,FILM
186,Oleg review – the tale of a Latvian trapped in Belgium,"There’s a welcome streak of black comedy running through Latvian director Juris Kursietis’s second feature, which follows a young Latvian immigrant as he struggles to establish a new life in Belgium. In many ways, Oleg’s (Valentin Novopolskij) situation is sobering. He is unfairly dismissed from his job at a meat-processing plant after a colleague loses a finger. His living situation is precarious and at the mercy of villainous Polish landlord and mafioso Andrzej (Dawid Ogrodnik). And despite a new gig as a roofer, he can’t seem to get paid. A day trip to Ghent to visit Hubert and Jan Van Eyck’s altarpiece, The Adoration of the Mystic Lamb, finds Oleg haunted by his grandmother’s insistence that its sacrificial lamb is hopeful, not sad. The film refuses to get bogged down in the bleakness of Oleg’s predicament, with Kursietis’s irrepressibly lively handheld camera emphasising his protagonist’s sense of perpetual forward motion. Ogrodnik’s performance as landlord Andrzej, a charismatic smooth-talker who seduces Oleg with promises of Fifa matches and free food in a kind of frat house for migrants, lightens things too. In one scene he teaches Oleg to fire a gun in the woods. “You are ready now,” he declares, as a terrified Oleg misses his mark, the bullet just skimming his shoe. • On Mubi from 23 March",Oleg,FILM
187,Banksy Most Wanted review – adulatory greatest-hits profile of the graffiti kingpin,"Here is a watchable, if slaveringly adulatory documentary profile of the yet-to-be-conclusively-identified artist, whose increasingly pricey work has spawned its own mini-industry of blokes with angle grinders chopping stencils off walls and doors almost before the paint is dry. Directed by Seamus Haley and Aurélia Rouvier, this film covers most of the bases: beginning with the 2018 shredding of his Girl With Balloon painting shortly after it had sold at auction, and working back through earlier greatest hits such as the Dismaland theme park, the Walled Off hotel in Bethlehem in the West Bank, and the Mobile Lovers gift to a Bristol youth club. It also very much bends the knee, allowing statements such as “Banksy is the Picasso of the 21st century” to pass through unchallenged; others may not subscribe entirely to this point of view. In lieu of much biographical information, quite a lot of the film is given over to entertaining speculation on Banksy’s identity: Massive Attack’s Robert del Naja, Tank Girl/Gorillaz illustrator Jamie Hewlett, and someone called Robin Gunningham, are all put forward as plausible candidates. (At one point a serial killer investigator gets involved; the vagueness of his conclusions doesn’t bode well for the state of the US justice system.) The backstroking and raptures do get a bit much, but the counterweight is provided by arguably the most interesting talking head: art dealer Robin Barton, who unembarrassedly talks about how he (legally) removed a number of artworks with the help of said angle-grinders – but met his Waterloo when wall-ownership issues scuppered the “preservation” of a stencil cut out from the side of an amusement arcade in Folkestone. (Though I am not quite sure how one commentator can stand up the idea that the picture was owned “emotionally” by Folkestone’s local population.) Well, even if you don’t sign up to Banksy’s genius, it’s fair to say he’s harnessed social media like no other artist, using it to authenticate his work, preserve his anonymity, and document his stunts – all of which has helped to inflate the monetary and cultural value of his output. And if Banksy wants to be the Keyser Soze of contemporary art, that’s his affair. It certainly sells tickets. • Banksy Most Wanted is released on 22 March on digital platforms.",Banksy Most Wanted,FILM
188,Shortcut review – five go on a gory getaway,"Shot in Italy, with an English cast, there’s a crisp, almost fairytale levity to Alessio Liguori’s horror adventure that sits oddly but not unworkably with its gorier elements. It’s not quite clear exactly where it is set: perhaps actually in Italy, as the group of five youngsters being escorted on a red vintage bus are from an international school. Bantering with their driver, the party are jumped by a gun-toting convict when they stop to clear a dead deer off the road. But when the bus halts in a tunnel, with a shrouded shape huddled in front of them on the tarmac, they realise there’s worse out there. Liguori and writer Daniele Cosci don’t do much more than establish the character types of this Breakfast Club of teenagers: normals Nolan and Bess, swotty Queenie, joker Karl and bad boy Reggie. Not getting bogged down in interpersonal relationships means giving freer rein to the basic claustrophobia of their predicament, as their vehicle is menaced by a bulbous-headed beastie that looks a bit like William Blake’s Ghost of a Flea on crack. But Shortcut is not really tense: there’s a presiding zaniness that is almost cartoonish, with Zander Emlano’s Karl – whose lazy charm makes him the standout performer – especially game for screaming straight to camera. It’s one “yikes” away from being Scooby-Doo. Despite a rush of backstory when the gang hunker down in an abandoned fort and discover a cache of newspaper cuttings, the storytelling is a bit too scant and the runaround with the monster a bit too silly. But, delicately shooting all three environments – woods, bus and underground tunnels – with skin-prickling intensity, Shortcut retains a fresh edge. There is still the question of who the film is for: the close encounters with the pucker-mouthed parasite are too intense for kids. Maybe precocious tweens, or adults who are still afraid of the dark. • Shortcut is released on 29 March on digital platforms.",Shortcut,FILM
189,That Cloud Never Left review – experimental ruminations on cinema and labour,"An artful hybrid of documentary and fiction, That Cloud Never Left zooms in on quotidian life in Daspara, a small West Bengal village where toys are made from reels of discarded film footage. The iconography is clear: these pieces of film are filled with nostalgia and longing, and now bear witness to the beauty and toil of manual labour. On the surface, That Cloud Never Left appears structurally fragmented, even opaque. There is an opening title that states that this is a work of fiction rather than a documentary; it is actually quite cheeky, considering that narrative is not a priority here, nor are any professional actors used. Instead, the film ditches linearity, and sees the villagers in fragments: a marital dispute over finances, a mother who waits for the monsoon, a boy searching for rubies in the forest. This mix of mundane life and magical daydreams lends an otherworldliness to this little village, as if the content of the cut-up film strips has seeped into everyday life. In visual terms, That Cloud Never Left is just as eclectic and experimental, alternating between straightforward scenes of toy-assembly with scans of the discarded strips where the images are scratched and intelligible. The sound mix contributes, too: the landscape murmurs, a static-heavy score disrupts, and the news on TV speaks of war and unrest, as well as an imminent eclipse. Out of the blue, dialogue and songs from old Hindi films sneak in. The symphony of these elements is exhilarating enough, but there’s more to be mined. The scrap film footage travels from wealthier Indian cities to be dumped on poor villages such as Daspara for recycling, meaning That Cloud Never Left becomes something more than a stylistic exercise in experimentation and nostalgia; there’s a hard economic reality here. • That Cloud Never Left is released on 26 March on True Story.",That Cloud Never Left,FILM
190,The Drifters review – grating post-Brexit romantic drama,"Here is a French New Wave pastiche that, like many others, emulates the style but retains none of the charm. The Drifters tries hard to blend the aesthetics of those 1960s classics with pressing issues of migration and racism. Alas, the poorly sketched characters render the film’s social concerns superficial at best and tone-deaf at worst. The Drifters follows a whirlwind romance between Fanny (Lucie Bourdeu), a French waitress, and Kofi (Jonathan Ajayi), an undocumented Senegalese migrant. After a meet-cute in an English class in London, Kofi sweeps Fanny away on a half romantic, half literal getaway trip to the seaside. Kofi has committed a robbery in exchange for an Irish passport – a better option than a British one in a post-Brexit world – and he is now on the run from both his boss Doog (Joey Akubeze) and the police. Like many Nouvelle Vague heroines, Fanny loves addressing the camera and breaking into dance. Unfortunately, such behavioural quirks swiftly become insufferable: she turns to the audience to muse on how she eats a lot but stays thin, and how commercials used to be so much better because of all the sex and violence. The Drifters is clearly clueless about the delicate dynamics of interracial romance: Fanny’s “cute” jokes with Kofi, which include asking if he has explosives in his bag and a “black people don’t swim” tease are downright mind-boggling. Even worse, the film has included a reprehensible trope in which Kofi befriends and redeems a white man (played by Jonjo O’Neill) who hurls racist abuse at him. In the end, Ajayi is The Drifters’ only saving grace; his heartfelt, sincere performance is the single beacon of substance in a stylish but hollow work. • The Drifters is released on 12 March on YourScreen.",The Drifters,FILM
191,Black Widow headed to Disney+ as studio shakes up schedule,"Disney has announced that Black Widow and Cruella will both be debuting on its streaming service Disney+ at the same time as in cinemas. The Marvel adventure and 101 Dalmatians prequel had both been intended for traditional theatrical releases but with the box office still underperforming, the studio has made the decision for a hybrid release. “Today’s announcement reflects our focus on providing consumer choice and serving the evolving preferences of audiences,” said Kareem Daniel, chairman of Disney’s media and entertainment distribution. Both films will be part of the platform’s premier access service, which requires users to pay an additional $30 rental fee, the same model used for Mulan and, most recently, Raya and the Last Dragon, which some US exhibitors have refused to show because of the simultaneous release. Box office intake has slowly started to increase in the US, with cinemas reopening in New York City and Los Angeles, the two biggest markets in the country, but many national locations still remain closed and capacity limits mean that attendance remains low. The studio has also announced that Pixar’s summer film Luca will eschew any form of theatrical release in territories with Disney+, headed straight to the platform for no additional cost. The same strategy was used in December for Soul. Other films moved back by the company include Marvel’s Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, now opening in September, and the Agatha Christie adaptation Death on the Nile, now being released in February 2022. Cruella, starring Emma Stone as the titular villain, will be released on 28 May while Black Widow is scheduled to premiere on 9 July. The Scarlett Johansson adventure was initially scheduled for 1 May 2020 but has seen a number of shifts because of Covid-19. The news comes after Disney claimed its latest Marvel series, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, was its most watched Disney+ series premiere yet, beating The Mandalorian and WandaVision. The studio recently reported that the platform has over 100 million users in just 16 months of operation.",Black Widow,FILM
192,Take Back review –  dusty martial arts thriller looks cramped,"Clearly intended as a leg-up in the ranks of the female action star for Gillian White, this smalltown revenge thriller starts off well but takes a fatally long time to gather momentum. White plays Zara, a successful lawyer in a desert town whose martial arts skills, courtesy of lethal-but-sensitive husband and dojo partner Brian (Michael Jai White, her real-life husband/trainer), make her a social media hit after she disarms a goon threatening a coffee-shop assistant. This lowlife is in fact part of a local human-trafficking ring, masterminded by chihuahua-loving hoodlum Patrick (Mickey Rourke), with links to Zara’s secret past. Any B-movie thriller worth its salt should get to its inciting incident within the first 20 minutes. Here, it’s the kidnapping of Zara and Brian’s daughter, and it takes nearly 50 minutes to arrive. The plot is jammed instead with portentous run-ins with Patrick’s thugs, leaden teasing-out of Zara’s history that hovers close to matinee melodrama, and only the sporadic justice-servings we are really here for. With a fierce crochet hook of a left eyebrow, White has a natural charisma and authority, and – with him indoors taking a back seat – ample room to strut them. Yet director Christian Sesma shoots her in a cramped way that prevents full butt-kicking glory, and she starts to become strangely decentred in her own film. Elsewhere, despite looking these days like a man trapped inside Mickey Rourke prosthetic makeup, Rourke has a rueful dignity in his few, largely static scenes that is hard to take your eyes off. • Take Back is released on 29 March on digital platforms.",Take Back,FILM
193,Honeydew review – flame-grilled rural horror,"A first feature from director of short films Devereux Milburn, co-written by Milburn and the film’s cinematographer-producer Dan Kennedy, this is a stylised, unsettling horror jaunt that plays interesting variations on an all-too-familiar plot premise. Sam and Riley, a good-looking couple in their 20s, played respectively by Sawyer Spielberg (yes, son of Steven Spielberg) and Malin Barr, takes the always foolish decision to leave the safety of the city for a camping trip. In this case, they elect to pitch their tent somewhere in rural New England because Riley is working on a doctoral thesis about a (fictitious) fungal infection in wheat that causes gangrene and madness in cows and people. However, they soon get run off their campsite by the local farmer (Stephen D’Ambrose), and a flat car battery forces them to seek help at the cluttered homestead of elderly Karen (Barbara Kingsley), a keen baker and cooker of meaty steaks, and her mute, brain-damaged son (Jamie Bradley). The city slickers soon find themselves at the mercy of ravenous desires; but on the plus side, all the TV sets seem to be perpetually tuned to the last station in the world showing nothing but old black and white Popeye and Betty Boop cartoons from the Inkwell Studios’ heyday in the early 1930s, a glorious period in animation, and a good match for the body horror that’s about to be revealed here. With a running time of 107 minutes, the film goes on just a little longer than it really needs to before it gets predictably violent, grotesque and reasonably scary at last. But Milburn and Kennedy certainly know how to build a unique atmosphere, using liverish lighting schemes, cantered camera angles, unsettling split screens, misleading editing and above all a truly disturbing soundtrack that combines source noise with composer John Mehrmann’s musical score – a mix of synthesizers, unsettling percussive bongs and bubble pops, and what sounds like a theremin having a very bad day. • Honeydew is released on 29 March on digital platforms.",Honeydew,FILM
194,Stray review – exquisite dog's eye view of Istanbul,"At last, just what world cinema really needs right now: an exquisitely made film about street dogs in Istanbul, satiating that universal desire to see distant lands, coo over beautiful, noble animals, and satisfy the audience’s need to feel guilty about the misfortune of poorer, unluckier people. Director Elizabeth Lo’s first feature-length documentary ticks every box, while also providing a companion piece to Kedi, Ceyda Torun’s equally wonderful ode to Istanbul and Turkey’s feral felines. Together, the two films would make the perfect night in of viewing for quarantined animal lovers with frustrated wanderlust, especially anyone who loves the magnificently grotty Bosphorus metropolis. Filmed seemingly with a low-slung camera held for great chunks of the running time at dog-head height, the film follows a gaggle of orphans both canine and human whose paths intersect and converge. A trio of Turkish-speaking refugees from Syria live in squatted building sites and doorways, and the camera stands back and watches while they huff glue from bags and space out. The actual protagonist is a yellow mutt named Zeytin, a Labra-something cross probably, with the most soulful eyes you’ll see in any movie this year. Dragging a slightly crook leg and sometimes palling up with dog friend Nazar – a dark, stockier lady of a certain age – Zeytin hangs with the Syrian boys and then saunters off to look for food when the fancy takes her, queen of the road, blithely unconcerned about cars. The spliced-in grandiloquent quotes about dogs and philosophy and whatnot from Diogenes that pepper the film aren’t really necessary; the action speaks for itself. Perhaps because the star species here is more biddable and less camera-shy than the average cat, Lo’s film stays closer to its non-human heroine than Kedi did, creating a more lyrical, less anthropological study. That poetic vibe is richly enhanced by composer Ali Helnwein’s keening, cello-centric score that’s nimbly synched up to the editing. That said, nothing tops the vocal performance from Zeytin herself at the end, howling hauntingly along with a muezzin’s call to prayer. • Stray is released on 26 March on digital platforms.",Stray,FILM
195,Oleg review – migrant drama of despair leaves no way out,"Here is the second feature from Juris Kursietis, a Latvian film-maker working in a toughly questioning European social-realist style. Valentin Novopolskij plays Oleg, a young migrant worker from Riga working in a meat processing plant in Ghent, Belgium. A grisly accident means that he is danger of losing the job and getting deported, but poor, biddable Oleg falls under the sway of a sinister Polish gangmaster called Andrzej, who genially offers to get him a fake Polish passport and fix him up with cash-in-hand building work with all the other eastern European illegals . They are all living together, drinking and playing Fifa in a house that they are supposed to be remodelling – but the mercurial and voluble Andrzej is in fact terrorising them like an abusive stepfather and using them in violent crime. Andrzej is played by Dawid Ogrodnik, whom I last saw as the sax-playing hitchhiker in Paweł Pawlikowski’s Ida. This is a bleakly uncompromising film, shot in a handheld manner, the camera shakily following Oleg closely around in the streets, the building sites and the various chaotic and squalid interiors. But it’s leavened with a kind of black comedy: Oleg ends up having sex with a young woman during a somewhat unlikely interlude, by conning his way into a private party and pretending to be an actor, and the realism is interspersed with dream-like and religiose sequences. Interestingly, movies like this about the marginal, the exploited and the dispossessed usually have a young woman at their heart rather than a man, and this shows how there is a very masculine sort of humiliation and despair in Oleg’s heart. He has a connection with Andrzej’s abused girlfriend, Małgosia (Anna Próchniak), and it is easy to see how Oleg’s life is playing out in a kind of gender-switch parallel to hers. I’m not sure I quite believed the way in which this story is played out, but there is an abrasive energy to it. • Oleg is released on 23 March on Mubi.",Oleg,FILM
196,Violation review – a torrent of suppressed rage,"In Violation’s closing stretch, Miriam (Madeleine Sims-Fewer) sits numbly in a rain-lashed car and watches a man harangue his wife in an eastern European language. Miriam has just done something unspeakable, in reaction to something unforgivable; preparing to finish the job at an anonymous motel, it is as if she has crossed a border into a foreign country. But the couple in front of her show the inescapable constant: male violence. Building to a remorseless climax, Sims-Fewer and co-writer/director Dusty Mancinelli brilliantly, and times almost unwatchably, overhaul the rape-revenge movie as something far more realistic, traumatised and noxious. Miriam has come from London to visit her sister Greta (Anna Maguire) in the Canadian forest idyll she shares with husband Dylan (Jesse LaVercombe). But tension is in the air: in Miriam’s faltering marriage with Caleb (Obi Abili), in her jealousy of her sister, even in the disturbing flashes of nature – pond lice seething on the lake – that open the film. Able only to unburden herself to the seemingly matey Dylan, Miriam stupidly kisses him by the campfire; then when she is sleeping, he rapes her. Sims-Fewer and Mancinelli don’t show this event immediately, opting for non-linear disorientation that cuts between that night and a later hook-up in a log cabin in which Miriam ties Dylan naked to a chair, and asks for his side of the story. What follows is possibly the most brutal woman-on-man ordeal since Audition. But there is nothing triumphal about it; this isn’t some fantasy spree, just a single abject act of reprisal. The violence, and the torrent of suppressed rage and disgust it unleashes, are appalling. When the rape is finally shown, it is in tiny glimpses of chilled napes and heaving eyelids. Trying to utterly destroy Dylan’s body is Miriam’s response to the invasion of her own, and this corporeal tragedy plays out in Sims-Fewer’s staggering physical commitment to the role. Outside the motel, her face becomes a glistening mask; a fury in the classical Greek sense. Misogyny remains current, but this stony rejoinder – with nature shot as if out of kilter, or possibly amplified – feels like something from the ancient world. • Violation is released on 25 March on Shudder.",Violation,FILM
197,Nemesis review – geezer cliche compilation with a charisma bypass,"If Towie put out a crime special it might look a bit like this shoddy London thriller about an ageing gangster whose plans for a peaceful retirement go south. The characters have that same style of stiff, awkward delivery, as if they’re speaking lines to each other over a dodgy Zoom link. The star is TV mainstay Billy Murray (The Bill and EastEnders) who plays John Morgan, a gang boss with the telltale mahogany suntan of a cockney hardman done good. Morgan, semi-retired in Turkey, flies into London on a private jet for a charity fundraiser. But on the night there’s a spot of bovver with an old foe, alcoholic detective Frank Conway (Nick Moran). Morgan and his wife Sadie (Jeanine Nerissa Sothcott) have also arranged a dinner to meet their Instagram influencer daughter’s new girlfriend – and there’s a horrifically sleazy scene when the girlfriend arrives early to find Sadie wearing only knickers. Murray plays villain Morgan with the menace of a bag of spinach wilting soggily at the back of the fridge – it’s almost as if his contract has stipulated a charisma bypass is a condition for the part. And everything is let down by the script, which feels cobbled together from geezerish cliches. “You’re like a British bulldog,” an associate growls at Morgan. “You’re proud, defiant, tenacious, old-school. But there comes a time in every animal’s life when it needs to be put down.” In the third act, the family dinner party turns into a home invasion nightmare that is an ordeal for all the wrong reasons. Meanwhile, copper Conway is downing whiskies in a gentrified East End boozer, getting all riled up for revenge. A twist at the end of the meal is ludicrous. In cockney rhyming slang, this is pony and trap. • Nemesis is released on 29 March on digital platforms.",Nemesis,FILM
198,The Banishing review – Jessica Brown Findlay shines in standard spooker,"“An empire of misogyny” is how former Irish president Mary McAleese described the Catholic church – and Christianity as a historical perpetrator of sexism and violence against women adds an interesting-ish layer or two to this otherwise run-of-the-mill but well-acted haunted-house horror. It’s set in the runup to the second world war and loosely inspired by Borley Rectory, the country manor once dubbed “the most haunted house in England”. Downton Abbey’s Jessica Brown Findlay is terrific as Marianne, a vicar’s wife with a rebellious streak (her bohemian “loose woman” past becomes crucial later). Marianne has just moved into a crumbling pile in the Essex countryside with her wet blanket husband Linus (John Heffernan) and their young daughter Adelaide (Anya McKenna-Bruce). The local bishop Malachi (John Lynch), a man who wears the huge gold cross around his neck like gangster’s bling, is clearly not to be trusted. And pretty soon things are going clank in the night. The film’s scares feel pretty standard, with nothing new to add to the gothic haunted house canon. Marianne hears voices wailing in the walls; her daughter finds a creepy Victorian doll with gaping black holes where its eyes have been gouged out. Nevertheless, director Christopher Smith turns the screws with malevolent precision: scenes in which Marianne and little Adelaide see their doppelgangers reflected in a mirror are genuinely unnerving, as are Marianne’s violent hallucinations. It all gets very silly, and there’s a naff go-nowhere storyline involving Nazis. But Brown Findlay holds it together with her performance of Marianne as the sort of woman who marches no-nonsense into the dark basement brandishing a torch to take on the ghosts of mad monks. • The Banishing is released on 26 March on digital platforms.",The Banishing,FILM
199,Feedback review – Eddie Marsan thriller on the wrong frequency,"This contrived, nasty and uninteresting horror-thriller is a waste of its star Eddie Marsan. He plays Jarvis Dolan, a late-night radio presenter of lefty views, sort of like James O’Brien, with a bit of Piers Morgan’s provocation. His career is in crisis, having only just survived a kidnapping from a shadowy group of Brexity rightwing extremists. The station’s oleaginous boss Norman (a cameo from Anthony Head) insists that Jarvis now lightens the broadcasting mood by getting reunited with his old double-act partner, Andrew Wilde (played by Peaky Blinders’ Paul Anderson), a boozy, jokey wild man that Jarvis can’t stand these days. But hardly have they got together for their first show than they are attacked by terrifying masked individuals who lock them in the studio, forcing them to stay on the air, because they are obsessed with a certain something in Jarvis and Andrew’s past. All the buildup turns out to be tiringly irrelevant to the attack itself, which revolves around an event from 10 years ago, in circumstances that don’t seem at all convincing for people who are supposed to be late-night radio presenters, not rock stars. The movie is supposed to deliver claustrophobic tension and thrills, a little like Assault on Precinct 13, perhaps. But there is a weird lack of plausible plot involvement, and also a disconcerting amount of implausible plot development. Who would have thought that a radio studio actually had a sort of trapdoor in the side leading to possible escape from the building? And then there are flourishes of horrible violence that don’t mesh with the rest of the film. You might find yourself tuning out. • Feedback is released on 26 March on digital platforms.",Feedback,FILM
200,Six Minutes to Midnight review – Eddie Izzard miscast in strained Nazi-school yarn,"Eddie Izzard, comedy genius and heroic campaigner for the European cause, is bizarrely miscast in a deadpan-serious acting role for this weird, strained, second world war spy melodrama inspired by a stranger-than-fiction true story. The transgender star switches back here to what Izzard has playfully called “boy mode” for a boy’s-own-story in the style of John Buchan or Erskine Childers, or maybe one of Michael Palin’s Ripping Yarns, though with the jokes and comic self-awareness systematically removed. It’s a muddled, unrelaxed tale from Izzard as co-writer and co-producer, whose dramatic gears keep slipping, and which is never entirely sure where our sympathies should lie. Izzard plays Thomas Miller, a teacher of Anglo-German ancestry who in the fraught summer of 1939 takes a job at the Augusta Victoria college in Bexhill-on-Sea, a kind of genteel finishing school for expatriate German adolescent girls; he is interviewed for the job by the naively pro-German English headmistress Miss Rocholl (with Judi Dench sleepwalking through the role). This extraordinary school really did exist throughout the 1930s, with a swastika discreetly sewn into its crest next to the union jack, and it was attended by the daughters and god-daughters of some very senior Nazis. Izzard imagines what might happen if, as war loomed, this place was the centre of a Nazi intelligence plot. A lively idea for a drama, but the sheer oddity of the real-life premise slows it down, and the film is unsure about whether we should see these teen blonde Mädchen pupils as Midwich-Cuckoo mini-Nazis or as poignant dupes. A spy story depends on secrecy and concealment, but this school is entirely open about its pro-German and pro-Nazi leanings from the outset. As for the character of Miller, he is supposed to be a real action hero, and there are loads of shots of Izzard running athletically and surreally away from the camera across open fields. The film itself runs out of breath. • Six Minutes to Midnight is released on 26 March on Sky Cinema.",Six Minutes to Midnight,FILM
201,Memories of My Father review – deeply felt memoir of Medellín's public-health champion,"Javier Cámara is the Spanish actor with the gentle, open, everyman face who has been a stalwart repertory player for Pedro Almodóvar for around 20 years, particularly in the mysterious and beautiful 2002 film Talk to Her; Cámara unforgettably played Benigno, the nurse tending to a young woman in a coma, believing that he must always talk to her. Now he gives a wonderful richness and warmth to this very affecting movie, directed by Fernando Trueba; it is based on the true story of Héctor Abad Gómez, the Colombian public-health activist and prominent government critic who in 1987 was shot dead in Medellín by far-right paramilitaries. It is adapted from the 2005 memoir of Gómez by his son, the now prominent Colombian author Héctor Abad Faciolince, entitled El Olvido Que Seremos (which is the movie’s original Spanish title), meaning Forgotten We’ll Be. (It is taken from the Borges poem, The Epitaph: “Already we are the oblivion we shall be.”) Cámara plays Gómez, the professor, husband and father to a lively and talented family of mostly girls, and one somewhat pampered son: Hector, played by Nicolás Reyes Cano as a moon-faced boy and then by Juan Pablo Urrego as an earnest, bespectacled literature student. Gómez is adored by his family, by his students and by the local community in Medellín, in whose streets he is an inspiring figure, striding around proselytising for what he calls the five basic human rights: air, water, food, shelter and affection. But he is continuously harassed by the authorities for these progressive views, and forced to take an evasive sabbatical abroad at one stage and finally early retirement. The movie has “present-tense” scenes in the 1980s, shot in black and white, but Hector’s ecstatically remembered 1970s childhood is shot in sunlit colour. This is a wonderfully sympathetic, deeply felt and tenderly funny family drama with a novelistic attention to details and episodes – a little like Alfonso Cuáron’s Roma, about growing up in a similar era in Mexico City. Cámara thoroughly inhabits the figure of Gómez: unselfconsciously inspiring and lovable. • Memories of My Father is released on 26 March on Curzon Home Cinema.",Memories of My Father,FILM
202,Made in Italy review – autobiographical poignancy from Liam Neeson and son,"The big, unique selling point of this somewhat sappy but quite watchable feature is that the two main roles – a charismatic, widowed artist named Robert and his handsome but still finding-his-feet-careerwise son Jack – are played by Liam Neeson and his real-life son, up-and-coming actor Micheál Richardson. In the film, Robert’s wife/Jack’s mother died tragically young in a car accident. This, of course, parallels the death of Neeson’s real-life wife/Richardson’s mother, Natasha, from injuries incurred during a skiing accident when her sons were still in their teens. Knowing all this adds a certain frisson to the climactic scene where father and son have it out about the different ways they handled the late woman’s death. But the lack of finesse, in scriptwriting terms, with which the emotional punch is landed robs the scene of the impact it deserves. Elsewhere, the yarn is more entertaining as an uber-bougie slice of property porn about the two men bonding as they fix up, with ludicrously obvious symbolism, the palatial Tuscan house they inherited from Jack’s late mother. Jack, it transpires, wants to sell the place so he can buy an art gallery he ran for his own ex-wife’s family. Obviously, he’s going to be tempted away from that path by the golden sunlight of the region and the charms of pretty local woman Natalia (Valeria Bilello); the kind of restaurant owner who, unlike any real-life restaurateur, doesn’t seem to need to spend much time at her establishment, leaving her lots of free hours to float about in tea dresses and hang out with the visiting menfolk from London painting walls. Realism is clearly not a strong suit for writer-director James D’Arcy, but he gets pretty good comic performances from his likeable cast, which includes Lindsay Duncan as an acerbic estate agent. •Made in Italy is released on 26 March on Amazon Prime Video.",Made in Italy,FILM
203,Retaliation review – Orlando Bloom gives it his all in lacerating sexual-abuse drama,"Orlando Bloom has often looked perfectly happy with a Hollywood career, starring in movies as opposed to necessarily acting in them. But he outdoes himself in this British indie drama playing a man traumatised by childhood sexual abuse at the hands of a Catholic priest. There’s a kind of blunt brute force to his performance – and he looks almost unrecognisable, as if he’s using certain muscles in his face for the first time. The film is a horror story: a disturbing, hard-to-watch ordeal with a lacerating script by Geoff Thompson, a sexual-abuse survivor who has written courageously about his own experience. Bloom is Malcolm, known to everyone as Malky, a nickname that doesn’t remotely suit him. He swaggers about full of rage, flying into a temper if anyone so much as looks at him funny. Malcolm works in the macho world of demolition, stripping old churches of fixtures and fittings before the bulldozers move in. Just in case you miss the point, his mum says over tea: “There’s a lot of churches. You won’t be able to knock them all down.” There’s a good deal of this sort of heavy symbolism, giving the whole thing an overcooked, oppressive feel. Malcolm’s shame and fear of intimacy emerge in some unflinchingly grim scenes. Sex with his on-off barmaid girlfriend (Janet Montgomery) is cold and horrible. At home, in secret, Malcolm abuses himself, staring into the mirror while he rapes himself with a wooden truncheon – it’s a shocking moment, and it will be too much for some. One day, having a pint in his local, Malcolm spots the paedophile priest (James Smillie) who raped him – he’s been moved back to the parish. The confrontation and narrative resolution that follow feel a bit hastily sketched-out. But there are lines here that land like a punch: “I was 12. When I woke up the next day I was 100.” • Retaliation is released on 26 March on digital platforms.",Retaliation,FILM
204,New photo shows Kristen Stewart as Princess Diana ahead of biopic Spencer,"A new image of Kristen Stewart as Princess Diana has been released, as shooting on forthcoming biopic Spencer moves to the UK. Stewart, 30, will play the late princess in the film, directed by Chilean film-maker Pablo Larraín, whose biopic of Jackie Kennedy starring Natalie Portman won multiple Oscar nominations in 2017. In the photograph, Stewart smiles directly at the camera, wearing a layered blond bob as well as tartan blazer and diamond engagement ring that appear to be copies of those sported by the real woman. The film’s autumn release follows rave reviews for the most recent season of Netflix’s The Crown, in which Emma Corrin played the princess, winning a Golden Globe for her performance, as did Josh O’Connor as Prince Charles. The actor playing Prince Charles in the new film will be Jack Farthing, best known as baddie George Warleggan in BBC’s Poldark. Farthing, 35, also played John Lennon in ITV’s Cilla Black series and featured in The Riot Club, the big-screen version of the play Posh. The film is scripted by Peaky Blinders’ Steven Knight, and scored by Radiohead’s Jonny Greenwood. Supporting cast include Timothy Spall, Sally Hawkins and Sean Harris. The actors playing the young princes William and Harry have not been announced; last year, British passport holders were ruled out of contention for the roles over post-Brexit visa concerns. Spencer is set over the course of a decisive weekend in December 1991, during which Princess Diana spends the Christmas holidays with the royal family at Sandringham, and decides to leave her marriage to Prince Charles. “The Prince and Princess of Wales’ marriage has long since grown cold,” reads a press release. “Though rumours of affairs and a divorce abound, peace is ordained for the Christmas festivities at Sandringham Estate. There’s eating and drinking, shooting and hunting. Diana knows the game. This year, things will be a whole lot different.” It’s the first big feature film to be made about the princess since 2013’s much-ridiculed Diana, which starred Naomi Watts and was labelled “car crash cinema” by the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw. Stewart described Spencer in a statement as “a dive inside an emotional imagining of who Diana was at a pivotal turning point in her life”. Filming was taking place in Germany, but has moved to the UK. The film is scheduled for release this autumn.",Kristen Stewart,PERFORMER
205,Bafta diversity scheme participant says casting director made racist comments,"A scheme set up by Bafta with the aim of improving diversity in the film and TV industry has come under fire from one of its former participants, who said she had experienced racist comments and a lack of promised disability support. India Eva Rae, who joined Bafta’s Elevate programme in 2019, told the BBC that a casting director told her she was an “exotic talent”, and that they “can’t understand the English coming out your mouth”. Rae also said that she had been told not to report the incident by a “mentor” on the scheme: “This mentor told me and other members of the group that we will never work again if we speak up.” Bafta CEO Amanda Berry said in response that the organisation “was aware that [Rae] had had a negative experience with a casting director, as they mentioned it in passing … but we are not aware that this happened as part of the Elevate programme.” The BBC also report that Bafta said it had not received any complaints about either incident, but that if it had, they would have been taken extremely seriously. Rae also said she had difficulties accessing disability support. Rae was selected in 2019 for Bafta’s Elevate programme after featuring in the Channel 4 anthology series On the Edge. Elevate was set up in 2017 and is described by Bafta as “a new bespoke annual programme that aims to elevate individuals from under-represented groups to the next stage of their career”. It was one of a set of initiatives introduced by Bafta to increase diversity in the film and TV industry, alongside changes to eligibility for its awards and membership process. Bafta recently joined the the BFI to relaunch a programme to combat bullying, harassment and racism in the screen industries. Berry added: “It is a matter of great sadness and regret for me that anyone would feel this way, and our door remains completely open to find a solution, and to ensure that every participant benefits from the scheme.” “I know that other participants have found this to be a truly fantastic opportunity.” In a statement to Deadline, Bafta said: “Bafta condemns bullying, harassment, racism and discrimination of any kind and we take allegations of this nature incredibly seriously and will investigate urgently. We go to great lengths to ensure our programmes are as inclusive and accessible as possible for everyone who takes part, whatever their specific support needs are, and have responded to and want to resolve the participant’s requests in this area.”",Bafta diversity scheme participant,OTHERS
206,Tom & Jerry The Movie review – sanitised relaunch of the cat and mouse combatants,"Whoever wins, parents lose. While there’s little to truly loathe in Fantastic Four and Ride Along director Tim Story’s frantic new take on Tom &amp; Jerry, there’s also an equal lack of anything to truly love; this is a serviceable, if entirely forgettable attempt to relaunch an old property for a new audience. Very young kids might find some enjoyment in the brightly hued, fast-paced mania of it all, but those with any real affection for the pair of violently opposed animals will leave unimpressed. With a script that feels lazily retrofitted to revolve around the two animals rather than designed directly for them, this is basically a kids’ movie about antics in a New York hotel that pauses every so often to feature a sanitised fight between the pair. The decision to combine live action with animation often jars (every human is real, every animal is animated) and, within the realism of Manhattan, we’re then left with questions about the rules that have been haphazardly set up. (Why, for example, can some animals talk but not others? Violence seems to cause no harm to animals, so would humans also be immune?). These are questions that we perhaps wouldn’t be forced to ask if the film itself were more engaging. Chloë Grace Moretz, playing a grifter turned hotel employee turned cat and mouse peacemaker, is at least well-suited to the material. Her precocious brand of acting has seemed to pause rather than progress as she segues from child to adulthood, but her over-pronounced comedy works well here – there’s a brisk efficiency to her scenes with suspicious co-workers played by Rob Delaney and Michael Peña (both far more comfortable than SNL’s Colin Jost, fully lost). The animals themselves are a little underpowered, their signature scraps never quite inventive or audacious enough. The film’s sunny energy and its refreshing lack of toilet humour (something that’s stunk up many a kids’ movie in recent years) makes it an inoffensive effort, but it’ll race from your memory faster than Jerry from Tom. • Tom &amp; Jerry The Movie is released on 25 March on digital platforms.",Tom & Jerry The Movie,FILM
207,Violation review – a brutal and brilliant debut,"The revenge movie is the blunt weapon in the film-maker’s toolkit. Audience bloodlust is sated by justifiable violence; we get a guilt-free kick out of the kicking because justice is seen to be served. As a genre, it’s effective, but basic. Infinitely more unsettling and challenging are the films that dissect the whole idea of revenge, confronting the audience with its own complicity – films such as Gaspar Noé’s Irréversible and now Madeleine Sims-Fewer and Dusty Mancinelli’s brutal and brilliant directorial debut, Violation. Violation is as much a film about trauma as it is about revenge. In a PTSD-shattered timeline, the remarkable Sims-Fewer plays Miriam, a woman visiting her sister (Anna Maguire) and brother-in-law (Jesse LaVercombe). The sisters cling to a comfort blanket of shared history, but it’s soon stained by an act of betrayal. Miriam finds herself compelled to seek revenge. But no amount of meticulous planning can prepare her – and us – for the visceral realities of the act. The muted natural light of dawn and dusk elsewhere in the film is a contrast to the scorching campfire orange that drenches the violence; the naturalism of the performances is heightened by merciless details in the sound design. It’s gruelling, but fiercely intelligent film-making. Available exclusively on Shudder",Violation,FILM
208,Memories of My Father review – loving portrait of a parent,"A child’s-eye view of a hero father – Javier Cámara stars as dedicated parent, doctor, human-rights leader and all-round good egg Héctor Abad Gómez – is saturated with a honeyed colour palette and an unapologetically sentimental score. But as the child grows into an adult, the film adopts starker black-and-white photography and a harder-edged approach to Colombia’s tumultuous political backdro. Adapted, somewhat inelegantly, from an autobiographical novel by Héctor Abad Faciolince, Memories of My Father is a touch overlong and soapy and awkwardly structured. But it’s still an engrossingly watchable drama. • On Curzon Home Cinema",Memories of My Father,FILM
209,Tom and Jerry review – wearisome live action adaptation,"The long-running feud between cat and smart-aleck mouse gets a new platform in this feature-length adaptation of the Hanna Barbera cartoon. The backdrop is a swanky Manhattan hotel, which is set to host the wedding of the year. The approach, a marriage of cluttered live action with madcap 2D animation, owes an obvious debt to Who Framed Roger Rabbit, but has more in common with the wearisome and unfunny Garfield: The Movie. Chloë Grace Moretz stars as Kayla, an opportunist who cons her way into a job using a stolen résumé. It’s astute casting – Moretz’s habitually overblown acting style seems slightly less jarring when juxtaposed with rampaging cartoon elephants. The film is most entertaining when it wreaks havoc – a car chase involving a commandeered military drone is a slickly executed riot. But lazy writing squashes any real fun as emphatically as an Acme anvil dropped from a roof. • Available on all platforms",Tom and Jerry,FILM
210,Undine review – a shaggy catfish of a story about a woman with a water obsession,"Christian Petzold’s Undine is an intriguing, bemusing oddity of a film: a suspense drama-thriller with a fey supernatural twist. It’s a sphinx that, if not exactly without a secret, has less of a secret than it thinks it has. And it is possible to come away from the film less than convinced, but very impressed by the sheer force of Petzold’s film-making talent (recently so stunning in his drama Transit) but which has been here deployed for something which is a bit flimsy and silly. Paula Beer plays Undine who, as her name suggests, may have intense sympathies with water. She lives in Berlin, and is a stylish and elegant historian who lectures on the city’s architectural history at the Berlin City Models exhibition. But she is also conducting an unhappy adulterous affair with Johannes (Jacob Matschenz), which is reaching its unhappy end at the film’s opening - revealing a flash of something angry and even violent in Undine. But in the midst of this traumatic episode, Undine is to have a fateful encounter with a strange man who has heard her lecture, and appears to be in love with her. This is Christoph, an underwater diver played by Franz Rogowski - a sensual screen presence with a little of Joaquin Phoenix. Soon Undine and Christoph are having a passionate affair, and he introduces her to his mysterious professional world, little guessing that she may be far more at home in it than he ever could be. Their relationship is passionately sensual, though Undine is perplexed at the sheer rapture with which Christoph listens to her lectures about Berlin’s planning history. Is there a metaphorical dimension to this? Maybe. Certainly their emotional connection has restored something like happiness to her, and effaced the mad furious unhappiness of her former liaison. But then she is to chance across Johannes once again and a terrible destiny begins to stir in those watery depths with which Undine feels such empathy. In truth, Undine is a bit of a shaggy dog story, or maybe a slimy giant catfish story; though it is just so skilfully made, beautifully acted and directed. Rogowski brings something unstable and dangerous to the part and so, in a more contained way, does Beer. What might this cast and this director do if they were working on a more compelling and substantial story? As it stands, Undine is a diverting and handsomely crafted piece of fantasy. • Released on 2 April on Curzon Home Cinema",Undine,FILM
211,Wilderness review – young lovers' lost weekend,"Here’s an interesting project from the film school at Falmouth University: a low-budget drama put together by four film-makers – including director Justin John Doherty and screenwriter Neil Fox, a Falmouth lecturer – with professional actors but otherwise crewed entirely by student first-timers skipping the intern phase. The result is rather lovely, a talky cine-literate portrait of a new relationship set in the 1960s. (I’m not sure you could make such an uncynical film about a couple falling in love in the present day.) It reminded me a little of Blue Valentine, without the messy raw bits, or the divorce – basically before Ryan Gosling gets a beer gut. There’s a nice emotional fluency to James Barnes’ performance as John, a thoughtful jazz musician who drives with his new girlfriend Alice (Katharine Davenport) to a cottage by the sea for the weekend. There is terrific chemistry between the pair; they can’t keep their hands off each other. But John has a gnawing fear that it won’t last, that love will fade. Alice is sunnier-natured, a bit careless of other people’s feelings. There are two crisis episodes over the weekend. John takes Alice for dinner at the house of old friends, another couple, who have left London. The husband Charlie (Sebastian Badarau) is a drummer who has given up touring to teach. Nothing much happens but it emerges that John hasn’t been honest about how well he knows the wife Francis (Bean Downes). Feeling betrayed, Alice ruthlessly flirts with both Charlie and Francis to punish him. Hungover the next day they get stranded on the beach as the tide comes in. Everything plays out in absorbing emotional detail. My only reservation with the film is how tasteful it is – from Alice’s chic boyish haircut to the Scandi-chrome coffee pot and the sweat-free sex. And it’s out of politeness perhaps that the film avoids the issue of race. John is black, and Alice is white, and there’s a nasty incident on the beach when a dog tramples their picnic. Its owner, a tweed-capped toff, is blatantly racist; it’s as clear as daylight. The couple talk about everything, but not this? • Wilderness is released on 5 April on digital platforms.",Wilderness,FILM
212,Selfie review – droll Gallic eye on slaves to the algorithm,"As ever-evolving technologies produce instant gratifications and fresh horrors, Selfie sees modern life as a tragicomic minefield fraught with absurdities. This French anthology film delivers biting social critique with a side helping of je ne sais quoi wit. Across five loosely connected stories from five seasoned film-makers (including Rust and Bone scriptwriter Thomas Bidegain), human idiosyncrasies are constricted by algorithms and reduced to likes. Though pushed to ridiculous comedic heights, Selfie’s cautionary tales are not so far-fetched. A married couple whose famous vlogs revolve around their son’s cancer scramble for content now that he is cured. In a reversal of stereotypes, a female teacher anonymously ambushes a viral male comedian with vicious tweets, only to pique his romantic interest. A seemingly content man slowly unravels as he blindly obeys his algorithmic ads. An awkward millennial manipulates his ratings on a dating app through nefarious methods. And finally, the farcical pièce de résistance: on an island with limited phone signals, a wedding goes haywire as a massive data hack reveals everyone’s dirtiest online secrets. All (digital) hell breaks loose. Underneath these satirical Black Mirror-esque scenarios are all-too-relatable emotional issues. The characters wrestle with online abuse, shopping addiction, stalking impulses and countless other urban malaises. Notifications overstuff their lives – and the film’s frame – yet leave them dissatisfied. No wonder they whisper online metrics as pillow talk. It’s a weakness that, for a film so heavily centred on social media, Selfie lacks tech savviness when it comes to certain platforms. For instance, in the “Vlog” section, it makes little sense that the couple’s videos fluctuate between two million views one moment and a measly 900 hits the next simply because of the cancer-free announcement. Nevertheless, Selfie’s cackleworthy dialogues and energetic performances more than make up for the occasional missteps. • Selfie is released on 26 March on Your Screen.",Selfie,FILM
213,"Last Call review – bad news, good booze","This soft-headed comedy-drama has the profundity and about the same wit level of one of those joke signs you see above bars, and often feels like it was scripted on a hangover after a two-day bender. Jeremy Piven plays Mick, prodigal real estate-developer son who returns to his old stomping ground of Darby Heights (based on Philadelphia’s Upper Darby) for his mother’s funeral. His feckless buddies, including jail-hopping brother Dougal (Zach McGowan), are still living their old boozy lives. What Mick thinks will revitalise the neighbourhood – and fend off the real-estate sharks circling, among other things, his dad’s pub – is a new casino. The obvious contradiction here – that Mick’s idea is ridiculous, and he is in fact part of what is threatening Darby Heights – is never meaningfully broached, as Last Call lets the hot topic of gentrification go begging. Director Paolo Pilladi and writer Greg Lingo (who is from Upper Darby) are so fired up making the film an ode to bar-room high jinks and blue-collar camaraderie that characterisation suffers. The boys call Mick out for forgetting his roots – but dragging him off for the umpteenth binge, they are mystifyingly unquestioning of his canvassing for the casino. Last Call visibly crunches gears when it does remember to tackle Mick’s divided loyalties, like when he (implausibly) asks one of his real-estate associates outside when he gets into a spat with a bar pal. The badinage is sporadically funny – even if it drifts too much towards the puerile, as with a running gag about Mick’s priapism problem. But any hope Last Call might skate by on working-class charm is hobbled by Pilladi’s timid direction: flat-footed and full of unimaginative choices. When Mick and his dad are having a heart-to-heart, Irish folk music lilts on the soundtrack; for the Greek family of Mick’s crush, Ali (Taryn Manning), it’s jaunty rebetiko. It all lets down an impressive cast that includes Bruce Dern, Raging Bull’s Cathy Moriarty and Scream’s Jamie Kennedy. One of the boys in Entourage, Piven breezes through likably enough – possibly they hoped that was a pass for the film’s flakiness. • Last Call is released on 29 March on digital plaforms.",Last Call,FILM
214,Paintball Massacre review – splatterhouse horror with scattershot acting,"This scruffy British-made comedy-horror, helmed by debut director Darren Berry, features a large ensemble cast with an extremely wide range of acting skills. Sadly, just as the story itself turns on how each individual’s flaws endanger the whole team, the same goes for the movie itself: thudding line readings and embarrassing bursts of overacting sully the better work on display. But maybe it’s a fool’s errand to expect much better from a film about a team of paintballers, all friends from a secondary school who graduated in 2004, being murdered one by one in comically grotesque ways in a tatty woodland area near a quarry. The makers have cited British comedy-horror features Hot Fuzz and Dog Soldiers as touchstones. Knowing that at least serves to help viewers appreciate how deftly the writer-directors of those earlier films, Edgar Wright and Neil Marshall, balance comic timing and tension-building, while coaxing good performances. But even they might have struggled with mayhem on a paintball course, a daft premise that isn’t exploited as well as it might have been – given how innately silly this mock military pastime is, one so beloved of middle-management types and macho-minded suburbanites. But at least Natasha Killip, as a filthy-mouthed, evil-tempered glamour model, and Aoife Smyth as a perpetually stoned fan of the Fast and the Furious franchise are around to perk up the scenes they’re in with well-timed insult comedy and stream-of-consciousness monologues about Vin Diesel and Paul Walker. Reliably funny comedian Katy Brand is also good for a few laughs as one of the paintball course’s marshals, especially when she is found lying irritably on the ground with half her intestines pulled out. The rest of the cast seems to consist mostly of interchangeable bearded white guys. • Paintball Massacre is released on 5 April on digital formats.",Paintball Massacre,FILM
215,Zana review – witchy wisdom and Lynchian shadows in Kosovan drama,"Lume (Adriana Matoshi) and her husband Ilir (Astrit Kabashi) managed to survive the late 90s war in Kosovo, but suffered the unthinkable loss of their young daughter, Zana, who was killed in crossfire. The years have passed on the farm where they live with Ilir’s formidable mother Remzije (Fatmire Sahiti), and the waters of everyday routine have flowed back into the scars. But Lume cannot let go of the past. Although seemingly the good, submissive little wifey that this close-knit, extremely old-fashioned society expects her to be, she’s racked with sorrow, and suffers from constant nightmares, featuring images that range from disturbing and bloody to downright David Lynchian, full of shadows and veiled figures backlit by moonlight. Remzije is pressuring Ilir to consider taking a second wife so that he can sire more children now that Lume can’t seem to get pregnant. In desperation, Lume agrees to see faith healers: the first, a witchy but wise woman in their own village; the second, a more sinister character who charges €500 per consultation and is prone to diagnosing demonic possession. Kosovan writer-director Antoneta Kastrati draws deep from the wells of both her homeland’s tragedy and her own in this disturbing, unnerving story. The flecks of horror in the way she handles some of the nightmare imagery may trigger some viewers to expect a different outcome from the deep drink of bleak we finally get served. Zana is a tough watch, but Matoshi’s fine-grained performance is a blessing to watch and there are incidental pleasures, particularly in the way the film languishes in the sultry, cruelly fecund landscape. On an anthropological level, there is something especially fascinating about this insider’s view of Kosovo society, where archaic beliefs about family mores rub up against people watching YouTube to learn new recipes for family meals. • Zana is on digital platforms from 2 April.",Zana,FILM
216,Oscars poised to loosen no-Zoom policy for this year's ceremony,"Producers for this year’s Oscars ceremony are said to be considering relaxing their policy of mandatory in-person attendance for this year’s nominees. According to a story in the Hollywood Reporter, the Academy has invited all nominees to participate in a Tuesday morning Zoom “conversation with show producers” Steven Soderbergh, Stacey Sher and Jesse Collins. This will include “updates about the show” as well as details on options should they need to participate remotely. Earlier this month, producers had said there would “not be an option to Zoom in for the show” and that nominees should turn up instead at Los Angeles’ Union Station, where this year’s ceremony will primarily take place. While most of this year’s nominees are based in the US, concern had been raised over the finances, logistics and safety of those based elsewhere flying to Los Angeles for the ceremony on 25 April. England has currently banned non-essential international travel until mid-May, although work exemptions are in place as evidenced by performers such as Harry Styles attending the Grammy awards earlier this month. Representatives of the five international feature films – submitted by Denmark, Hong Kong, Romania, Tunisia and Bosnia – could also face hurdles getting to Los Angeles. Speaking to the Guardian, Alexander Nanau, the director of Romanian film Collective, which is nominated for both best documentary and best international feature film, said: “We certainly hope to be there – provided it’s safe and logistics allow – but we trust the Academy will find a solution to accommodate nominees who face difficult travel restrictions.” Visitors to California are currently expected to quarantine for 10 days, incurring considerable expense and inconvenience, while the re-entry requirements for travellers back to their own countries vary widely.

217,The Night review – eerie check-in at an LA hotel,"The fundamental creepiness of hotels is the driving force behind this very potent supernatural mystery-thriller from Iranian-American film-maker Kourosh Ahari: the creepiness of their deserted corridors, their stately or shabby lobbies, and their anonymous rooms, whose blankness keeps the secret of their previous occupants. It’s a creepiness that predates and is independent of Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining, though that’s admittedly an influence here. In modern-day Los Angeles, a young Iranian couple with a baby – Babak (Shahab Hosseini) and Neda (Niousha Noor) – are at a dinner party with friends in an unfamiliar part of town. They are tired and quarrelsome on the way home; Babak is really too drunk to drive, and Neda has lost her licence after an earlier run-in with a traffic cop, so they grumpily decide to check in to the nearest hotel. This turns out to be the Hotel Normandie (perhaps calling it “Hotel California” would have been too on-the-nose). The sinister receptionist of this odd establishment (George Maguire) tells them he only has a suite available: irritable and impatient, Babak takes it. So it is extremely disturbing for them to discover that they are in fact the hotel’s only guests, which moreover leaves them unable to explain the sudden heartstopping thumps on the door and the children crying for their mummy outside their room. Are they being haunted by some awful presence in the hotel, or by the festering secrets and lies in their own relationship? All these are ingredients for the kind of scary movie that’s usually a terrible cliche, and to be fair, there’s nothing obviously new about The Night. But it is put together with great style, force and visual imagination, and Ahari deftly uses the couple’s baby to ratchet up the tension. Uniformed authority figures, initially disturbing or intimidating, suddenly profess themselves to be entranced by the baby and ask if they may hold her – and somehow the couple can’t find a polite way of saying no. It delivers a clammy shiver of disquiet. • The Night is released on 2 April on digital platforms.",The Night,FILM
218,Tom Hanks’s son criticized for using ‘racist’ font on merchandise collection,"Chet Hanks, son of the Hollywood actor Tom Hanks, has been criticized for using a “racist” font on his new collection of merchandise which is also controversially called White Boy Summer. His black and white range of clothes, which include hoodies, T-shirts, shorts, tank tops, leggings, caps and bike shorts, has been called out online for its use of a Gothic-style font that is close to the one used by white nationalists. It’s also similar to the Fraktur fonts, which were used in Nazi Germany most prominently on the cover of Hitler’s Mein Kampf book. “Hmm unfortunately the merch looks aggressively racist,” wrote one commentator on Twitter, while another wrote: “Jesus. When I think of typefaces white people should avoid, anything remotely calligraphic/blackletter looking pops immediately to mind, especially if it’s going to include the word ‘White’.” While on Hanks’s official Instagram a user said: “Proud Boys are gonna buy these tf up.” The Proud Boys are a far-right US group and in September fashion line Fred Perry withdrew their polo shirts which had been adopted by them. Hanks, who raps under the moniker Chet Haze and has acted in the TV shows Shameless and Empire, came up with the term “White Boy Summer” on Friday – a play on the Megan Thee Stallion song from 2019 Hot Girl Summer. “I just got this feeling man that this summer … it’s about to be a white boy summer,” he said. “Take it how you want, I’m not talking about Trump, Nascar-type white. I’m talking about me, (rappers) Jon B. Jack Harlow-type white boys, you know what I mean? Let me know if you guys can vibe with that, and get ready. ‘Cause I am.’” In a video posted a few days later, he clarified: “You know what’s not White Boy Summer … is having any ill will or prejudice towards anybody from a different background, race, walk of life than you.” On Tuesday Hanks announced he was also launching a range of Black Queen Summer merchandise, using the same font. “I want to see some white boys and some black queens wearing each other’s shirts,” he said in a video introducing them.

219,Original Gangster review – hitman thuggery misfires,"Original? Nah. You could put this grim, unimaginative London crime drama under a microscope and still not find the teensiest speck of originality. It’s a nasty little film, shallow and badly acted, with a queasy macho streak – like a Guy Ritchie, only without the subtlety or attention to female characters. Original Gangster follows the rise of a hitman and begins with his backstory. As a 10-or-so-year-old, Castor (Badger Skelton) is spared death by Milo (Ian Reddington), a thug who murders his parents. For the next decade, orphaned Castor lives rough in London parks, eating cold beans out of the tin and honing his mugging skills; this is a film where men commit violence in swaggering slo-mo, music blaring. The illiterate voiceover feels like a parody: “The street was a money-hungry whore who demanded paying before providing me with her sweet pussy.” Nice. Skip ahead a decade, and Castor (played by Alex Mills with the charisma of a toaster), runs into Milo again. Milo is now a successful drug dealer who introduces Castor to American crime kingpin Jean-Baptiste (a career low from Steve Guttenberg). Milo also invites Castor round for dinner at his gaff, where we see him humiliate and physically assault his much younger wife (Isabele De Rosa). The film has a serious woman problem. Its female characters are either dead and saintly, or nags who get hit by men. In one scene, Castor is drinking alone in a graveyard when a young woman angrily tells him to move on. (Which completely misjudges the response of most women to being alone in a space with a lairy drunk man twice her size). When Castor calls her “darling” she rants at him: “Do you know nothing about the #MeToo movement, you misogynist pig?” So he thumps her. Thirty minutes later, the script wants you to root for him as love interest to Milo’s wife, herself a victim of violence. Do me a favour. • Original Gangster is released on 5 April on digital platforms and DVD.",Original Gangster,FILM
220,Catch Us If You Can review – on the run with the Dave Clark Five,"A year after Richard Lester’s A Hard Day’s Night, and a year before the Monkees were grown in TV’s pop culture lab, director John Boorman made his feature debut with this very English madcap pop lark from 1965, scripted by Peter Nichols and starring the Dave Clark Five as themselves. Or almost. They’re not supposed to be musicians, but rather stunt-men who live together in a wacky shared flat (evidently a converted church organ loft) that is dominated by gigantic posters of the sort generally collected by wealthy pop-art enthusiasts. Dave Clark plays handsome Steve, first among equals in the gang, and they’re filming a TV commercial for the meat-marketing board starring It -girl and supermodel Dinah (Barbara Ferris). She’s so important she has a bodyguard on the set, who frowningly reads The Naked Lunch. Dinah has a crush on Steve, and the couple impulsively decide to abandon the shoot, pinching the production’s E-type Jag and going on the run together for zany 60s-style misadventures – an escapade cynically exploited for publicity by Leon (played by silvery-voiced David de Keyser) who is the UK’s meat supremo and also apparently Dinah’s creepy sugar-daddy. This film is amiably daft, pretty clunky and dated, but a very potent time-capsule for the 1960s: like the early movies of Godard, it is obsessed with the language of publicity: advertising, magazines, the mass media. Yootha Joyce has a ripe cameo as an older woman who takes an interest in our Steve – though without pressing her attentions in ways that would have taken this film out of the teen/family entertainment bracket – and there is an odd scene in which Dinah and Steve warily encounter some grumpy hippies in a ruined building; here Britcom fans will enjoy the appearance of Sheila Fearn (Terry’s sister in The Likely Lads). An archival frisson. • Catch Us If You Can is released on 5 April on digital formats.",Catch Us If You Can,FILM
221,Antebellum review – the horrors of slavery repackaged as entertainment,"There’s an increasingly wariness of slavery dramas. Must suffering always be the lens on Black lives? On the other hand though, the success of Get Out has Hollywood excited about the genre flick’s potential to interrogate America’s oldest, truest horror. Caught in the middle is Antebellum, starring Janelle Monáe: a film that attempts so much and fails at almost all of it. Debut writer-directors Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz offer an early display of proficiency with a tracking shot across an old south plantation: the “big house”, the cotton fields, the Spanish moss and the slave quarters, all handsomely bathed in the magic-hour glow and, later, by flickering candlelight. Acts of violent suppression happen in balletic slo-mo, allowing time to observe that some period details seem strangely off. These hints culminate in a mobile ringtone that seems to shift Monáe’s character – apparently a brutalised slave called Eden – to a new reality. She fell asleep next to her rapist and enslaver, but she wakes up surrounded by her loving family in their comfortable home. “Eden” is now “Veronica”, a prominent sociologist in 21st-century US, whose high-flying career takes her to a speaking engagement in New Orleans, and dinner out with friends (Gabourey Sidibe among them). This is a better life, certainly, but it is progress depicted in the shallowest terms. Veronica’s supposedly nourishing friendships are nothing but stereotypical sass and self-care prattle; her supposedly fiery politics consist of strung-together platitudes. The Black woman at Antebellum’s centre is as one-dimensional as the evil white racists on its peripheries. When one of these commences a whipping by saying, “It brings me no joy to do this”, the claim rings doubly false. Antebellum offers neither a coherent social commentary nor – thanks to its pat, ahistorical ending – a revenge thriller’s catharsis. What else, besides entertainment, could its purpose be? • Antebellum is released on 2 April on Sky Cinema.",Antebellum,FILM
222,Godzilla vs. Kong review – a spectacular battle of beasts,"“There can’t be two alphas,” insists Rebecca Hall’s Dr Ilene Andrews. Well, quite. Adam Wingard’s cleanly choreographed spin on the Japanese kaiju movie is vastly superior to 2019’s muddy Godzilla: King of the Monsters, pitting the radioactive lizard against ancient enemy King Kong and launching the latter into the Earth’s apparently hollow core. The spectacle is more involving than the plot, especially the dazzling image of Kong floating skyward, serene and surrounded by purple glowing rocks.

223,Rose: A Love Story review – woodland-shack thriller goes to ground,"There’s a promising setup to this claustrophobic survivalist horror-thriller, written by its co-star Matt Stokoe, who performs opposite his real-life partner Sophie Rundle. But despite some strong moments and a theme which speaks to these times of coronoviral anxiety, the film doesn’t quite work dramatically or gel emotionally, with some odd, strained mood-shifts and uncertain dialogue scenes between the three lead characters towards the end. Rundle and Stokoe play Rose and Sam, a couple who live hermit-like in a remote woodland shack, almost as if in some postapocalyptic dystopia, though it is supposed to be the present day. Rose must be intensively looked after because of a medical condition requiring her to stay indoors, and certain dietary requirements that mean Sam has to get leeches by mail order. She is a writer, working on a novel on an old-fashioned typewriter, and Sam gets food by setting traps for rabbits in the surrounding forest and growing vegetables (though they evidently have enough cash for their needs, presumably including electricity bills). But their tense existence is threatened by Sam’s furious dispute with the person who is supposed to be their point of contact with the outside world, and then by the arrival of Amber (Olive Gray), a troubled young woman on the run from problems of her own. You cannot find fault with any of the performances as such. But in narrative terms, Amber’s appearance out of the blue – an event unconnected to the apparent “Straw Dogs” situation developing with the guys with whom Sam had been previously doing business – and Rose and Sam’s subsequent, bafflingly changeable behaviour towards her, are unconvincing. This feels like a project that could have done with more script development, good though the actors are. Rose: A Love Story is released on 5 April on digital platforms.",Rose: A Love Story,FILM
224,Infinitum: Subject Unknown review – solo time loop echoes lockdown,"You’ve got to admire wife and husband film-makers Tori and Matthew Butler-Hart. Stuck in their London flat at the start of the pandemic, the pair wrote a sci-fi script together: a Groundhog-Day-meets-The-Matrix tale of a woman trapped in a time loop. They shot it à deux on an iPhone; she stars, he directs. And there are a couple of cameos, from Ian McKellen and Game of Thrones actor Conleth Hill (who quite literally phoned in their performances from home). It’s a genuinely impressive achievement, but for a film about the infinite possibilities of parallel universes, it’s exasperatingly samey. Tori Butler-Hart is Jane, a woman who wakes up every morning tied to a chair in the attic of a London semi with no memory of how she got there. Outside, the streets are eerily quiet. Scared but resourceful, Jane finds a door hidden behind a pile of junk. A camera on the wall is watching – and from time to time the soundtrack picks up the voices of her observers, distorted and crackling. Jane’s lockdown ordeal is replayed over and over again with slightly different variations – in way that begins to feel more ad nauseam than infinitum. Every day she wakes up in the chair, and every day gets a little closer to freedom: down the stairs, out of the back door, into a car. Then something happens to terrify her and bang, it’s back in the chair. Appearances from McKellen (sporting a dapper lockdown beard) and Hill don’t add much. The pair play physicists from the Wytness Quantum Research Centre – the place Jane is trying to reach. They speak to camera, talking heads on a documentary, but, frustratingly, explain very little. What ideas are here never really come to life. Though perhaps in the future, the film will come to look like a lockdown time-capsule: a reminder of the fear and isolation of spring 2020, and the unnerving feeling of standing in empty streets in towns and cities as if the world has stopped. • Infinitum: Subject Unknown is out now on digital formats.",Infinitum: Subject Unknown,FILM
225,"A Dragon’s Adventure review – a mess of mind-melting, happy-clappy animation ","Rendered in supersaturated shades of mind-melting magenta, burnt-retina orange and eye-ache azure, this computer animated kids’ story (adapted from a German TV series called Der kleine Drache Kokosnuss) revolves around a somewhat socially divided community of dragons. In the strange taxonomy of this universe, there are flying Fire Dragons who can breathe fire, aquatic region-dwelling Water Dragons who speak a different language but know some pidgin English and, unaccountably, spiny-backed Gourmet Dragons who like to cook. There are also Fur Dragons and various other sorts, but for the purpose of this film the main characters are drawn from the ranks of the Fire and the Gourmet Dragons. They mostly peacefully co-exist in one seaside, although there are occasionally snarky comments about each other’s habits, suggesting that the respective groupings could be read as cultural or racial differences. Nevertheless, an effort to foster better inter-dragon harmony results in the organisation of a summer camp, so Fire Dragon hero Coconut and his best friend Oscar, a Gourmet Dragon, sail forth with chaperones for an island where Coconut’s grandfather remembers once meeting the exotic Water Dragons. They smuggle their friend Mathilda, a porcupine, in a box which just completely confuses things zoologically. In any event, there is a shipwreck, the Water Dragons seem none too friendly when first met, there are dragon-eating plants about and, worst of all, Oscar and Coconut have a disagreement. No one seems particularly worried about the fact that they’re all stranded on a desert island with no means of communicating with dragonkind across the water, but the ability to sing catchy little tunes about friendship sorts out everything. Altogether, this is a bit dull and baffling for anyone over the age of seven; but it’s largely inoffensive, maybe even laudable, with its relentlessly pro-tolerance happy-clappy message of love. I am still wondering why so many of the Fire Dragon characters are named after fruits while the Gourmet Dragons just have regular German names. And why is it called A Dragon’s Adventure (note the singular), instead of Dragons’ Adventure, since they all go on holiday, not just one dragon? • A Dragon’s Adventure is released on 2 April on digital platforms.",A Dragon’s Adventure,FILM
226,The Mauritanian review – in limbo in Guantánamo with Tahar Rahim,"When Nancy Hollander (Jodie Foster) arrives at Guantánamo Bay, she’s wearing sunglasses. Her chic white bob and blue button-down shirt are hardly provocative, but a guard advises her to wear a hijab anyway – the detainees have been known to spit at women. The moment recalls Foster’s trainee FBI agent Clarice Starling in The Silence of the Lambs, met with a different bodily fluid in the bowels of a psychiatric hospital. The Mauritanian, a post-9/11 legal drama based on Mohamedou Ould Slahi’s 2015 memoir Guantánamo Diary, is less concerned with the particular psychology of its incarcerated protagonist than with the political machinery that kept him behind bars without an official criminal charge for 14 years. The excellent Tahar Rahim (A Prophet) brings softness and seriousness to Slahi, but overripe flashbacks to his horrific torture are shot with a cartoonish edge. It’s a double bind: depict an interrogation scene too realistically and run the risk of torture porn, but veer too off-kilter and the effect is distancing. Here, the styling is at odds with the otherwise straightforward courtroom narrative. The prestige procedural elements work better; the real-life story is enraging, and it’s fun to see Benedict Cumberbatch’s morally conflicted military prosecutor lock horns with Foster’s icy human rights lawyer. • On Amazon Prime",The Mauritanian,FILM
227,Undine review – romance with just enough magic and mystery,"Writer-director Christian Petzold (Transit) riffs on the German myth of the water nymph whose love of a man secures her an immortal human soul. Undine (Paula Beer) is a historian in a leather jacket, her red hair recalling another Little Mermaid. “If you leave me, I’ll have to kill you,” she warns boyfriend Johannes (Jacob Matschenz), as per the fairytale. He dumps her anyway. Soon enough she has a new beau, a gorgeous industrial diver named Christoph (Franz Rogowski). The force of their initial attraction causes a fish tank to explode, soaking them to the skin. Undine gives lectures on Berlin’s changing architecture; this allows for neat parallels between a city haunted by the spectre of history and – like a gender-flipped Vertigo – our heroine tethered to the ghost of her past love. There’s just enough magic and mystery to tease out a supernatural reading of the film, though Petzold encourages viewers to find pleasure in puzzling out his femme fatale for themselves.

228,Red Carpet review – rap-themed escape story loses itself in grim detail,"Apart from Google Street View employees’ driveways, the LA “underbelly” must be the most filmed place on the planet, from Kiss Me Deadly to Training Day. That capital of spiritual degradation is where this scratchy low-budget drama is bound, as Angeleno wannabe Mandy (Wittie Hughes) meets-cute with a white-boy rapper on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and gets wrecked with him at a pool party. Mandy’s hopes of stardom take a nosedive when she wakes up on a plastic-sheathed mattress in an anonymous low-rise, apparently delivered into human slavery. She has become the “property” of Shadow, a tooth-grilled pimp who appears to have taken James Franco’s “Look at all my shit” soliloquy in Spring Breakers as sound career advice. His sidekick is a mute never seen without a gold Anonymous mask. Director Scott Altman keeps Mandy locked in her room and on strict exploitation-movie rations – she is raped, and cosies up to winsome fellow hooker Lola (Roshema Purfoy) for consolatory spliffs and lesbian cuddles. She alchemises the pain into rap, which finally provides her with a way out. Red Carpet buys hook, line and verse into LA rap romanticism, and at least looks the part: it makes handsome use of the drone technology that has democratised the establishing shot; it delivers at street level too, with a smeary digital aesthetic that is now the mandatory mode for shooting this languorous city. But the story is threadbare – resorting to rape far too often to manufacture incident – to seriously engage beyond lurid cliches. Red Carpet is at its best when it is swept up by its own vibe: Mandy gets lost in breakbeats as she dreams up misery-rhymes to soundtrack a break for freedom that, when it comes, unfolds like a rap video playing in her head. Red Carpet is released on 26 March on digital platforms.",Red Carpet,FILM
229,Citizen Lane review – dashed hopes of a visionary art dealer,"This Irish drama documentary feels like a contribution to ongoing efforts to guilt-trip the National Gallery in London into returning to Ireland more than three dozen French impressionist masterpieces bequeathed by the Irish art dealer Hugh Lane. When he wrote his will in 1913, stung by the Dublin authorities’ refusal to grant him planning permission to build a modern art gallery in the city, Lane left the 39 paintings to London. Later, he changed his mind, adding a codicil to his will. His intentions were as clear as day, but the codicil was unwitnessed. So, when he died aged 40 – travelling on the Lusitania, which was sunk by a German U-boat in 1915 – London got the paintings. The film opens with a bit of context, setting the mood in Ireland at the turn of the 1900s. This was the era of Irish cultural revival, WB Yeats and JM Synge, of Irish trade unionism and nationalism. The dramatised bits work pretty well. Tom Vaughan-Lawlor is terrific as Lane, an Irish Protestant, the self-made son of a clergyman. When he stares transfixed at a Titian, there is a blazing chemistry between man and painting. No other relationship can compete. In fact, Lane’s eye was so good that if he so much as looked at a painting before an auction its value shot up. Lane was a snob, but he believed in art for the people. His free-entry gallery in Dublin would have had a bridge over the Liffey, so that ordinary Dubliners would pass the Manets on their way to work. (“You may as well give strawberries to donkeys,” sneered a friend). The National Gallery in London asserts its strict legal rights over the painting, but Citizen Lane puts a convincing case that the moral right belongs to Dublin. (Too late for inclusion in the film, London and Dublin earlier this year reached a truce, agreeing to rotate a number of the paintings.) • Citizen Lane is released on 12 April on digital platforms.",Citizen Lane,FILM
230,"Those That, At a Distance, Resemble Another review – meditation on the art and act of copying","Artist and film-maker Jessica Sarah Rinland has authored a brief essay movie on the universal themes of the copy and the original. A copyist reproduces an original work of art, a museum conservator fabricates a damaged object with replacement materials. But the originals are arguably copies of ideas and genres within the artist’s mind, and the biological act of reproduction is an act of copying, from the DNA template. Rinland’s camera observes calmly, almost blankly, as the introduction of howler monkeys into the wild is discussed by zoologists – a habitat where they might breed – and this issue is juxtaposed with restoration work at the V&amp;A, the Natural History Museum and the British Museum in London. An elephant tusk is copied as a plaster cast; confiscated tusks are used to restore a 19th-century ivory box, antiquities are painstakingly brought back to a version of their fundamental selves. It is intricate, meticulous work and Rinland follows it nearly in real time; it is an almost experimental procedure, although a series of titles at the very end make it clear exactly what we have been watching. The film is pregnant with ideas: I found myself thinking of Jean Baudrillard’s writings about the “simulacrum”, about a world with Elvis impersonators but no Elvis. As the ivory box is slowly restored to an approximation of its old self, we have the leisure to consider that this is an activity not very different from making it the first time around: both are from the same prototype, and that the time-lapse between the two has, in some sense, been abolished. • Those That, at a Distance, Resemble Another is available on 6 April on Mubi.","Those That, At a Distance, Resemble Another",FILM
231,Workhorse review – beautiful but plodding paean to beasts of burden,"This painstakingly composed black and white documentary about jobbing horses and their employer-companions is perhaps easier to admire than love. On the plus side, the cinematography by Ryan A Randall – a mix of widescreen, immersive landscapes and startlingly stylised shots with inky backgrounds, slow-motion details, or unexpected angles – is consistently beautiful. It’s what truly draws the viewer into this up-close and personal account, directed by Cliff Caines, of three different businesses that use proper working horses, great big massive ones, to do jobs that are in two out of three cases more often done with machines. In the first study, a timberman in Canada uses his two steeds, cheeky Orlagh and stalwart Idaho, to fell and collect trunks, a logging method he insists is better for the forest. The relationship between the logger, who retires at the end of the segment, and his equine co-workers is so emotionally rich that the more workaday, people-centric subsequent sections pale in comparison somewhat. Really, this first bit works on its own as a short, but there’s still much of interest in the second part, about a farming family who use horse teams to plough their fields, and the third, about another family that put their horses through competitions to see which one can haul the most weight – which strictly speaking sounds less like work than sport. By the last half hour, Caines’s use of long, slow takes, and the film’s clippity-clop walking pace grows a little numbing. Also, while the film-makers’ respect for their subjects is manifest, and the people featured all seem like experienced, loving custodians who don’t beat their horses, the film rather takes the humans’ word for it that these animals love to work, having been bred for it over generations. Admittedly, the horses themselves have no means to dispute that assessment, but if they could talk, you rather wonder whether they’d be quite so enthusiastic about lugging farm equipment and huge trees all day long. • Workhorse is released on 9 April on True Story.",Workhorse,FILM
232,Songs My Brothers Taught Me review – Chloé Zhao's deeply intelligent debut,"In honour of Nomadland, the film from director Chloé Zhao that is set to dominate as the connoisseur-choice of this year’s awards season, here is a belated launch of her lovely feature debut from 2015, which never actually had a full release in the UK. I can’t believe it’s taken me this long to see it: some derivative, Malickian touches, yes, but like her other films, it’s a deeply intelligent and sympathetic rendering of real-life situations, using nonprofessionals playing approximations of themselves. The setting is the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota (the site of Wounded Knee creek, where the 1890 massacre of Lakota people took place); John Reddy and Jashaun St John play Johnny and Jashaun, a teen Lakota boy and his kid sister, whose lives are turned upside down when their absentee dad, a bronco rider, dies drunkenly in a fire. Johnny and Jashaun meet all their various half-siblings at the funeral. As Johnny says to his brother Cody (Justin Reddy), now in prison: “It’s as if he’s suddenly back in our lives, now that he’s gone … ain’t that funny?” This clarifies Johnny’s determination to move out of the “rez” and go to Los Angeles, where his aspirational girlfriend Aurelia (Taysha Fuller) is soon going to be a student at UCLA, living in dorms – and the plan is that Johnny somehow finds a job and a place to live, and they will live as a couple that way. Does Johnny believe in his own future? The sheer emotional hurt of Jashaun at being abandoned by her adored elder brother pulses through this film, and she has innocent adventures of her own: her presence gives the movie such warmth. Zhao’s authorial signature was obvious even then, and in just six years she has scaled amazing creative heights. • Songs My Brothers Taught Me is available on 9 April on Mubi.",Songs My Brothers Taught Me,FILM
233,Bittersweet Symphony review – pretty but fake-feeling family Christmas yarn,"The freewheeling improv style of Jamie Adams (who directed the daffy comedy Black Mountain Poets) hits a wall in his new film about a family Christmas in Wales. There are comedy scenes here that flatline and lightweight fake-feeling emotional moments. Model-actors Suki Waterhouse and Poppy Delevingne are the stars: they look pretty uncomfortable playing sisters visiting their folks for the holidays. Maybe it’s snarky to say, but with their gorgeous knitwear and expensive London accents, it’s hard to buy either of them dunking a Bourbon into a cuppa. Waterhouse is Iris, a flaky-quirky, beret-wearing film composer who has landed a massive gig writing the soundtrack for a big-time Hollywood movie. The trouble is she’s creatively stuck, and anxious about her mum who is dying of an unspecified terminal illness (fading gently propped up on pillows, no fuss). Iris’s sister, Abigail (Delevingne), is back too, and the suggestion is that this is their last family Christmas together. To cure Iris’s writer’s block, her agent flies in legendary American songwriter Eleanor Roberts (Dirty Dancing’s Jennifer Grey), who shows up clanking Jack Daniel’s bottles and jangling silver bangles. The two women connect instantly. Cue earnest lines (“You’ve got to be more than a pretty girl with a guitar”) and boring scenes of them writing songs. Eleanor is also clearly attracted to Iris. Bittersweet Symphony is a film with serious plausibility issues; none of the characters come across like real human beings. But it deserves points for a funnyish subplot that brings home how romcoms so often idealise stalkerish behaviour. Submarine actor Craig Roberts plays Iris’s idiot ex, who devises a series of stunts to prove how much he still loves her – like wrapping himself as a giant Christmas present. It definitely adds to the film. That said, the Onion did the same thing in a one-sentence headline: “Romantic-Comedy Behaviour Gets Real-Life Man Arrested.” • Bittersweet Symphony is released on 12 April on digital platforms.",Bittersweet Symphony,FILM
234,A Common Crime review – chilling ghost story with a social conscience,"Guilt and the return of the repressed are behind this elegant, disquieting and impressively acted political ghost story from Argentinian film-maker Francisco Márquez. Cecilia (Elisa Carricajo) is a sociology professor and single mother of a little boy, Juan (Ciro Coien Pardo); she is very successful, though on edge about her recent application for an academic promotion. Cecilia gets on well with her maid Nebe (Mecha Martinez) but is made very uncomfortable when Nebe brings round her teenage son Kevin (Eliot Otazo). Kevin seems dour, unsmiling, perhaps with learning difficulties. In the middle of a stormy night, Cecilia is awoken by a terrifying banging at the door, preceded by an eerie dreamlike voice murmuring “Cecilia” in her ear. Peering through the shutters, she can see it is Kevin and is too scared to open up. The next morning, she sees on the news that Kevin’s body has been found in the river, with protesters alleging he was chased down and killed by the police – one of the state’s “common crimes” directed at the poor. Cecilia can’t bring herself to confess to Nebe that she could have helped her son, or tell any of her colleagues. And so she begins to crack under the terrible strain of maintaining this secret along with the day-to-day tasks of her sophisticated and successful intellectual life, believing Kevin has come back to haunt her. As well as a comment on Argentina’s present, A Common Crime is about its past: Kevin has been “disappeared”, like dissidents under the junta. And when Cecilia is late for work one day it makes her head of department very nervous – he is old enough to remember that when certain academics were “late”, they never showed up at all. There are points of comparison here with other films – the Dardennes’ The Unknown Girl, for example, or Lucrecia Martel’s The Headless Woman – and the junta killings arguably play the same role here as France’s “nuit noire”, the notorious 1961 police slaughter of Algerian protesters, in Michael Haneke’s Hidden. But Márquez brings his own distinctive touch and Carricajo is excellent; she shows us how, with so much at stake and with a lifetime’s adult experience at putting on a good show and presenting as perfectly fine, a prosperous middle-class professional can swallow a guilty secret and carry on. But the tiny poison symptoms inevitably begin to surface. A smart piece of work. • A Common Crime is released on 9 April on digital platforms.",A Common Crime,FILM
235,Sequin in a Blue Room review – electrifying foray into online hookup culture,"Boldly declaring itself a “homosexual film”, Sequin in a Blue Room is neither coy nor moralistic about online gay hookup culture. The apps have a toxic side, yes, but the film also acutely understands the heady, tactile pleasure of casual sex. Despite the thriller aesthetics, Sequin in a Blue Room is at its heart a coming-of-age tale in a digital world filled with instant sexual gratifications and perilous risks. The film is, in one word, hot; rippling with an electrifying sexual energy. The anonymity is key. Even the 16-year-old protagonist, played by Conor Leach, has no name. He is known only as Sequin, a display name on a hookup app where he procures no-strings sex from much older men. With cut-glass cheekbones, Sequin is striking and arrogantly cocksure of the power attached to such assets. The silvery, sequin-encrusted crop-top reserved for his trysts only enhances the detached precocity. Nevertheless, Sequin’s walls come tumbling down when he finds himself at an anonymous sex party called the Blue Room. The scene pulsates with carnal desires and a hint of danger. Bathed in a dazzling blue light, indiscernible bodies writhe to hypnotic electronic music, while Sequin enjoys an intense encounter with another man. As lust ignites what feels like love, Sequin searches for his unidentified hookup, only to get entangled in a web of lies, manipulation and predation. That Sequin in a Blue Room was director Samuel van Grinsven’s graduate project is astonishing considering the film’s inspired visual panache, and the eroticism of the explicit depictions of casual sex. Leach’s performance in his first film acting credit is equally impressive; the way in which Sequin’s swagger gradually drains from his face to expose an inner vulnerability is incredibly moving. With such an impressive debut, Van Grinsven is surely one to watch. • Sequin in a Blue Room is released on 9 April on digital platforms.",Sequin in a Blue Room,FILM
236,I’m Not in Love review – anti-romcom that nails sex and dating,"Shot in and around London’s Hampstead and Belsize Park areas, this quirky anti-romantic comedy revolves around thirtysomething nutritionist Rob (likably schlubby Al Weaver), an ordinary bloke who can’t quite bring himself to commit, and his longsuffering long-term girlfriend Marta (Cristina Catalina). Keenly aware of how little time is left on her biological clock and desperate to have a baby, she stands by virtually tapping her foot while she waits for him to propose, or at least agree to get her knocked up. Rob, meanwhile, surveys the wildly contradictory advice he gets from his eclectic assortment of male friends. Some, particularly the ones already paired up and reproducing, counsel Rob to settle for Marta and stop looking for the perfect woman because no one will be that girl. Rob secretly wants to be more of a player like his friend Chris (Morgan Watkins), a smoothie who looks like a better version of Rob – but who is suffering from erectile dysfunction problems and has a growing interest in seeing escorts because it’s “more honest”. It would be so easy for this film to end up leaving a bitter taste in the mouth, but writer-director Col Spector is trying to work up something that is essentially more honest than the usual romcom. The gags don’t always land, and some of the line deliveries plod painfully on, but there are moments that nail the strange comedy of sexual manners that must be navigated these days; is it appropriate, for example, to pull your date out of a threesome if they’re clearly enjoying themselves and want to stay? The depressed clarinet soundtrack gets a bit irritating after a while, but on the whole it’s not at all bad, and John Henshaw’s cameo as one of Rob’s disgruntled patients is a particular treat. • I’m Not in Love is released on 12 April on digital platforms.",I’m Not in Love,FILM
237,Jules Verne’s Rocket to the Moon review - genial 60s British wacky-space-racers,"There’s an serious outbreak of top hats and mutton chops in this amiable adaptation of Jules Verne’s From the Earth to the Moon, originally released in 1967, when the real world was gearing up for the Apollo moonshot a couple of years later. Produced by the prolific Harry Towers, it adopted the rambling wacky-races format that had proved enduringly popular throughout the 1950s and 60s; most recently with the 1965 hit Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines, which it shamelessly capitalised on with its US title (Those Fantastic Flying Fools) as well as redeplying the ubiquitous Terry-Thomas, who played yet another moustache-twirling cad. Rocket to the Moon is watchable in a bored-Sunday-afternoon sort of way: it’s about whether an international consortium, led by Burl Ives (as Phineas T Barnum) and Dennis Price, can successfully build a giant cannon into the side of a mountain that can fire a human missile up to the moon, using a radical new form of gunpowder. Terry-Thomas is the chief meanie, with inventor brother-in-law Lionel Jeffries; Troy Donahue plays a dashing balloonist who lands in the middle of it all. Conceived on a relatively large scale for a British film of the period, it’s hampered somewhat by the fact there is no actual race to speak of, as well as the necessity of expanding scenes for some of the actors to placate international financing. Some of the material, it’s safe to say, has not dated well: particularly the jokes at the expense of Tom Thumb (Jimmy Clitheroe), and the dumb-ditz scenes given to Israeli actor Daliah Lavi. There’s a certain steampunk energy on show but it’s otherwise pretty good-natured, offering the mostly undemanding spectacle of people falling off penny-farthing bicycles or crashing into haystacks.

And it’s grim deprivation that student nurse Val (Rose Williams) walks into on her first day on the wards of an east London hospital in this feminist horror; her first patient is a little girl with rickets and stunted growth. Written and directed by Corinna Faith, this film is a real screw-tightener, ingeniously set during the miners’ strike in January 1974. What could be scarier than the lights going out in a Victorian hospital in the dead of night? When Val arrives most of the patients are being transferred to another hospital for the night because of a scheduled power cut. Val is on the “dark shift” – staying to cover two wards kept going by a generator. She is too embarrassed to admit that she’s scared of the dark, triggered by childhood abuse in a care home. Pretty soon Val is clinging to the corridor walls, groping her way in the dark – and that’s even before things go bang in the night. There are cracking lines in the script; unexpectedly, some of them very funny. In the staff room, an Irish nurse is reading Stephen King’s Carrie (not actually published until three months later, in April). “It’s about a girl who’s had enough and burns it all down,” jokes the nurse. And what follows is like Carry on Carrie – or maybe more Carry on Exorcist. Val becomes possessed by a demonic power. Or is she experiencing a psychotic episode? Either way, the bodies are piling up as a result of masculinity (in the hospital and elsewhere) that’s so toxic it’s literally contaminating everything. After a bit of a damp start, the scares are merciless. Demonically possessed characters convulsing are ten a penny in horror movies, but Val’s limbs twist like she’s a doll being yanked by a spiteful toddler. It’s unbearable to see in places, especially since Val has already suffered so much. Now some kind of malevolent force is taking over her body, another violation. Empowerment for female victims comes late in the day too, making this a raw and painful watch. • The Power is released on 8 April on Shudder.",The Power,FILM
239,Regé-Jean Page ‘hurt’ to learn race was factor in rejection from Superman show,"The actor Regé-Jean Page has addressed reports he was turned down for a leading role in the superhero TV series Krypton because of his skin colour. “Multiple sources” cited by the Hollywood Reporter earlier this week suggested the producers of Krypton – an origins series focused on Superman’s grandfather – were “passionate about doing some nontraditional casting” when recruiting for the show, which ran for two seasons starting in 2018. This reportedly led to Page landing an audition, until his possible appointment was vetoed by Geoff Johns, the co-founder of DC Films, who said Superman “could not have a black grandfather”. Tweeting on Wednesday evening, Page wrote: “Hearing about these conversations hurts no less now than it did back then. The clarifications almost hurt more tbh. Still just doing my thing. Still we do the work. We still fly.” In a statement to E! News, a representative for Johns said his client felt fans would expect Superman’s grandfather, , “to look like a young Henry Cavill”, referring to the actor who most recently played Superman on the big screen. They continued: “Geoff never said Superman can’t have a black ancestor or be black – there have been diverse versions of Superman throughout the comics for decades so he does and can be diverse. “However, the expectation for Krypton was that it would initially be perceived as a possible prequel to Man of Steel by the fans and the lead was expected to invoke a young Henry Cavill.” Page’s decision to leave the hit Netflix show Bridgerton after one series has surprised many and led to numerous rumours about possible next roles for the actor, who recently hosted Saturday Night Live. He is the current favourite to replace Daniel Craig as James Bond, following the release of No Time to Die in September. Some reports have also attached him to the Black Panther series. Although the title role is not thought to be up for grabs, following the death of star Chadwick Boseman last August, director Ryan Coogler and Marvel producers are said to be eager to expand the roster of characters whose stories would be explored in future films.",Regé-Jean Page,PERFORMER
240,Night in Paradise review – operatic Korean display of gunfire and death,"This gleefully blood-splattered Korean gangster film with an unlikely romantic subplot looks for most of its running time like the sort of cult-friendly genre discovery one could watch and then crow over before an inevitable Hollywood remake comes out. That said, the ending is so relentlessly bleak that a faithful remake would be unlikely – while an unfaithful one with a happier conclusion would be absurd given the ruthless logic of writer-director Park Hoon-jung’s plotting. The initiating setup is that after something really bad happens, moody pretty-boy gangster Tae-Gu (Eom Tae-goo) must hide out on a resort island in off-season before he is ultimately resettled in Vladivostok, Russia. En route he stays with a grumpy arms dealer, a former gangster himself, and that man’s troubled, taciturn niece Jae-Yeon (Jeon Yeo-been). But it soon transpires that there’s hidden depths in both Jae-Yeon and Tae-Gu, who after the de rigueur initial verbal sparring become unlikely friends – and maybe potential soul mates, especially when they end up bonding over their shared affection for mulhoe, a spicy raw fish soup which plays a significant role in the story. In fact, there are a lot of meals throughout, discussions of who is hungry and a key plot-furthering sit-down among gangsters in a restaurant that involves one of those huge rotating trivets typical of Korean restaurants so that people can share dishes more easily. This is not a film to watch on an empty stomach, both because the food looks great and those of a delicate disposition might, like one of the gangsters, feel a little nauseous after the gory bits. Leisurely pacing rather draws it all out a bit, but there’s real inventiveness to the way Park wrong-foots the viewer and handles the operatic displays of gunfire and death – and the leads are rather charming. • Night in Paradise is released on 9 April on Netflix.",Night in Paradise,FILM
241,The Frightened City review – crooks and coppers in a classic London noir,"There’s a blue-chip cast for this tasty 1961 Brit noir, a brash and brassy mob drama in the bright lights of London’s Soho and the West End – the world of Dassin’s Night and the City. Alfred Marks plays Harry Foulcher, a creepy club owner whose supposedly legitimate business is a front for a protection racket, putting the arm on smalltime pubs and dives for a tenner a week. His crooked accountant Waldo Zhernikov, played with gorgeous insinuation by Herbert Lom, persuades Harry to sit down with all the other cauliflower-eared villains to form a profitable London-wide syndicate, to the disgust of the hard-nosed honest copper Detective Inspector Sayers, robustly played by John Gregson. These gangsters need a cool tough guy to collect the larger sums coming in, so they recruit a cat burglar called Paddy Damion, an ordinary decent criminal who needs the money … played by pre-007 Sean Connery. It’s richly enjoyable stuff and the early-60s London locations are a treat. As so often with this kind of movie, there’s fascination in the quaint club scenes: the racy, naughty, semi-unclothed floor shows in Soho establishments that are frequented by posh gentlemen who like to slum it, the sort of place where someone like Stephen Ward or John Profumo were to be found in Michael Caton-Jones’s Scandal (1989). Waldo has a young woman in whom he takes an almost Ward-like platonic interest: a Russian singer called Anya (Yvonne Romain) who warbles away at the grand piano that Waldo preposterously has in a room adjoining his office. Anya is to fall in love, naturally, with Connery. It’s all good stuff with some ripe cameos to be savoured by Talking Pictures TV fans. The Frightened City also happens to be the film debut of Stephen Lewis, then credited as Stephen Cato, playing a lanky young Brummie thug – later to be seen playing Blakey in TV’s On the Buses. • The Frightened City is available on 12 April on Blu-ray, DVD and digital platforms.",The Frightened City,FILM
242,Palm Springs review – amusing time-loop romance is back … again,"It’s possible to imagine a sci-fi nightmare about someone waking up in a world where every film they watch turns out to be a different remake of Groundhog Day – until that person fixes some awful sadness or wrongness or selfishness in their life. Only then can they sit down to a film and realise with a smile of inexpressible relief that it isn’t a bittersweet comedy about being trapped in a time-loop. Credits. It’s a credit to LA musician-turned-screenwriter Andy Siara that he has managed to make this time-loop film so ingenious, so good-natured and so funny, hurdling the inevitable deja-vu objections. We awaken in a luxury hotel resort at which Nyles, played by Andy Samberg, is a wedding guest, along with girlfriend Misty (Meredith Hagner) who is a maid-of-honour, and with whom Nyles has a sexual problem all too horribly indicative of his current cosmic situation. At the ceremony, Nyles is bleary, drunk and cheerfully disengaged, but at the reception party he finds a connection with the bride’s lonely, unhappy sister Sarah (Cristin Milioti, who played Teresa, the first wife of Jordan Belfort in The Wolf of Wall Street). They ditch the party to be alone together, but come into traumatic contact with another important person in Nyles’s life, a murderously angry old guy called Mike (JK Simmons), and Sarah is to realise the awful fix Nyles has got her into. Samberg is probably the only actor who could have sold this film’s premise to us so effortlessly and Peter Pannishly. As a performer, Samberg is a living cartoon of casual comic precision. He is 42 years old, but looks no older than he did when I first saw him in the 2007 comedy Hot Rod, plausibly playing a kid far younger than his then late twentysomething self. He maybe has a portrait of Paul Rudd in his attic (or it could be the other way around). Palm Springs was a smash at this year’s Sundance film festival, and people said it was because lockdown has made time-loops fashionable … again. But they are a perennially potent film subject. As for Palm Springs, it delivers some much-needed laughs. I’d like to watch it again. • Palm Springs is released on 9 April on Amazon Prime Video.",Palm Springs,FILM
243,Phoebe Waller-Bridge joins new Indiana Jones movie,"Phoebe Waller-Bridge is set to join Harrison Ford in the fifth Indiana Jones movie. The Emmy-winning star and creator of Fleabag will appear in as-yet-unconfirmed role in the latest instalment of the hit adventure franchise. Steven Spielberg, who had directed the previous chapters, will hand over the reins to James Mangold, whose recent credits include Logan and Ford v Ferrari. The director previously stated that he wanted to “pass along Indy’s whip to a new generation to bring their perspective to the story”. Spielberg will remain a producer along with Kathleen Kennedy, Frank Marshall and Simon Emanuel. “I’m thrilled to be starting a new adventure, collaborating with a dream team of all-time great film-makers,” Mangold said in a statement. “Steven, Harrison, Kathy, Frank, and John are all artistic heroes of mine. When you add Phoebe, a dazzling actor, brilliant creative voice and the chemistry she will undoubtedly bring to our set, I can’t help but feel as lucky as Indiana Jones himself.” The film follows 2008’s Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull which received mixed reviews but made over $790m worldwide. It’s set to be the 78-year-old Ford’s final film as the adventurer. “We’ve seen the character develop and grow over a period of time and it’s perfectly appropriate and OK for him to come back again with a great movie around him,” Ford said back in 2013. Waller-Bridge scored acclaim and awards for her two-season comedy drama Fleabag and has franchise experience having starred in Solo: A Star Wars Story and working on the script for the upcoming 007 thriller No Time to Die. The multi-hyphenate was also recently attached to a Mr and Mrs Smith reboot series alongside Donald Glover.

245,Thunder Force review – Melissa McCarthy gets superstrength in rote superhero comedy,"Melissa McCarthy’s moderate new superhero comedy vehicle stars McCarthy opposite Octavia Spencer, and is written and directed by her husband, Ben Falcone, who has a cameo as a hapless henchman called Kenny – the subject of what may or may not be a South Park gag. In an alternate universe where the US is threatened by super-villains called Miscreants, Lydia (McCarthy) is a big-hearted kid from Chicago who in high school protects a super-smart girl called Emily from bullies; they become best friends who lose touch in adulthood. Lydia grows up to be a lonely, boozy worker in a packing plant but Emily – now played by Octavia Spencer – becomes a tech zillionaire developing genetic treatments to turn ordinary people into superheroes. When Lydia drunkenly blunders into Emily’s lab, insisting on taking her to a class reunion, she accidentally plugs herself into the equipment and gives herself super-strength. And so exasperated high-achiever Emily figures they might as well team up to form Thunder Force, battling a Miscreant called Laser (Pom Klementieff – Mantis, from the Marvel Cinematic Universe), together with a bad guy called the King (Bobby Cannavale) and his associate the Crab, someone with pincers for arms – a role for Jason Bateman that again proves Bateman’s comically self-aware likability has never worked as well as it did in the role of Michael Bluth in TV’s Arrested Development. As ever, the comedy is mostly in the premise and the opening act when the heroine’s still-pristine loser status activates the irony and the laughs. From there on, the action needs a growing measure of seriousness, although there is some banter between the King, the Crab and the cringing henchmen subordinates, and a nice role for Marcella Lowery as Emily’s mum, hoping that Emily and Lydia might be a couple. This is by-the-numbers stuff, not quite funny enough for comedy or having enough of the crazed seriousness that marks out a successful superhero franchise. • Thunder Force is out on 9 April on Netflix.",Thunder Force,FILM
246,Palm Springs review – Groundhog Day with wedding bells on,"It’s an unexceptional wedding. Perhaps the cocktail bar aesthetic is a touch on the cheesy side. Perhaps there are a few sexual misadventures. Certainly a lot of beer is consumed, most of it by Nyles (Andy Samberg, excellent in a role that harnesses his comic talent but hones it into a performance of unexpected depth). But what is unusual is the location, next to a portal that leads to what Nyles nonchalantly describes as “one of those infinite time loops you might have heard of”. It’s a sly nod to the fact that cinema has been caught in this particular high concept before. But surface similarities to Groundhog Day are relegated to background noise, thanks to the crisp writing and the nihilistic bite of the humour. When we join the wedding, Nyles has already been caught in the loop for long enough to have relinquished hope and any pretence of giving a damn. But the endless inevitability is disrupted when Sarah (Cristin Milioti), sister of the bride and a velvet-eyed car crash of a woman, is sucked into the same repeated day. And the infinite grind of repetition suddenly takes on an element of fun. An insouciance of approach is evident in the film’s synthetic colour palette of Hawaiian shirt primaries and visual gags, such as the yin and yang placement of two inflatable pizza slices in a pool. But there are weightier themes. It’s a film about fatalism versus fierce and emphatic free will; settling versus risking it all. Covid brings an added resonance: what is true love, after all, if not actively aching to spend time with the person with whom you’ve been flung together for what seems like an eternity?

247,Sequin in a Blue Room review – illicit thrills in gay coming-of-age story,"Sequin (the remarkably assured Conor Leach) is 16, but adds two years to his age to buy entry into an adult world of covert gay hookups. The no-strings connections he scrolls through on his phone during his English lessons exert a fascination which is thrillingly illicit; infinitely more exciting than the option of dates with lovesick boys his own age. Sequin’s only rule is that he never meets anyone twice. Then he encounters a handsome stranger in an anonymous sex party – located in the throbbing blue room of the title – and his quest to find the man reveals that, for all his poised appeal, Sequin is out of his depth. This feature debut from the Sydney-based writer and director Samuel Van Grinsven may tackle familiar material – gay coming-of-age stories are hardly uncommon – but it does so with a lustre and style that marks Van Grinsven out as a name to watch. Perhaps even more notable is Leach, a silky, feline presence who owns every moment that he’s on screen. On multiple VOD and virtual cinema platforms",Sequin in a Blue Room,FILM
248,For the Sake of Vicious review – ugly home-invasion thriller whose title says it all,"Ultraviolence is too often seen as a cinematic end in itself – but the results are often ugly, boring, or both. This Canadian home-invasion thriller falls into this trap, so ferociously focused on the scent of blood that it double-kneecaps one character not once but twice: by hammer, then by gunshot. But given that co-director Gabriel Carrer’s past credits include Kill, The Demolisher, and Death on Scenic Drive, we probably shouldn’t be expecting The Bridges of Madison County here. The film starts as a mysterious and alarmingly claustrophobic three-hander: nurse Romina (Lora Burke) knocks off a long Halloween shift and comes home to find that wild-eyed Chris (Nick Smyth) has taken her landlord Alan (Colin Paradine) hostage. Chris claims Alan raped his daughter five years ago; the courts let it slide, and he wants to extract the confession that will justify him taking the ultimate revenge. “This kitchen is not a courthouse, and I am not a clerk,” says Romina. But adjudicating the truth is exactly what she must do – potentially enraging Chris, on the shortest of leashes and who may be projecting his own misdeeds on the man hogtied to a chair. Sadly, when Alan manages to call in outside help, the film drops this high-tension triangle and lets slip the dogs of gore. This squanders some impressively unhinged acting by Smyth, alternating between a rigid thousand-mile stare and surges of raving abandon that suggest an out-of-body experience. One early, promising scene in which Sarah resuscitates Alan with one hand while sweet-talking her son on the phone with the other showcases all the tension lost in the glassy-eyed – and sometimes illogically staged – bloodbath that takes over. The daft title tries to promise splatterhouse brazenness, but actually fesses up to the film’s lack of imagination. For the Sake of Vicious is released on 19 April on digital platforms.",For the Sake of Vicious,FILM
249,Sensation review – sensory hacking thriller comes on like a Tesco Value Matrix,"This sci-fi-laced British thriller, from Czech director Martin Grof, aims for lofty metaphysical heights but trips over its own feet. Next to the films it draws from, it’s like a Tesco Value version of The Matrix, or as if Inception was taking place in the mind of a lobotomy patient. On a tiny budget, it’s no disgrace to fall short of these illustrious inspirations, but Sensation never recovers from the fact that Grof – co-writing with Magdalena Drahovska – seems unable to tidily convey its central premise. Looking to delve into his family history, postman Andrew (Game of Thrones’ Eugene Simon) has his DNA sequenced – but is told that he is part of an elite cohort of humans with hyper-acute sensory perception. Arm-twisted into joining a training group of similarly gifted individuals at a country house retreat, he learns that his sensitivity leaves him vulnerable to having his senses “hacked” and input with false information. Cue nested realities in which, under the tutelage of an adept (Jennifer Martin) cribbed from the Wachowskis’ Woman in a Red Dress, Andrew must learn to distinguish the real from the illusory. And also to manipulate the senses of other operatives involved in some kind of global conspiracy – something nodded to in a prologue put together with as much clarity as Kanye West’s political programme. This already convoluted setup bamboozles further as it picks up speed. It’s suggested that some of the students specialise in different senses, but apart from Andrew (hearing, smell) it’s not clear who does what, and neither are the rules of how everyone interacts. If these sensorial hallucinations are entirely fake and imposed, how can some aspects be true? What’s the point of learning to dupe others if it only affects a minuscule subsection of the population? Periodic catchups from Lady Exposition (AKA Nadia, another frosty teacher, played by Emily Wyatt) fail to enlighten. Grof at least does handle the transitions between realities reasonably inventively, making good use of the ever-more-unreal City of London. There is a certain Cartesian buzz to be had from Sensation if you abandon all hope of following the plot, and let it wash over you. But that won’t help when it tries to land a final twist that is supposed to bend minds, but is more likely to exhaust patience. • Sensation is available on 16 April on digital platforms.",Sensation,FILM
250,Be Good or Be Gone review – sharp Dublin crime thriller with deadpan charm,"This ultra-low-budget feature about working-class cousins on temporary release from Dublin’s Mountjoy prison feels a bit like the sort of sketchy, acoustic-sharp Irish black comedy that Lenny Abrahamson (Adam &amp; Paul, Garage) or Martin McDonagh (from the In Bruges period) made in their early years, before they went electric and found mega-fame Stateside directing the likes of Room and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. That’s a high compliment, and possibly a teensy bit more than Be Good or Be Gone deserves, given it’s a smidge trite and over-the-top in places – but it definitely has spark. Its strongest suit is the chemistry between Les Martin (who also co-wrote the script with Paul Murphy) and impish master of deadpan Declan Mills, who play Ste and Weed respectively They’re ordinary types from Dublin’s rougher zones who, in the case of Ste, blew the chance of a sporting career by getting sucked into the world of drugs and crime. Ste’s mistakes ended up costing an old friend his life, and it looks likely things will never be right with his girlfriend Dee (Jenny Lee Masterson, bringing nuance to a thinly written role), the mother of his too-cute-to-be-true moppet of a daughter Ellie May (Grace Cahill, admittedly adorable). Consequently, Ste has at least got himself clean and off the skag, but the same can’t be said for Weed, who when we first meet him is wondering if he can smuggle heroin out of prison just to make sure he’ll have a supply. Even so, Weed has ambitions to become a high-fashion designer and is already practising how he’d walk the catwalk for his post-show bow. This is amusing because he looks and sounds just like all the other smackheads in track pants they meet, and is clearly on the wrong side of 35 to break into fashion – but nevertheless, he’s keeping an eye on those stars while lying in his gutter bed. Over the course of their sojourn outside the walls of Mountjoy, the two confront their past, get involved in an armed robbery and are brutalised by former associates looking to collect debts. Some of the side characters are a little too self-consciously quirky-cute, and it’s all tied up a bit too neatly, but this definitely has charm. • Be Good or Be Gone is released on 13 April on digital platforms.",Be Good or Be Gone,FILM
251,Effie Gray review – Emma Thompson’s entertaining take on a doomed Victorian marriage,"One of John Ruskin’s many achievements was single-handedly creating a modern academic industry with the ambiguous way he described his unconsummated marriage to his young Scottish bride Euphemia “Effie” Gray. In the course of legal correspondence connected to their divorce, the great Victorian critic claimed there were “circumstances in her person” which disgusted him. Did that mean her pubic hair? Was he just reacting hysterically to her general nakedness? Was she eating chips in bed? Either way, Ruskin launched a million PhDs on Victorian sexuality, and now Emma Thompson has written an unexpectedly entertaining movie about this marital disaster and Gray’s subsequent romance with the painter John Everett Millais. It’s a little hammy and soapy, with an occasional Pythonesque sense of its own importance but this film, directed by Richard Laxton, is performed with gusto. As Effie herself, Dakota Fanning carries off the role competently, though with the American actor’s habit of playing British accents too slowly. Greg Wise does a good villainous turn as the obnoxious Ruskin: an obtuse and petulant Casaubon creep with a possible abuser’s taste for the green and unripe flesh. Julie Walters steals every scene as Ruskin’s overbearing mother, who turns Effie’s early married life into a grisly Rebecca nightmare.

252,I Blame Society review – film-maker turns serial killer in uneven black comedy,"Here’s a self-conscious black comedy from LA film-maker Gillian Wallace Horvat which is precariously balanced on the funny/annoying fulcrum. As Mickey Rooney might have said to Judy Garland: “Let’s make the quirky low-budget film about the ordeal of making quirky low-budget films right here!” Horvat plays a droll version of herself, also called Gillian; her politically contentious script about Israel fails to get funding so she falls back on an idea she’s had on the backburner for a while: a film about how great she’d be as a serial killer. Gillian feels that the manipulative and predatory talents she has as a director are the perfect murderer skillset. Or is it that the nightmare of film-making fills her with murderous rage, along with the resentful rage she already feels towards a certain young woman she nicknames “Stalin”? Heaven knows, her career is at an impasse. Gillian’s manager isn’t interested in her, and she is forced to take meetings with obnoxious film bros who call her work “Weird Frances Ha”. (Not entirely inaccurate, incidentally.) So using hidden cameras, and developing an unlikely talent for burglary, Gillian shoots a snuff-horror odyssey on spec in which she stars as a real-life killer. And sometimes this film is genuinely quite funny – especially when Gillian fastidiously breaks into someone’s apartment and effectively dresses the set to be a movie crime scene. She also picks up a homeless person and asks him if he’s ever been on a film set before. “I thought you might be a former child star or something.” At first meandering, the film does have a kind of sociopath narrative arc as Gillian becomes more adept and confident at killing, although the no-budget aesthetic gets it into difficulties – there appears to be a continuity issue when two different characters wear the exact same T-shirt. Despite the title, Gillian doesn’t blame society. Unapologetic from first to last, she clearly doesn’t think “blame” is relevant. • I Blame Society is released on 19 April on digital platforms.",I Blame Society,FILM
253,Auggie review – watchable hi-tech satire doesn’t quite know what to say,"The face of American character actor Richard Kind – melancholy, hangdog, a little dyspeptic – is exactly right for this high-concept midlife satire from director and co-writer Matt Kane. It’s a variation on a familiar theme the time is the near future and Kind plays Felix, an architect in his 60s who has been pushed out of the firm he helped build and is now at home grumpily adjusting to unwanted retirement. His busy wife and grownup daughter have no great need of him these days so poor, emasculated Felix takes comfort in his hi-tech retirement gift: a pair of “Auggie” glasses, through which the wearer can see an “augmented reality companion”, a virtual-reality hologram of exactly the kind of submissively understanding person your subconscious wants to see – in Felix’s case, an extremely attractive young woman (played by newcomer Christen Harper). Felix understands that this is just a projection, a geisha hallucination programmed to respond with the right answers and expressions. But inevitably he begins to fall in love with her, and toys with the “extra” that Auggie owners are invited to purchase: a pair of hi-tech underpants that will allow him to feel his Auggie companion intimately, while his wife is out all day at her prestigious job. This is a movie comparable to Spike Jonze’s Her, in which Joaquin Phoenix falls in love with the Siri-type computer voice played by Scarlett Johansson, and Alex Garland’s Ex Machina, in which Domhnall Gleeson is entranced by the AI robot played by Alicia Vikander; and like those films it creates a dreamy mood of indulgent comedy. Auggie is squeamish about straying into out-and-out nightmare or complete black-comic absurdity, and in fact it isn’t as interesting as Michael Almereyda’s Marjorie Prime with Jon Hamm as the VR hologram of an elderly woman’s late husband, recreated in his younger years. Maybe inevitably, this movie doesn’t quite know where to go after the initial premise, but Kind is watchable as the self-pitying and pathetic Felix. • Auggie is released on 19 April on digital platforms.",Auggie,FILM
254,Henry Glassie: Field Work review – hypnotic glimpses of folk art in the making,"There’s an unmistakable slow-cinema vibe to this scrupulously observational documentary, which seems somehow to go on for weeks despite its 100-minute running time. The ostensible subject matter is American anthropologist Henry Glassie, who is college professor emeritus in folklore and ethnomusicology at Indiana University; but it isn’t really “about” him in any conventional sense. Instead, the documentary, directed by Irish film-maker Pat Collins, invites us to experience Glassie’s methods for ourselves, in extended sequences in which it simply watches artists at work, seemingly in real time as they sculpt religious icons, build giant coil pots, weave carpets. The accent is very much on “folk” creators – people with little formal art education, rooted in a community, and whose work is (largely) to serve a function, rather than purely aesthetic. Well, it’s fascinating and hypnotic to watch, and for most of the film Glassie, with his luxuriant Mark Twain moustache, is glimpsed only briefly, sitting in the corner of the frame, taking notes, or snapping the odd picture, or, like us, simply watching. The film follows in his decades-old tracks, starting off with Brazilian metal workers and woodcarvers, visits an Anatolian village that makes traditional rugs, and ends up in County Fermanagh where, in the 70s, Glassie recorded the history and music of this border community. The film also stops off in Glassie’s original stomping ground in Appalachia, but it’s a little hard to equate the current inhabitants – slickly professional ceramicists occupying top-of-the-range wooden shed workshops – with the down-at-heel creatives elsewhere. Glassie does, eventually, outline what motivates him, and his love for both witnessing the creative process and mapping the communities where it takes place is evident in what he himself describes as his “terrible sincerity”. “I don’t study people,” he says. “I stand with people and study the things they create.” His watchwords, he adds, are “reverence and patience” – both qualities, I suspect, that you will need to get the most out of this brave, unusual film. • Henry Glassie: Field Work is released on 16 April on digital platforms.",Henry Glassie: Field Work,FILM
255,Veins of the World review – arresting portrait of nomadic life,"Veins of the World sees Mongolian director Byambasuren Davaa, whose debut, The Story of the Weeping Camel, earned an Oscar nomination for best documentary, again turn her evocative, naturalistic lens on to the lives of nomadic tribes in her home country. It’s something of a pity that, having made its festival rounds, the film gets its release during the pandemic, as its arresting, expansive portraiture of Mongolian rural landscapes would have made an indelible impact on the big screen. Right from the beginning, an alluringly green vista takes over the frame; the potency of the land is breathtaking. Nevertheless, amid this poetic lushness, barren patches slowly appear. Not only the fertile soil but also a traditional way of life is in danger of being eaten away. Shattering changes are seen through the eyes of 11-year-old Amra (Bat-Ireedui Batmunkh), who is especially close to his mechanic father, Erdene (Yalalt Namsrai); Erdene leads his fellow nomads in their resistance against the encroachments of mining companies. Unfortunately, tragedy strikes and Amra’s childlike innocence hardens into a resolute determination as he becomes a one-boy-army against the destructive forces of modern commerce. With a location as awe-inspiring as the Gobi desert, there’s always a danger that the setting will overshadow the drama, but Batmunkh’s committed performance is an emotional anchor that keeps the film clear of maudlin abstraction. Though dealing with overexploitation on a giant scale – these mining operations have even emptied rivers – Veins of the World is more interested in documenting the rituals of nomadic life. Amra visits the holy shaman tree, which bears witness not only to the child’s familial trauma but also to the damage being wreaked daily on his ancestral land; this tenderness renders the desecration of the environment even more heartless and shocking. Though perhaps naive in its understanding of systematic exploitation, Veins of the World is intimate and sweeping all at once, and has at its core a sincerity that invites genuine empathy. •Veins of the World is available on 13 April on YourScreen.",Veins of the World,FILM
256,Belarus culture workers need our support after detention of Tatsiana Hatsura-Yavorskaya | Mark Cousins,"The arrest in Belarus of the director of Minsk’s Watch Docs festival of nonfiction cinema is a reminder of how much culture workers matter in authoritarian states and at times of information deficit. On 5 April Tatsiana Hatsura-Yavorskaya’s home was searched by security forces, phones and computers were confiscated, and she was arrested. The ostensible reason was that she had co-organised (with Natalia Trenina and Yulya Semenchenko, who were also arrested but since released) an exhibition called The Machine Is Breathing, I Am Not about Belarus health professionals at the time of Covid-19. Following the arrests the online exhibition closed. On 8 April, a court fined Hatsura-Yavorskaya 700 Belarusian rubles for “protesting against police”. Another criminal case is now being prepared, accusing her of “raising money for protests”. In 2019, Hatsura-Yavorskaya visited the Belfast film festival at the invitation of Irish writer Laurence McKeown. The result was an exchange of films between Belarus, Britain and Ireland. As chair of the Belfast film festival and its sister organisation Docs Ireland, I went to Hatsura-Yavorskaya’s Watch Docs festival, and wrote about it for the Guardian. I was deeply impressed by how Tatsiana, a humanitarian activist and mother of four, steered her festival through the storm of KGB intervention, censorship and outright banning of films. Audiences were large and hungry for stories and perspectives outwith those of the state media. We at the Belfast film festival and Docs Ireland call on the authorities in Belarus to release Hatsura-Yavorskaya. And we ask other documentary film festivals, film workers and humanitarians to do the same. Tag @BelfastFilmFes1 on Twitter and we will retweet to the relevant authorities. Nonfiction cinema is our lingua franca. Those who speak it to governments should be defended.",Belarus culture workers,OTHERS
257,When Jeff Tried to Save the World review – slacker movie is an underachiever,"Straight out of film school, aged 22, while her peers were off interning, Kendall Goldberg directed her feature debut, this offbeat, earnest movie about a quarter-life crisis (released in the US in 2018). That’s an undeniably impressive achievement, and the film has some interesting ideas about overparenting and how grown-up kids can buckle under the pressure of Mum and Dad’s expectations. But otherwise it feels a bit generic – shuffling the pack of quirky indie movie cliches, not quite funny enough to be a comedy but with too little authentic emotion to work as drama. Jon Heder plays Jeff, the manager of Winky’s World, a bowling alley so poorly maintained that it’s acquired a kind of retro-chic. Jeff is an underachiever, a computer science graduate who takes medication for depression and anxiety. (Heder’s performance is a bit flat – like he sees depression as a giant vacuum cleaner that has sucked away Jeff’s personality.) The job at Winky’s suits Jeff; he likes the routine, it makes him feel safe. But the owner is threatening to sell, so Jeff decides to turn the business into a going concern, with free pizza and live music. This stuff is only ever mildly entertaining, though there’s a funny scene where he persuades the maintenance guy (Steve Berg doing a Zach Galifianakis) to trash-talk Winky’s to potential buyers. The more interesting scenes involve Jeff’s relationship with his prickly sister, trainee doctor Lindy (Anna Konkle) who shows up to crash on his floor with a friend. It turns out that everyone in his family believes that Jeff is a high-flying computer programmer. The suggestion, not fully explored, is that his self-esteem has been crushed by his demanding parents, who seem to have labelled him “the clever one” when the kids were small. His sister confesses to competing with him for their attention: “I had to get into med school to prove that I existed.” It’s a genuinely moving scene in a film where the actors often look like they’re mimicking real feelings. • When Jeff Tried to Save the World is available on Sky on 13 April.",When Jeff Tried to Save the World,FILM
258,Oscars in talks to use BFI Southbank for Academy Awards show,"The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (Ampas) is in talks with the British Film Institute (BFI) to use the latter’s cinema complex, BFI Southbank, as part of the forthcoming Oscars ceremony, according to a report in Variety. Citing “multiple sources”, Variety says that Ampas is looking to use BFI Southbank, in London’s Waterloo, as one of the international “hubs” for its awards show, which is due to take place on Sunday 25 April in Los Angeles. Ampas was forced to change tack from its original plans for a “no Zoom” show after complaints that non-US based nominees would not be able to attend due to Covid regulations, and instead decided to set up a series of overseas event locations to allow participation for those unable to travel. France will have a “hub” at a studio in Paris. If the London event goes ahead, it is likely to take place in the early hours of Monday 26 April, due to the time difference, and controls will be in place to ensure Covid compliance. These will include negative Covid tests, quarantine for non-UK participants, and a restriction on guest numbers. UK-based nominees include actors Carey Mulligan, Daniel Kaluuya and Anthony Hopkins, and director Emerald Fennell. However, government regulations state that “attendees converging on and congregating in a site for a specific discrete performance or activity” are still banned, so any large scale indoor event may require special permission.",Oscars ceremony,OTHERS
259,Portal review – close encounters of the disappointing kind,"Here’s a close encounter of the disappointing kind, an anthology movie featuring a trio of sci-fi shorts from the crew behind the V/H/S horror films. Released in the US as Doors but renamed Portal for the UK, the three films together tell an alien-contact story set on Earth after a million portals open up – giant doors that look like they’re covered with shimmery iron-filings from school science experiments. Whatever planet they hail from, the portals do not appear to come in peace; half the world’s population vanish into them. The best of the shorts is number three, titled Lamaj, which stars TV on the Radio’s Kyp Malone as Jamal, a gentle and thoughtful scientist with a lustrous beard who lives alone in a cabin in the woods. Like Amy Adams’s linguist character in Arrival, Jamal communicates with the portals, and invites another scientist – his ex – over to share the moment. They stand there, eyes shining, faces radiant with the pure pleasure of scientific discovery. Then the cops turn up. The second segment, Knockers by Saman Kesh, is the flimsiest. It’s set weeks after the portals’ appearance, when teams of young gung-ho volunteers are being sent into the portals for research. They have 12 minutes inside to gather data; stay any longer and they risk getting “doors psychosis”. It’s a nonsensical film shot with Michel Gondry-style visual trickery, following two volunteers, a young couple (played by Lina Esco and Josh Peck), having a bad trip in a portal. The opener depicts the arrival, that apocalyptic moment when everyone realises Something is Wrong. It’s filmed from the point of view of a bunch of kids in detention – seriously freaked out when birds start slamming against the window, military helicopters buzzing overhead. The three pieces of the science-fiction puzzle fit together to make a bland, incurious picture with little awe at the universe. • Portal is released on 19 April on digital platforms",Portal,FILM
260,The Reckoning review – witch movie descends into misogynistic torture ordeal,"Here’s a deeply unpleasant and misogynistic horror about a woman accused of witchcraft, made in the image of Game of Thrones by British film-maker Neil Marshall (who has directed episodes of GoT). It starts off inoffensively, if shonkily. The year is 1665; the setting might be Essex or perhaps Yorkshire – the characters are a mix of blunt northerners and Essex chappies. Charlotte Kirk (co-writer of the script with Marshall) stars as farmer’s wife Grace Haverstock, whose husband hangs himself after being infected with bubonic plague. “I’m sorry for your loss,” says the landlord of the local boozer; the dialogue is a laughable mashup of modern and ye olden medieval. Grace is raw with grief – though it’s hard to tell from Kirk’s one-expression-fits-all wooden performance. (The costume and makeup departments don’t help, styling her like she’s modelling the cover of a Mills &amp; Boon cover, bodice ripe for the ripping, hair teased to a salon flick.) The village squire (Steven Waddington) accuses Grace of witchcraft after she rejects his advances, and calls in infamous witchfinder John Moorcroft (Sean Pertwee), a predictably pious hypocrite who arrives with a sinister cloaked female servant, Ursula (Suzanne Magowan), at his side. Up until this point, The Reckoning is merely ropey. Then Grace is strapped into a torture device and has a muzzle-like metal mask put over her face (presumably so that the audience can gawp at her being tortured without having to deal with seeing her agony). The witchfinder orders Ursula to turn Grace into a pincushion with tiny daggers. On day four, still not confessing, she is raped with an instrument that looks like a smear-test speculum but splays open to inflict grievous internal injuries. Late on in the third act, Grace gets her revenge – though how she can rampage around slaying after being tortured for days is never explained. The film left me shaking with anger more than fear. • The Reckoning is released on 16 April on digital platforms.",The Reckoning,FILM
261,Steelers review – doc tackles queer rugby’s small moments and big struggles,"There’s overwhelming precedent in film for the separation of LGBTQ stories and those told within the world of sport – two often diametrically opposed parts of life with very little crossover. What crossover there is has often been reductive or bleak, either poking fun or revealing a dark underbelly of intolerance and players forced to remain in the closet. It makes the prospect of optimistic documentary Steelers: The World’s First Gay and Inclusive Rugby Club much more welcome – and a way to modernise a musty narrative. Steelers is a modest film, both in production values and scope, in ways that sometimes work and sometimes don’t: the affecting small moments are often in need of a bigger picture to make them soar. It’s made by one of the London-based club’s former players, Australian reporter Eammon Ashton-Atkinson, who is narrator, director, writer and editor, telling the story of three queer people involved with the team as they compete against other gay clubs in the Bingham Cup. He teases out some moving testimonies and provides a stinging reminder for many straight viewers that coming out isn’t always the happy ending many think it is, and there are still wounds that need to heal over. But the structure is disjointed, flipping around without confidence, from scrappily shot one-on-ones with players to mostly B-roll footage taken at the Bingham Cup. The gameplay scenes aren’t quite immersive enough and the film is missing historical context: how this team – and gay rugby – went from a punchline to an industry. The limited focus leaves Steelers seeming more like promotional material for the club than standalone documentary. It’s clearly made on a shoestring budget and, while well-intentioned, it’s a little too half-baked to land. Best met with a polite clap rather than a hearty cheer. • Steelers is released on 16 April on Amazon Prime Video.",Steelers,FILM
262,Into the Labyrinth review – Dustin Hoffman psycho-thriller goes down a rabbit hole,"A face-off between Hollywood legend Dustin Hoffman and Toni Servillo, that veteran of contemporary Italian classics by Paolo Sorrentino? Sounds good. But sadly, the two never appear together in the same scene, and the film they appear in is frustratingly underpowered and derivative. Into the Labyrinth is a psychological horror-thriller directed by Donato Carrisi and adapted by him from his own bestselling novel L’uomo del labirinto. The setting is Italy, and a distraught young woman (Valentina Bellè) comes round from sedation in a private hospital room where a calm and mysterious doctor called Green (Hoffman) explains that she had been found, dumped unconscious by the side of the road, apparently by the sinister individual who kidnapped her as a teenager 15 years earlier – a sensational unsolved “cold case”. As a forensic profiler working with the police, he will now ask questions to reconstruct her terrifying existence in the prison which her abductor called the “labyrinth”. At which point the audience is entitled to ask: erm, why are they speaking in English, when all the rest of dialogue is in Italian? Did she learn English in captivity? Meanwhile, a bleary private detective called Bruno Genko (played by Servillo), specialising in banal cases of debt recovery, hears about this young woman’s safe return and finds that it is now his own mysterious destiny to track down her kidnapper who apparently likes to wear a huge rabbit mask – as in the film Donnie Darko. There is some incidental interest in the bizarre comic-book settings and locations and indeed the weird comic book called “Bunny” which appears to have inspired the crazed villain himself. But the narrative focus is damagingly and pointlessly split between Servillo and Hoffman, two actors whose considerable screen presences tend to subtract from each other. And the cheat-twist ending is basically all too familiar. • Into the Labyrinth is released on 19 April on digital platforms.",Into the Labyrinth,FILM
263,Happy Happy Joy Joy: The Ren and Stimpy Story review – disturbing scenes,"Here is a documentary whose title contains radioactive levels of irony: happiness and joy are very far from what is to be found within. It is a behind-the-scenes profile of the pioneering TV animation Ren and Stimpy, which for those not around in the early 90s, featured an angry chihuahua (Ren) and a dopey, good-natured cat (Stimpy); with its hyper-stylised visuals, bad-taste humour and eye-watering violence, it found a cult status as a mould-breaking kidult show – very much at the adult end of the scale. The film is built around a profile of John Kricfalusi, Ren and Stimpy’s creator and mastermind; presumably it started out as a warts-and-all account of Kricfalusi’s eccentric (to say the least) management style, which culminated in his firing by Nickelodeon in 1992, shortly after the show’s second season began. However, whatever intentions directors Ron Cicero and Kimo Easterwood may have had were upended by the emergence of even more serious accusations: claims of grooming and underage sex, for which he subsequently apologised. Faced with scrapping everything and starting again, Cicero and Easterwood have folded the material into the litany of alleged abusive behaviour in his studio: initially tolerated as mad-genius enthusiasm but evolving into nasty control-freakery. Kricfalusi is interviewed at length (he apparently agreed only after his victims went to the media), as is Robin Byrd, one of his principal accusers. The result makes for an unbalanced final film; even if Kricfalusi emerges as a thoroughly unpleasant, if damaged, character, giving him the room to apologise (again) for sexual abuse has the effect of suggesting that somehow that’s the end of it, and even that it was the result of aberrations triggered by workplace stress. Happy Happy Joy Joy is a dismal coda to a fondly remembered show, with Kricfalusi’s collaborators still distressed over what happened. As one of his co-workers put it: “No one else worked harder to fuck it up than this guy.” • Happy Happy Joy Joy: The Ren and Stimpy Story is available on 16 April on True Story.",Happy Happy Joy Joy: The Ren and Stimpy Story,FILM
264,Ride or Die review – bloody revenge and blossoming love in shocking Japanese thriller,"The prolific director Ryūichi Hiroki has carved out a niche in modern Japanese cinema with his willingness to delve into the darker sides of sexuality. Following a start in the softcore “pink” films, He has moved to the mainstream while exploring subjects such as sadomasochism. Ride or Die, a live-action adaptation of Ching Nakamura’s arresting but disquieting manga series Gunjō, fits perfectly in the director’s transgressive wheelhouse. The moods of Ride or Die alternate between neon-lit cityscapes and sun-drenched open roads. The opening is shockingly baptised in blood: Rei (Kiko Mizuhara), a twentysomething lesbian, has slashed a man to death in his own home. It is later revealed that her victim is the abusive husband of Nanae (Honami Sato), a high-school classmate for whom Rei has held a torch for a decade. In perhaps the most destructive possible declaration of love, Rei has killed for Nanae, and together they embark on a getaway that doubles as a journey to their past. The bloodshed carries a poetic power: the life of a (bad) man is taken, only for the two women to see themselves reborn. Ride or Die is well-made and engrossing, despite its occasionally meandering pace. Texas-born Mizuhara, currently Japan’s most celebrated It girl, is hugely charismatic on screen. It is a pity that the film has damped down the pitch-black humour and sense of apathy found in its source material; the two women are designed to be much more obviously likable, their rough edges softened and the toxicity in their relationship diluted. The conspicuous use of easy listening tunes on the soundtrack doesn’t help, either. In the end though, Ride or Die boasts strong performances, and its beautiful cinematography takes viewers from metropolitan restlessness to the liberating seaside. • Ride or Die is available on Netflix.",Ride or Die,FILM
265,Ip Man: Kung Fu Master review – stylish martial arts potboiler,"For those not up to date with the martial arts film canon, Ip Man was a real historical figure: a master of Wing Chun, a type of southern Chinese kung fu, who until relatively recently was best known for having trained the great Bruce Lee. The real Ip died just before Lee in 1972, but his colourful life has since served as a basis for a series of films that have taken varying amounts of liberty with the facts, starting with the Donnie Yen vehicle Ip Man from 2008. In these films, Ip is more than just a historical figure: he’s a legendary character, a fighter for justice against rogue criminals and sinister foreigners, especially in the films that focus on his years as a policeman in Foshan after the second world war, before the communists came to power and Ip and his family left for Hong Kong. Conversely, in Wong Kar-Wai’s The Grandmaster, Ip serves as a vehicle for a languorous contemplation of martial arts philosophy. Scads more have followed of varying quality, and this latest one features Dennis To, playing the character for the third time, in the Foshan policeman stage of the story. To be honest, To is a less engaging performer than Yen, but his moves are nifty and director Li Liming films the fight scenes – which really make up most of the movie – with plenty of style. Li is very keen on crosscutting between quiet and noisy interactions during the fights; in the opening battle, for instance, between Ip and dozens of axe-wielding gangsters, his superior officer (Michael Wong) plays chess upstairs against a foe with the moves in both forms of combat paralleling each other. There’s some ace drunken-style fighting later, and inventive use of props, but the film takes itself a bit too seriously and reshuffles the deck of plot tropes instead of inventing its own ideas. Ultimately, it feels about as meaningful as a pop video, but if you enjoy martial arts films the way others like, say, dance films, it’s pleasant viewing.

266,Valley of Souls review –  quietly devastating Colombian drama,"“I thank those who have agreed to revisit these dark times,” reads the title card that closes this drama about a fisherman’s harrowing journey to retrieve the bodies of his two sons. Set in 2002, in the middle of the United Self-Defence Forces of Colombia’s (AUC’s) reign of terror, the film sees José (José Arley de Jesús Carvallido Lobo) drift downriver in his solitary canoe, scouring the debris that has washed up on the beach in search of clues. He knows it is forbidden to remove bodies from their unmarked grave – the otherwise gorgeous Magdalena river. José’s personal quest mirrors the political project of the Belgian-Colombian writer and director Nicolás Rincón Gille; both seek to preserve those who have disappeared under the AUC’s regime. It’s a devastating film, but doesn’t revel in the story’s inherent grimness. In one terrifying, tragicomic scene, José is brought face to face with a paramilitary chief who is obsessed with the Tour de France. Happily, his knowledge of this shared cultural reference ends up saving his life. Gille, who has a background in documentary film-making, pays particular attention to the natural beauty of the Bolívar region, choosing to foreground José’s stoicism instead of the way his life has been ravaged by violence. Lobo, too, is radiant, a pillar of strength holding steady amid a storm of grief. On Mubi",Valley of Souls,FILM
267,Cranston Academy: Monster Zone review – colourful if derivative Hogwartsian animation,"The two nominal main characters of this derivative but reasonably amusing computer-animated feature are a pair of teenage kids attending an elite Hogwartsian science school called Cranston Academy in London; the location signified by the fact it rains all the time and the teachers drink tea. Awkward American Danny (voiced, puzzlingly, by British actor Jamie Bell), who prefers to work solo, is forcibly teamed up with prissy but whipsmart Liz from Australia (Ruby Rose). Together, they get the school’s nuclear reactor working, but it opens up a portal to another dimension. This Promethean class project unleashes all manner of monsters, many of whom recall the creatures in Pixar’s Monsters, Inc. but with less affable personalities. The production, directed by Leopoldo Aguilar, emanates from Mexican cartoon studio Anima Estudios, which is interesting because only a tiny amount of animation comes out of the third country in North America, compared with the US and Canada. That also explains why, out of an already culturally eclectic cast of characters, a Mexican scientist is assigned the key role of semi-magical helper character. Known only as Mothman (voiced by Idzi Dutkiewicz) – he’s half-human, half-moth – he speaks the human language with a heavy Spanish accent and also sports wings and has a overwhelming urge to whisper sweet nothings to every lamp and torch he meets, like a lumophilic insectoid Pepé Le Pew. His heritage also allows for one of the funnier gags wherein Mothman, Danny and Liz go to a British “Mexican” restaurant and Mothman is utterly horrified by the atrocities described as “tacos” on the menu. The palette of hot, supersaturated colours is toned down by the use of more subdued tones for the night scenes, and while the character animation is not especially winning, neither is it annoying like too many other cartoon features these days. • Cranston Academy: Monster Zone is available on 19 April on Sky Cinema.",Cranston Academy: Monster Zone,FILM
268,Clapboard Jungle review – confessions of an indie horror film director,"Justin McConnell is a Canadian indie director who has here created what amounts to a tiring and self-indulgent video diary of the last five years as he tries to get his passion project made (a fantasy horror called Lifechanger). It is interspersed with what feels like hundreds of thousands of interviews with beaming film people, some very famous (such as Paul Schrader and Guillermo Del Toro), some not so famous, but all giving us their well-meant platitudes about getting your films made by following your dream and realising that it’s all about storytelling. Clapboard Jungle suffers from a weird mix of information overload and a lack of actual, usable information that might be of assistance to film-makers or of interest to film audiences. To an extraordinary degree, this film is packed with endless selfie shots of McConnell’s face as – zonked with stress or anxiety or disappointment – he trudges through airport department lounges on his way to festivals, placidly listens to music on a bus, or takes calls from producers and distributors passing on his project. This isn’t to say that there aren’t some nuggets of information here about the nightmare of independent film production: the money people won’t commit the cash until the talent are definitely on board and the talent won’t sign up until the money is definitely there. So something has to give and someone has to be lied to. At one stage, an actor who’s worked with McConnell gently reproves him about exaggerating the extent and solidity of the funding while the film was in development. But that is the business. As ever, people complain about the deluge of “content” which is sloshing over us all nowadays. Advances in digital technology have made it easier and cheaper to make films, but it hasn’t increased film-making talent or increased the number of people willing to watch the finished product. There is some good sense from Troma’s Lloyd Kaufman: “Nobody complained when there were thousands of paintings and drawings and comic book illustrations – why should anyone complain about too many movies?” • Clapboard Jungle is available on 19 April.",Clapboard Jungle,FILM
269,True Mothers review – tender Japanese adoption drama,"The Japanese film-maker Naomi Kawase adapts Mizuki Tsujimura’s 2015 novel in this tender, compassionate drama about the complexities of motherhood. Satoko (Hiromi Nagasaku), the adoptive mother of six-year-old Asato (Reo Sato), is thrown into crisis when a young woman claiming to be her son’s biological mother attempts to blackmail her. The film mostly plays out in flashback, giving context to each mother’s “truth”, and equal weight to both women’s sacrifices. “Baby Baton”, the charity that connects the two, requires Satoko to quit her job and pledge to become a full-time parent, while 14-year-old Hikari (Aju Makita) is told to legally agree to permanently sever all ties with her newborn son. Kawase’s frequent use of handheld camera gives parts of the film a quasi-documentary feel, but it’s the lyrical touches, such as a beam of blinding sunlight that falls on Satoko and her husband after signing the adoption papers, and an oceanic soundscape that recurs throughout, that hit the hardest.

270,Groundswell review – the fight against fracking in Ireland,"In 2010, the American film-maker Josh Fox released something that in retrospect looks like one of the most influential and original documentaries of recent times: GasLand. It was about something new to many at the time: fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, under the earth to release natural gas from shale rock, at the risk of polluting the water table and turning areas of natural beauty into sludge dumps – and that is aside from the existing larger implications of gas consumption. The film alerted many to a new environmental menace, and it plays its historic role in this new film from Johnny Gogan about the anti-fracking campaign in Ireland, often by people who were energised by seeing GasLand and determined to resist what one campaigner calls the new way of “scraping the bottom of the fossil-fuel barrel”. Exactly so. The coronavirus pandemic has, understandably, diverted many people’s attention from the climate crisis. But there is no vaccination for climate change. Groundswell shows how the fracking industry has been developing its interests in Ireland for many years, especially in North Leitrim, the corporations clearly calculating that it is unlikely to muster much protest because it is so sparsely populated. But communities did come together, with artists and writers joining the movement, and the Irish campaigners have been able to make international common cause with their equivalents in the United States, and draw on their knowledge. Ireland made history by banning not just fracking but also by importing fracked gas, and the fracking corporations are now pursuing their business over the border in Northern Ireland. A lesson to communities and campaigners there and everywhere else to stay vigilant. • Groundswell is released on 16 April on digital platforms.",Groundswell,FILM

More than 700 possessions of David Prowse, the Bristolian who played Darth Vader in the original Star Wars trilogy, are being sold off in his home city following his death aged 85 last year. Included is his The Empire Strikes Back script, which has key lines removed to keep Vader’s relationship with Luke Skywalker secret, a piece of the Millennium Falcon’s cockpit and a Vader mask Prowse is believed to have used for appearances at conventions and events. Appropriately, the collection will be sold on 4 May – a nod to the franchise’s famous line: “May the force be with you.” Auctioneer Andrew Stowe, of East Bristol Auctions, said: ‘‘When I was rummaging through the boxes from his house, every now and then I’d come across something special and it would send my brain racing. “In one box I’d find his Empire Strikes Back script, in another I found an actual piece of the Millennium Falcon, then a little deeper down I’d find a letter from Peter Cushing.” The Empire Strikes Back script is expected to sell for thousands. ‘‘My spine tingled when I first saw the script,” said Stowe. But the line revealing Vader and Luke’s relationship does not feature. Stowe said: “The reveal – perhaps the most recognised moment in cinema history – was kept a big secret from most of the cast. As Prowse’s lines would be over-dubbed by James Earl Jones he [Prowse] wasn’t privy to the secret, so instead, he was given alternate dialogue which is considerably less dramatic. But that in itself makes this a unique piece of history.’’ A percentage of proceeds from the auction will go to Alzheimer’s Research UK.",David Prowse’s items,OTHERS

The musical, written by Sparks duo Ron and Russell Mael, is described by the festival as “the story of Henry, a standup comedian with a fierce sense of humour, and Ann, a singer of international renown … They are the perfect couple, healthy, happy, and glamorous. The birth of their first child, Annette, a mysterious girl with an exceptional destiny, will change their lives.” It is Carax’s first English-language film and is set in Los Angeles. The film will screen in Cannes on 6 July, after the festival’s opening ceremony, and will simultaneously go on general release in France. Holy Motors, Carax’s last film, screened in competition in 2012. In January, the festival announced that its public event would be moved from its traditional mid-May date to July, after its initial plans were derailed by Covid regulations. The organisers intend to hold in-person screenings; however, cinemas in France are closed as part of a national lockdown that began on 3 April. The Cannes film market, normally held at the same time as the festival, will go ahead as a virtual event in May. The 2020 edition of the festival shelved its “physical” screening programme, replacing it instead with a selection of more than 50 films, including period fossil-hunter romance Ammonite, afterlife animation Soul and ski-competition sex-abuse drama Slalom. The festival said the rest of the selection will be announced in May.

274,Sofia review – Moroccan society through the eyes of an unwed mother,"In Morocco, sex outside marriage is punishable by up to 12 months in prison. But when unmarried Sofia gives birth, in this debut feature from Meryem Benm’Barek, her family’s biggest fear is not her going to jail, it’s preserving their honour. The film is straightforward, a blunt social-realist drama. (Sofia goes into labour at a kitchen sink, while washing up.) Only at the end does it dawn on you how carefully the story is plotted: something happens that recasts everything that has gone before – and, if anything, makes the story even more grim. Maha Alemi stars as 20-year-old Sofia, who doesn’t know that she is pregnant until her waters break during a family party in Casablanca. It’s never clear whether Sofia, who didn’t gain much weight, was completely unaware of the pregnancy; perhaps she suspected it but had blocked it out. Her face is mostly blank, and she walks through the film numbed and zombie-like. After the birth, her family is disgusted – and terrified that a scandal will blow her dad’s business deal with wealthy entrepreneur named Ahmed. (Ahmed is played by Mohamed Bousbaa. Like a bit character in a murder mystery, watch him – he’ll be important later.) Everyone agrees the only solution is to find the man who got Sofia pregnant and persuade him to recognise the baby. Sofia and her rich cousin Lena (Sarah Perles) drive around to find the guy, Omar (Hamza Khafif), who turns out to be no one’s idea of a perfect son-in-law. Benm’Barek refuses to flatten her script into a simplistic tale of misogyny. This is about class, too. If you have the money and the connections, you can bypass the law. Things happen to Sofia that would never happen to middle-class, educated Lena. What a clear-eyed and pitiless film this is; it left me hankering for the chinks of tender optimism in a Ken Loach movie. • Sofia is available on 23 April on Your Screen.",Sofia,FILM
275,Fear of Rain review – lurid horror film takes aim at mental illness stereotypes,"Here’s a horror flick that wants to have its cake and eat it: combining a well-intentioned drama about teenage mental illness with a lurid potboiler. Director Castille Landon seems to be wagging her finger at films containing damaging stereotypes of mental health, while telling her own sensational and lurid story. In Florida, a high-schooler with schizophrenia becomes convinced that the woman next door is keeping a little girl locked up in her attic. Is she hallucinating, or is her neighbour a kidnapper? It opens with a nastily effective slasher movie scene: a hooded man stalks a blond teenager through a cemetery, then buries her alive in a shallow grave. The girl wakes up thrashing in a hospital bed. This is Rain (Madison Iseman), who’s had a terrifying psychotic episode after stopping her meds. Her concerned parents are played by Katherine Heigl and Harry Connick Jr; they seem to have walked in from a syrupy Nicholas Sparks adaptation, bemused and blank-faced. Back in her bedroom, Rain picks a piece of her own fingernail out of the wall, in case anyone is in any doubt how serious her illness is. At school she is a pariah. “Careful or she’ll go all Carrie on you,” jokes her ex-best friend. But gorgeous new kid Caleb (Israel Broussard) seems to dig Rain’s gorgeous-but-vulnerable vibe. “I love your brain,” he tells her. He is also willing to go along with her highly dubious theory that their single-lady English teacher, Dani (Eugenie Bondurant) – who happens to be Rain’s neighbour – has taken a child prisoner. Bondurant’s creepy performance is the highlight of the film. Landon films the angles of her androgynous face to perfection: in a certain kind of light she looks frail and caring; from another angle she’s menacing as hell. Fear of Rain won’t be winning any awards for mental health awareness with its silly hash of psychology, packaging up illness to fit the schlock’n’shock of the story. But there are a couple of ludicrous twists at the end that make it very watchable. • Fear of Rain is released on 26 April on digital platforms.",Fear of Rain,FILM
276,The Oak Room review – bar-room tales brew up a storm,"Several men walk into several bars in this interlocking suite of tales, and the repeating permutations of barman and barfly, blue collar and white collar, father and son, raconteur and listener pile up pleasingly into a kind of oppressive, Coenesque cosmic joke. RJ Mitte, Breaking Bad’s Walter White Jr, plays college boy Steve, who turns up in a snowstorm at a bar owned by the irascible Paul (Peter Outerbridge). He owes the latter money – and without it, Paul won’t give up the ashes of Steve’s recently deceased dad, Gord, whose funeral the youth failed to attend. And then this arrogant sadsack – whose very presence aggravates Paul – offers to pay him with a story. Steve’s yarn is a slack spin on his own: a freezing wayfarer walks into The Oak Room, a pub in a neighbouring town, and puts a set of demands to an irked barman. Unimpressed, Paul tells him that he must learn to “goose the truth” to hold an audience, and then sucker-punches him with a story about Gord, with another story inside. Or he thinks it’s a sucker-punch – Steve reveals that he had only told the ending of his, and the start will transform everything. Adapted from Peter Genoway’s stage play by the playwright himself, the film is almost completely dialogue-reliant and initially a bit wearing. But as the tales gather weight like snow on a roof, and intriguing correspondences accumulate, the impressive structuring tells. What at first appear to be rather impoverished visuals from Canadian director Cody Calahan – a window of storm-blown exterior the only respite from bar-room wood – starts feeling like an uncomfortably tight grip. It’s not immediately clear what deeper point this suffocating proliferation is making, but perhaps it is about control: whose narrative gets to predominate, who in this countertop-sparring full of filial issues is the “daddy”. Or perhaps ultimately no one is, and in this infinite story regression, we are all equally – as Gord concludes – in hell. TV veteran Outerbridge strategically overplays, allowing the seemingly callow and flaky Mitte to come to the fore. This sharply crafted piece talks the talk and finally threatens to walk the walk. • The Oak Room is available on 26 April on digital platforms.",The Oak Room,FILM
277,Golden Globes crisis continues as former president sends anti-BLM email,"Already under fire for its failings over membership diversity, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), the organisation behind the Golden Globes, has been forced to apologise after its former long-term president emailed a copy of an article to members that called Black Lives Matter a “racist hate group”. According to the LA Times, Phil Berk, who served eight terms as the HPFA president, ending in 2011, shared a copy of an article from rightwing website Frontpagemag.com, which described Black Lives Matter as a “racist … hate group” and claimed that the movement is carrying out the “race war” that Charles Manson aspired to start. In its statement, the HFPA said: “The views expressed in the article circulated by Mr Berk are those of the author of the article and do not – in any way shape or form – reflect the views and values of the HFPA. The HFPA condemns all forms of racism, discrimination and hate speech and finds such language and content unacceptable.” The LA Times reported that a number of HFPA members responded angrily to Berk’s email, with one writing “The vile rhetoric contained in this screed is simply unacceptable”, and another calling Berk “a thundering disgrace”. The crisis engulfing the HFPA began shortly before the Golden Globes award ceremony in January, when an LA Times report accused the organisation of a lack of diversity in its membership as well as “ethical lapses” in the way it conducted its business. The HFPA’s subsequent pledge to add “Black and other underrepresented professionals to [the] organisation” and improve “transparency” over its voting and membership processes, was deemed inadequate by high-profile film industry campaign group Time’s Up. In March a large group of influential Hollywood PR agencies said they would boycott the Golden Globes, the primary source of the HFPA’s income, unless the HFPA made “profound and lasting change”.",Golden Globes crisis,OTHERS
278,Homeward review – Crimean Tatars on a heartbreaking odyssey,"In Homeward, personal and collective pains weave together to make a quietly searing work. Nariman Aliev’s directorial debut depicts the rootlessness of the Crimean Tatars, as well as his own personal history of displacement. Though having a cross-country odyssey at the centre of its narrative, the film acutely understands what many road trip movies have missed: for marginalised people, the open road rarely equates to freedom. In fact, the Tatars in Homeward are constantly subjected to aggressions from others as well as state surveillance. The journey begins at a place of death: the morgue. Mustafa (Akhtem Seitablaev) is here to pick up the body of his son Nazim (Anatoliy Marempolskiy) who has died in the Russo-Ukrainian war. His other son Alim (Remzi Bilyalov), a college student, sits silently on a nearby bench. It remains unclear at first that the two are related; their body language is awkward as an uneasy, tense distance lingers between them. After retrieving the body, Mustafa and Alim face numerous obstacles, both from themselves and from outsiders, as they attempt to return to Russian-annexed Crimea for the burial. Homeward makes clear that the displacement faced by the Crimean Tatars – created by centuries of forced transfer, culminating in Stalin’s huge-scale deportations in 1944 – is painfully intergenerational. The loss of a collective autonomy destroys personal relationships: Mustafa is not only estranged from his sons but also from his own brother. But there are unexpected moments of bonding. One of Homeward’s most touching scenes is when rugged and street-smart Mustafa teaches fresh-faced Alim how to use a knife. A peculiar playfulness emerges here, as if the duo are playing catch and not, in fact, practising stabbing assailants. Seitablaev delivers a particularly moving performance, navigating between brutal patriarchal machismo and devastating torment. Bilyalov, a non-professional actor, doesn’t quite achieve the same depth, but the striking visuals as well as the authenticity of the storytelling still make Homeward a compelling, heartbreaking watch. • Homeward is released on 23 April on digital platforms.",Homeward,FILM
279,The Race to Save the World review – paying the price for climate change protest,"An assortment of American climate-change activists, from teenagers to septuagenarians, are tracked over several months as they protest, get arrested and face charges in court. All the while, each of them must try to reconcile the demands of family life with their commitment to saving the planet. And each is so passionate about activism that personal relationships certainly do suffer. For example, Bill Moyer, a resident of Washington state, spends most of his time leading a campaign against fossil fuel use that involves demonstrations with kayaks – “kayaktivism” – and draping colourful banners from bridges. His teenage daughter says that she admires what her dad does but she also resents it when he’s not there for her birthday party. It becomes clear he’s missed a lot of father-daughter bonding, and making pancakes for breakfast every day for a year will only get so far in repairing the damage. Similarly, Abby Brockway, another protester parent who blocks the path of a train ferrying oil, says she would prefer to go to prison rather than get let off with community service because it would attract more attention. This is news to her husband when she announces it on camera, and he doesn’t seem pleased. There is no doubting the sincerity of these activists or the rightness of the cause they are fighting for, even though on a more granular level each is challenging a specific iniquity, such as fracking or pipelines. Is it a problem if some of them seem insufferably earnest, self righteous and annoying? It doesn’t help that director Joe Gantz seems determined to serve up these stories with lashings of soppy, emotive music and corny montages. But if the human interest angle prompts more sympathy for climate activists, surely that’s a good thing. • The Race to Save the World is released on 22 April on digital platforms.",The Race to Save the World,FILM
280,Forget Everything and Run review – scenic zombie adventure lacks bite,"It is increasingly difficult to carve out a niche in the overpopulated world of postapocalyptic survivalist movies. This low-budget effort – alternatively titled with its initials, FEAR – falls somewhere between The Walking Dead, A Quiet Place, The Revenant and It Comes at Night – but, like its central family, it struggles to find a place to call its own. The setting is a scenic, snowy, mountainous region, presumably in North America, and the opening crawl ramps up the Covid resonance: a world struck by a deadly virus, a sealed-off area where “every day we fight to survive. Hiding. Scavenging. Clinging to hope …” Thus, we are up to speed when a growling, raving, zombie-like madman comes charging through the woods at combat-ready Ethan (Jason Tobias, who co-directed and co-wrote) and his nervous son (Danny Ruiz). Back at home – though their rundown shack barely fits the description – are resourceful mum Joe (Marci Miller) and a teenage daughter who has succumbed to the zombie virus, and is strapped to a bed upstairs on life support. (The family are holding out for access to a cure.) This already precarious existence is threatened further when they are raided by marauders equipped with superior firearms and human shields. The result of their violent battle is a negotiated standoff that splits the action: Joe keeps her gun on the marauders’ scheming matriarch (a convincingly fiery Susan Moore Harmon), Ethan goes with her brother to fetch medicine and fuel from their camp. Nobody trusts anyone – nor should they. As action gives way to extended dialogue scenes and flashbacks to happier, pre-apocalypse times, the pace slackens. Characters conveniently disappear for extended stretches and questions mount about the wider scenario, which is confusingly explained but barely depicted, probably for budget reasons. The performers are mostly fine and the action is well staged, but for all its energy and commitment, the story finds nowhere to run. • Forget Everything and Run is available on 26 April on digital platforms.",Forget Everything and Run,FILM
281,Spring Blossom review – a fleeting affair with heart,"How much does our appreciation of a film depend on our knowledge of the film-maker? The question is difficult to avoid with this tale of a 16-year-old schoolgirl who develops a relationship with an older man. It was made by its star, Suzanne Lindon, who wrote it when she was 15 and directed it when she was 20. Lindon is also the daughter of French actors Vincent Lindon and Sandrine Kiberlain, which some might perceive as a bit of a head start, but she certainly holds her own here. Lindon plays “Suzanne”, a student from a loving, affluent Parisian family (in appearance she resembles a young Charlotte Gainsbourg). She doesn’t lack friends, but she is bored with her immature peer group. On her walk to school every day she starts to notice Raphaël (Arnaud Valois), a handsome, 35-year-old actor performing at the local theatre. He also seems bored. Suzanne becomes curious, and the two draw closer. As much as Suzanne is mature beyond her years, Raphael seems somewhat immature – even ordering the same sugary soft drink as her at cafes. Is it possible for these two to meet somewhere in the middle? From the outside, their relationship skirts the boundaries between schoolgirl crush and sexual exploitation, but these complications are not really the story’s concern. Predominantly seen from Suzanne’s point of view, it is something more intimate, hesitant and innocent – and less cliched. For one thing, there is no overtly sexual dimension to their liaison. (As if to prove she knows the territory, Lindon includes a nod to Maurice Pialat’s 1983 movie A Nos Amours, which centred on a promiscuous 16-year-old, also named Suzanne.) Nor does the outside world particularly encroach. Lindon lets her story unfold in simple, natural strokes, aside from a few key moments where the couple’s movements morph into coordinated, choreographed dance moves. Where some might praise an Eric Rohmer-style lightness of touch, others might see a certain slightness. And at barely 70 minutes, this is a fleeting affair in every sense. Perhaps that’s the point. • Spring Blossom is released on 23 April on Curzon Home Cinema.",Spring Blossom,FILM
282,The Last Photograph review – Danny Huston’s faded snapshot of a father’s grief,"The fiendish eyebrows that make Danny Huston so castable as a Hollywood character actor play second fiddle to his jawline – a slight droop around the jowls that lends a heaviness to his deeply felt performance as a man broken by grief. This London-set drama is Huston’s first time behind the camera in more than 20 years. Before he was an actor he was a director – just like his dad John – and he has a knack with actors, although the film is flat in places and more than a little bland. Huston is Tom Hammond, a bookshop owner and an irritable one – the sort of man who snaps rudely at a homeless person begging in a doorway. He’s first seen at home in Chelsea stashing a wad of £50 notes into his battered leather briefcase. When he’s robbed, though, the money turns out to be a red herring. Tucked inside a battered paperback in the bag was the precious last photograph of his son Luke (Jonah Hauer-King), a university student. The photo was taken the night before Luke was killed on board the Pan Am flight to New York that exploded over Lockerbie in 1988. In flashbacks of father and son together, it is wrenching to watch the difference between Tom now and then – a playful, emotionally attuned dad who is clearly dappy about his bright, beautiful boy. The script, adapted by Simon Astaire from his novel, gives flimsier flashbacks to Luke and his American girlfriend, Kate (Stacy Martin), falling in love. These are shot by Huston in a cringeworthy, dreamy style. In the present, Tom looks for his briefcase and makes a kind-of friendship with gorgeous restaurant owner Hannah, played by the astonishing and magnetic Sarita Choudhury, who was Saul’s wife in Homeland and deserves a chunky lead of her own. The film has its emotional moments but sometimes seems as lifeless as a faded old photo. • The Last Photograph is released on 26 April on digital platforms.",The Last Photograph,FILM
283,Golden Globes crisis deepens as former president expelled and advisers resign,"The crisis-plagued Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), the body that organises the Golden Globes, has expelled Philip Berk, its former president who sparked widespread outrage by sharing an anti-Black Lives Matter article that described the movement as a “racist hate group”. In a brief statement, the HFPA said: “Effective immediately, Phil Berk is no longer a member of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.” The HFPA’s move follows outspoken criticism from NBC, the TV network that broadcasts and pays for the Golden Globes, which called for Berk’s expulsion. “NBC strongly condemns Phil Berk’s actions … [and] swift action on this front is an essential element for NBC to move forward with the HFPA and the Golden Globes.” Berk’s removal followed the controversy over his email, reported by the LA Times, in which he forwarded an article by a rightwing website. A number of HFPA members had responded angrily to Berk’s email, with one writing: “The vile rhetoric contained in this screed is simply unacceptable”, and another calling Berk “a thundering disgrace”. However, the HFPA was hit by further problems after it was reported that Dr Shaun Harper, its recently hired diversity and inclusion adviser, had resigned. Harper, the executive director of USC’s Race and Equity Center, had been hired as a consultant by the HFPA after criticism of the lack of diversity among the organisation’s membership. He reportedly resigned after a meeting with representatives of the Time’s Up campaign group, including director-producer Ava DuVernay and producer Shonda Rhimes. The Hollywood Reporter quoted Harper’s resignation letter, which said: “I no longer have confidence in our ability to collaboratively deliver the transformational change that the industry and the people in it whom I deeply respect are demanding of you.” Another of the HFPA’s recently hired consultants, crisis management firm Smith &amp; Company, which is run by celebrated “crisis guru” Judy Smith, has also reportedly departed from its advisory role.

284,Cielo review – love letter to the desert’s starry skies,"Cielo means “sky” in Spanish, and “heaven”, too. And it’s with a sense of humbled wonder at the immense mystery of it all that the Canadian film-maker Alison McAlpine casts her camera upwards in this beautiful documentary about the night sky. It’s filmed at the stargazing hotspot of Chile’s Atacama desert, where there is virtually no light pollution; the heavens appear to be within touching distance – as if a seam in the sky has been unpicked and the stars tumble out like diamonds. For those of us who live in urban areas, we look up from noisy streets and bright city lights to the vast emptiness of the sky. In Atacama, it’s the reverse; the sky seems more alive than the earth – a bare, Martian landscape of rock and sand. With her cinematographer, Benjamín Echazarreta, McAlpine shoots some astonishing time-lapse photography, which features alongside interviews with astronomers at the European observatories in the desert and locals who eke out a living somehow. One man is a UFO photographer; he thinks that humans are more evil than the aliens and, knowing this, the aliens don’t bother to land. This is a mellow, meandering film and, personally, I would have found a couple of explainers and captions to introduce the stargazers useful. The interviews with the astronomers are terrific; one of them explains that she’s not spiritual, and when she looks into the sky it’s the Earth she’s thinking about, how insignificant we humans are, how tiny in the universe, like ants. A local man movingly explains how his daughter, before she died, pointed to one of Orion’s stars and told him to remember her by it. On the other hand, the score of wind instruments and blippy electronic noises gives it a generic cine-essay feel, and McAlpine’s voiceover of poetic musings doesn’t help. At times this does feel like a bit of an unwitting test of the audience’s attention span. • Cielo is available on 23 April on True Story.",Cielo,FILM
285,The Seventh Day review – Guy Pearce’s hipster priest dices with the devil,"As a Guy Pearce stan, I would happily watch him read a vacuum cleaner instruction manual for two hours. So there was a delicious thrill in discovering he co-stars in this reasonably compelling horror feature as a nattily dressed hipster priest, sporting a plaid coat that looks designed by Gucci. The idea is that Pearce’s character, Father Peter, learned the hard way during the pre-credits sequence just how nasty a business exorcism can be when he was an apprentice in the 1990s (the character played by Chris Galust for the purposes of a flashback) and saw a young boy burnt by the hellish force of evil. Fast forward to the present day, and Peter is assigned to teach a promising young pup fresh out of exorcism school, Father Daniel (Vadhir Derbez, a bit dull but pretty looking) how to handle demons. Their main quarry will be young Charlie (Brady Jenness, impressive), an adolescent boy who messed around with a Ouija board and ended up murdering his entire family with an axe. Poor Charlie is now locked up in an especially filthy-looking jail while he awaits trial, and Peter prods Daniel through the necessary steps he must take to reach the underlying evil that has engineered the situation. To reveal more would spoil the satisfying twist, but suffice it to say writer-director Justin P Lange finds a satisfying way to update the possession-exorcist theme for a new generation grown wary of the Catholic church’s old ways, particularly in the wake of the abuse scandals that have shredded the clergy’s credibility in recent years. In fact, the script might have gone a little further and put a bit more thought into exploring the collision between our expectations from horror as a genre and the real-world horrors inflicted on children accused of being “evil”. But this will do, especially as it’s a chance to watch Pearce and his remarkable cheekbones and gleeful weirdness at work with a scripture-chewing performance that puts a lot of meat on what could have been an off-the-peg turn from a lesser actor. • The Seventh Day is released on 26 April on digital platforms.",The Seventh Day,FILM

287,Sisters With Transistors review – an electrifying study of musical heroines,"Lisa Rovner’s superb documentary pays a deeply deserved, seldom-expressed tribute to the female composers, musicians and inventors from the brief history of electronic music. The focus falls on about nine or 10 women in the field, from experimental music pioneer Clara Rockmore, a Theremin maestro in bias-cut evening dress, through to the British composer and mathematician Delia Derbyshire (probably best known for co-creating the Doctor Who theme), up to Suzanne Ciani, the first woman to score a major Hollywood movie (The Incredible Shrinking Woman in 1981) and her contemporary, composer and early software designer Laurie Spiegel. Each of them entered the field of electronic music from different paths. Unsurprisingly, several started out as classically trained musicians. Others did not: Daphne Oram, for instance, was originally a sound engineer at the BBC before went on to win scientific grants for her research and creating a method of writing on celluloid to score electronic sound. Although Rovner keeps the focus mostly on the women’s work and accomplishments, passing mention of some of the their biographical details points to a remarkable diversity. Pauline Oliveros, a founding member of the influential San Francisco Tape Music Centre, was an out lesbian and Wendy Carlos, who helped develop the Moog synthesiser and won fame for Switched-On Bach, was an early transgender pioneer. Indeed, the film touches on so many characters and ideas it could have been sliced up and rearranged in any number of ways without making gender the connective thematic thread. It could have accentuated the relationship between electronic music and other experimental art forms of the mid-20th century, or the overlap electronic music and technological innovation elsewhere. Rovner’s assiduous, often playful use of archive material points to connections between these musicians and 80s art-school punks such as Thurston Moore and Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth, 50s independent film-makers such as Shirley Clarke, 60s antiwar protestors and 70s Silicon Valley tech pioneers. Not that there’s anything to complain about regarding the woman-artist angle. In fact, a stray remark by contemporary composer Holly Herndon beautifully sums up the feedback loop of visible diversity and why it matters that female pioneers are honoured: “There is something psychological that happens when you can see yourself in the people who are being celebrated.” Surely it will only be a matter of time before someone uses this as inspiration for a biopic project or two, perhaps with Keira Knightley as the compelling Delia Derbyshire.

288,Counter Histories: Rock Hill review – landmark segregation protest gets muddled documentary,"This 53-minute documentary spotlights an important milestone during the 1960s American civil rights movement that has lost none of its significance. On 31 January 1961, a group of African American students staged a sit-in at a segregated lunch counter at McGrory’s, a store in Rock Hill, South Carolina. In an act of defiance, the young men, who attended the nearby Friendship Junior College, proceeded to order food. Refused service and asked to leave, the men remained until they were arrested for trespassing. What they did after their arrest was even more significant. Out of the 10 students who were arrested, nine refused to post bail and instead served their 30-day sentences. This was the relatively new “jail, no bail” method of resistance. Though enduring hard labour and solitary confinement in jail, the men hoped to lessen the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People’s financial burden of paying bail for protesters. Such a poignant moment in American history deserves to have its story told; and indeed, the interviews with some of the Friendship Nine possess a visceral vividness, immediately transporting viewers back to that fateful January day. However, these powerful anecdotes are sapped by the documentary’s empty and distracting tactics. For instance, for most of its runtime – even when the interviewees are speaking – there is jazz music running constantly in the background, drowning out the stories. Re-enactment scenes simply consist of actors robotically miming events in silence and in slow motion, like a fashion show. Such choices are attempting to evoke the aesthetics of the period, but next to the energy and vigour of the interviewees, these touches come across as thin and hollow, obscuring a dynamic historical episode. Besides the muddled style, there’s also little coherence to the film’s presentation of the events and their context; it does an unfortunate disservice to the story that it tries to honour. • Counter Histories: Rock Hill is released on 26 April on digital platforms.",Counter Histories: Rock Hill,FILM
289,The Ride review – life lessons on the road to BMX glory,"“Another life lesson?” snaps flailing foster kid John (Shane Graham), as his new family attempt to throw him another emotional lifeline. This inspirational drama-cum-antiracist statement, sponsored by the likes of Vans, Etnies and Powell-Peralta, does indeed come over a bit like the action-sports version of the Disney movie but is luckily given just enough emotional ballast by its performers. Graham stars as real-life BMX star John Buultjens – whose story has been transposed from Glasgow to Oakdale, California – who is taken into care at the start of the film aged nine for stabbing his abusive father (played by Buultjens himself). Already being drawn into the orbit of Nazi gangs, with a small swastika forcibly carved into his neck, this white supremacist poppet has to fight for his life in juvie, and grows into a tight-lipped, perpetually vigilant teenager. Then one day his social worker finds him a place in the foster home of mixed-race couple Marianna (Sasha Alexander) and Eldridge Buultjens (Ludacris, on secondment from Fast &amp; Furious ). John’s hostile glances and bigoted quips run right off Eldridge, who gives as good as he gets. “I wanna let you know I packed your lunch myself today – I even threw some crackers in there.” But teaching him to ride a bike is the first inroad towards getting John to expose his vulnerabilities; after he pulls a neat 360 off his school steps, it becomes obvious the kid has talent. Makeshift father and son become closer after John receives an answer to his question, “Why me?” – Eldridge has also come out of institutional care and values a survivor. This core of shared pain, shame and resilience gives vital heft to the tritely relayed antiracist message (as John inevitably runs into his former gang) and to the BMX competition climax, which follows the well-worn berms and jumps of the sports drama. Graham and Ludacris have good, combative chemistry: the youngster, who looks like Michael Shannon, with a face sharpened to an arrowhead; the latter soaking up confrontation with almost amused relish. If the next Fast &amp; Furious spin-off wants to go eco, it could do worse than getting these two to hit the pedals again. • The Ride is available on Sky Cinema from 24 April.",The Ride,FILM
290,House of Cardin review – genial fashion futurist with an eye for expansion,"After a somewhat breathless opening section – yes, we get it, Pierre Cardin was a genius – this genuflecting documentary settles down into a watchable portrait of the late fashion designer that astutely showcases Cardin’s ease in front of the camera (Cardin died in December 2020, after this film was first released). Although there are a string of archive clips featuring Cardin waspishly telling people off or putting them in their place back in the 1960s and 70s, Cardin, in his ninth decade, comes across as a genial, self-deprecating presence, happy to keep on putting projects into the pipeline even though he knows he won’t live to see them realised. We get a concise biographical history: from his Italian childhood to his early years as a tailor for Christian Dior, through to his increasingly otherworldly clothes designs and launchpad to global brand. What comes across most strongly is that, while Cardin may have been a genius when it comes to shape and line, he was certainly a genius when it came to diversification and product licensing, as well as being an early identifier of markets in the US, Russia and south-east Asia. (While showing a bunch of students around his fashion archive, Cardin proudly points to his pleated coat, exclaiming: “200,000 sold in the US!”) This film is very much the authorised version, so not unnaturally we get squads of acolytes and employees lining up to explain exactly how brilliant/groundbreaking/sensitive he is; we also get some moon-eyed celebrity endorsements (Alice Cooper, Sharon Stone), but fortunately also one or two people who really know what they are talking about, in the shape of Philippe Starck and Jean Paul Gaultier. Through it all, Cardin sails serenely: accepting the adoration of the crowd, casually admitting his lifetime’s ambition was actually to be an actor, publicly passing the torch to his great-nephew Rodrigo Basilicati. Compared to, say, Valentino: The Last Emperor (from 2008), this is pretty restrained stuff, but you definitely get a sense of Cardin’s ability to mix artistic steel and commercial savvy. A decent tribute. • House of Cardin is released on 26 April on digital platforms.",House of Cardin,FILM
291,Red Moon Tide review – sea spirits haunt the Spanish coast,"The strange and striking landscapes of coastal Galicia in northwest Spain are the backdrop to this beguiling landscape film, less a conventional narrative and more a haunting prose piece, tying together ancient superstitions with fears of a coming environmental apocalypse. The central story concerns the disappearance of a local fisherman, Rubio, who believed a sea monster was responsible for the community’s dwindling catch and set out to hunt it down. Rubio is something of a local hero who, we are told, has saved more than 40 people from drowning. In his absence, the town almost literally comes to a standstill. His story is recounted in voiceover by various townsfolk, whom we see standing stock still in the landscape, as if frozen in time. The entire film is told in this fashion. There are no conventional scenes or dialogue, only voiceover and occasional intertitles. Visually it is a series of static or slightly mobile tableaux, often evocative and meticulously composed – somewhere between Andrei Tarkovsky and photographer Andreas Gursky. There are wide, open landscapes, plains, woodlands, mysteriously shaped rocks, moonlit seas (the lunar cycle is implicated in the sea monster’s arrival). There are austere interiors so still the livestock now wander through them. Some of the imagery plays tricks with scale: what appears at first to be water running down a wall turns out to be a vast concrete dam. The soundtrack is full of moaning and wailing and keening of monsters of the deep, and occasionally the squelching footsteps of an invisible walker – presumably the spirit of Rubio. Providing some narrative impetus are three witches who arrive to help look for Rubio. They drape the static townsfolk in white sheets, like ghosts. The trance-like pacing and mystical meditation might frustrate viewers looking for an easy watch, but local film-maker Lois Patiño is clearly operating at the fine-art end of the cinema scale. He applies his distinctive mode to a story that’s both ravishing and unsettling. • Red Moon Tide is available on 20 April on Mubi.",Red Moon Tide,FILM
292,Laddie: The Man Behind the Movies review – Star Wars film boss gets his name up in lights,"Here is a highly watchable documentary about Hollywood executive Alan Ladd Jr: an old gold Hollywood profile leavened with top-notes of family strife and reconciliation. Ladd, famously, was the studio boss at 20th Century Fox who got Star Wars through when the corporate brass wanted to pull the plug; but as this film shows, there was quite a lot more to him than that. As his name indicates, Ladd was the son of troubled he-man actor Alan Ladd (This Gun for Hire, Shane) and it’s safe to say they didn’t have the best of relationships: as a gawky teenager, Ladd Jr didn’t fit in with his father’s attempts to project a wholesome family image and can be seen scowling in the background of publicity photos as his younger siblings were pushed front and centre. The film’s director, Ladd Jr’s daughter Amanda Ladd-Jones takes this theme pretty seriously, as well she might; she talks in voiceover about feeling abandoned as a kid by her work-obsessed father, and Ladd himself relates his voracious moviegoing appetite to his isolation. An impressive series of talking heads, including Ron Howard, Mel Brooks and Ridley Scott, line up to shower praise on Ladd – apparently a man of excellent taste, steadfast loyalty, and unfailing modesty. There’s no reason not to take this on trust; in any case his projects speak for themselves. As well as Star Wars he greenlit Alien, Young Frankenstein and The Omen for Fox; later, at MGM, he put through A Fish Called Wanda, Moonstruck and Thelma &amp; Louise. In between studio stints he acted as an independent producer, working on Chariots of Fire, Blade Runner and Braveheart. (He is possibly less proud of starting the Police Academy series.) Ladd-Jones is heartfelt in her desire to communicate her father’s special qualities, as well as outline the sacrifices made (on both sides). An illuminating, affecting piece of work. • Laddie: The Man Behind The Movies is released on 26 April on digital platforms.",Laddie: The Man Behind the Movies,FILM
293,Homeward review – a moving modern-day Crimean war story,"Mustafa (Akhtem Seitablayev), a grizzled farmer with a profile as unforgiving as an axe head, and his estranged younger son Alim (Remzi Bilyalov) are united in grief. They are flung together by the death of Nazim, the older son and brother, but have little else in common, in this arresting feature debut by Nariman Aliev. But as their journey from Kyiv in Ukraine to their Crimean homeland unfolds, with the shrouded and ripening body of Nazim in the back of the car, the bonds of blood and an embattled shared culture – they are Crimean Tatars – incrementally overcome even the most deeply rooted of personal differences. Aliev is himself a Tatar, and all of his short films to date have dealt with his people and heritage. Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 shone a spotlight on the region, but the roots of this particular story run further and deeper. The taciturn disapproval of the father and the cowed silence of his son result in few opportunities for exposition within the sparse dialogue, but we piece together enough to learn that Mustafa’s family, like nearly 200,000 other Tatars, were deported from Crimea just after the second world war. Once they were allowed to return, Mustafa made it his life’s mission to carve out a place for his sons on the land. It’s beyond his comprehension that they would reject it. Elegant framing makes striking use of a generous widescreen aspect ratio, but the film’s main asset is a deft screenplay that subtly reverses the roles of father and son as the journey progresses. Mustafa’s rigidity is softened by failing health and the realisation that not all encounters are battles – a kite-flying scene has a soul-soaring beauty and simplicity. And after a bonding moment in which his father coaches him in the best way to kill a man, Alim hardens as he shoulders the responsibility for his bloodline.

294,Sisters With Transistors review – a gloriously geeky music doc,"What a joy is a documentary that neither talks down to its audience nor diminishes its subject. Lisa Rovner’s Sisters With Transistors is an unapologetically geeky look at the female pioneers of early electronic music which veers fearlessly into the experimental end of the knob-twiddling spectrum. Laurie Anderson narrates a fascinating film that takes in, among others, theremin virtuoso Clara Rockmore; a beatifically smiling Suzanne Ciani sensually stroking a suitcase full of wires; Éliane Radigue, engrossed in her minimal tonal experiments; and the great Delia Derbyshire, with the mathematical precision of her diction and her demure slingback tapping to a throbbing loop of noise. Particularly glorious is footage of the sound installation artist Maryanne Amacher blasting Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore with pure volume. A mix of fear and exhilaration in his eyes, face quivering in the force of the buffeting sound waves, he looks like a dog putting its head out of a moving car window for the very first time.

295,Oscars ratings down 58% to new record low,"The Oscars telecast suffered another major dip in viewership this year, with early ratings suggesting a 58% drop. The ceremony, which saw on-the-road drama Nomadland pick up the top prize, was watched by 9.85 million Americans, down from 23.6 million in 2020, according to preliminary Nielsen numbers. That year, which was led by a historic win for Parasite, was already the least watched televised ceremony ever for the Academy. It was an unusual evening, heavily affected by the pandemic, with a more modest guest list and venue, with many nominees only appearing via video. It was co-produced by Steven Soderbergh, who decided to make some major and controversial changes with both structure and style. When asked about ratings earlier this month, he expressed indifference. “We’re worrying about things that we can control and that’s not on that list,” he told the Hollywood Reporter. “We’re just making something that we would want to see, that we would think is a good show, because if you’re doing anything other than that, you’re second guessing and you’re lost.” His production scored middling reviews from critics, with Vanity Fair’s Richard Lawson writing that it contained “more languor than pizzaz” and Variety’s Caroline Framke suggesting that “rearranging the metaphorical furniture isn’t the compelling twist that is going to bring them back”. Due to semi-shuttered cinemas, Nomadland, which went directly to Hulu as well as a handful of US screens, is set to be the lowest-grossing best picture winner for decades. A recent survey also showed that audiences were less familiar with the nominees than normal with just 35% of those asked having awareness of Nomadland, for instance. The night’s big acting awards were given to Frances McDormand, Daniel Kaluuya, Youn Yuh-jung and Anthony Hopkins, who wasn’t able to give a winner’s speech. The news follows on from similarly dramatic falls for other pandemic-era award shows. Last year’s Emmys were the lowest ever with a 12% drop, this year’s Golden Globes fell around 60% while the Grammys were down 53% year on year.",Oscars ceremony,OTHERS
296,Labyrinth of Cinema review – cult Japanese director’s epic blitz of pop-culture hyperactivity,"Nobuhiko Ôbayashi is the Japanese film-maker who directed the cult 1977 horror Hausu, or House, and in his long and prolific career also specialised in TV ads starring American movie actors for the domestic market (satirised in Sofia Coppola’s Lost in Translation). Just before his death last year, at the age of 82, he completed this film, his valediction to cinema, to Japan and to life: an epic blitz of pop-culture hyperactivity: baffling, surreal, tragicomic, then simply tragic. At first, it looks as if it is going to be a sentimental lump-in-the-throat elegy to cinema-going’s golden age. But then it takes us to the heart of Japanese darkness: the second world war and the atomic bomb. In the present day, a movie theatre in Onomichi, near Hiroshima, is playing an all-nighter of war movies and three guys in the audience, cinephile Mario (Takuro Atsuki), owlishly bespectacled Shigeru (Yoshihiko Hosoda) and yakuza tough guy Hosuke (Takahito Hosoyamada) are so entranced that they are magically transported through the screen and into the films. There they repeatedly encounter a mysterious little girl called Noriko (Rei Yoshida), a symbol of innocence and hope. Everything but the kitchen sink is thrown into the mix: there are cameos for John Ford and Yasujiro Ozu, there are hints of Kubrick and MGM musicals. There are war-movie sequences that may have been inspired by Fred Zinnemann’s From Here to Eternity or even Richard Lester’s How I Won the War. In the 19th century, there are battles against the Chinese, led by the fierce Lt Sako, played by veteran Japanese star Tadanobu Asano. In the 20th, we see fanatical Japanese soldiers ordering thousands of civilians at Okinawa to commit suicide rather than submit to the Americans. Finally our trio of anti-war anti-heroes encounter a travelling theatre troupe whose casting problems mean that on 6 August 1945 they might have to play an unscheduled show in Hiroshima: the three men desperately sign up as replacement actors to keep them away from this terrible time and place. Their play is The Rickshaw Man – adapted by Hiroshi Inagaki in 1943, and remade in 1958 with screen icon Toshiro Mifune. Labyrinth of Cinema is indeed labyrinthine, a maze of jokes, film references, quirky back projections, bargain-basement effects and melodramatic confrontations. But at its centre is something deeply serious: a belief that, as the sole country to have experienced a nuclear strike, Japan has a terrifying exceptionalism. This awful truth is marked by a tonal cymbal-clash, both acidly comic and desperately sad. • Labyrinth of Cinema is available on 27 April on Mubi.",Labyrinth of Cinema,FILM
297,Anthony Hopkins becomes oldest-ever Oscar winner after taking best actor for The Father,"Anthony Hopkins has won the best actor Oscar at the 93rd Academy Awards in Los Angeles. Hopkins, 83, won for his performance as an elderly man with dementia in The Father, directed by French novelist and playwright Florian Zeller, who also wrote the acclaimed stage play on which the film is based. It is Hopkins’ second best actor victory – he won in 1992 for his role as Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs. He had also been nominated for his leading roles in The Remains of the Day and Nixon, as well as for supporting parts in The Two Popes and Amistad. The victory makes Hopkins the oldest ever Oscar winner acting, an honour previously held by the late Christopher Plummer, who was 82 when he won for Beginners in 2011. Hopkins’ win consolidated a late surge of momentum for the actor in this year’s race, following his victory at the Baftas a fortnight ago. The Oscars favourite had been the late Chadwick Boseman for his role in Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom. Also up for this year’s prize were fellow Britons Gary Oldman (for Mank) and Riz Ahmed (The Sound of Metal) as well as the Asian American actor Steven Yuen for Minari. Yuen and Ahmed’s inclusion marked the first time two Asian actors had been shortlisted in the best actor category. Hopkins did not pick up his award in person and the anticipated victory speech delivered in his honour by Olivia Colman in London did not materialise. His award crowned a highly unusual Oscars ceremony, which ended shortly after it was announced. • This article was amended on 26 April 2021.

298,Frances McDormand wins third best actress Oscar for Nomadland,"Frances McDormand has won the best actress Oscar for Nomadland at the 93rd Academy Awards, which are taking place in Los Angeles. McDormand plays one of a group of retirees struggling to make ends meet, alongside a cast largely made up of non-professional actors. Written and directed by Chloé Zhao, the film was inspired by Jessica Bruder’s non-fiction book Nomadland: Surviving America in the Twenty-First Century. This is McDormand’s third best actress Oscar: she took the prize for Fargo in 1997 and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri in 2o18. Only Katharine Hepburn, with four, has won more best actress Oscars. McDormand was considered a strong favourite for the award having won best actress at the Baftas, but still had to defeat a strong field, including Viola Davis for Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom and Carey Mulligan in Promising Young Woman. “We should add a karaoke bar,” said McDormand in her speech, delivered shortly after coming off stage to help accept Nomadland’s best picture win. “I have no words. My voice is in my sword. We know the sword is our work and I like work.

299,Nomadland wins best picture Oscar as Chloé Zhao makes history with best director win,"Nomadland has won the best picture Oscar at the 93rd Academy Awards. A study of retirees struggling to make ends meet, Nomadland stars Frances McDormand alongside a group of non-professional actors, and is directed by Chinese-American film-maker Chloé Zhao. The film was inspired by Jessica Bruder’s non-fiction book Nomadland: Surviving America in the Twenty-First Century. Unusually, the best picture award was not the last of the night, being announced before the awards for best actor and best actress. Nomadland defeated strong competition for the Oscar, including The Father, a heart-rending study of dementia starring Anthony Hopkins; Mank, a biopic of Citizen Kane scriptwriter Herman J Mankiewicz; and Promising Young Woman, the rape-revenge comedy drama starring Carey Mulligan. Director Chloé Zhao paid tribute to her film-making team saying: “We thank all the hearts and hands that came together to make this movie,” and thanked the real-life subjects of the film, who also appeared in front of the screen: “Thank you for teaching us the power of resilience and for teaching us what kindness is.” The film’s lead performer, Frances McDormand, also spoke briefly, asking viewers to “please watch out movie on the largest screen possible” as well as the other nominees. She finished by saying: “We give this one to our wolf,” and howled – in what is thought to be a reference to Nomadland’s sound mixer Michael Wolf Snyder who died in March, aged 35. Earlier in the evening, Zhao made history after she became the first female director of colour to win the Oscar for best director, but Nomadland failed to pick up awards for best editing and best cinematography. However, Frances McDormand went on to win the best actress Oscar. The film had previously won a string of accolades, including the Golden Lion at the Venice film festival, best motion picture (drama) at the Golden Globes, and best film at the Baftas. • Chloé Zhao becomes first woman of colour to win best director Oscar • Frances McDormand wins third best actress Oscar for Nomadland",Nomadland,FILM

However, she did explain that she “usually just watches the Oscar on television”. “Me being here myself I cannot believe.

Neal, the department head, and Wilson, Viola Davis’s personal hair stylist, won for their work on the film about one of the few openly lesbian, black performers in America in the 1920s. Neal, who designed Oprah Winfrey’s wigs for 2017’s The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, created 100 wigs for Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom in less than three weeks, based on the fewer than 10 photographs that exist of the legendary “mother of blues”, according to Vogue. “I know that one day it won’t be unusual or groundbreaking, it will just be normal” for black women, trans women, and Latinas to be claiming Oscars, Neal said. The film’s costume designer, Ann Roth, 89, also made history as the oldest woman to win an Oscar, tying Agnés Varda and James Ivory for the oldest winners. While celebrating her work, the presenter Don Cheadle said Roth “reads the script and asks herself questions about the character like: ‘When she goes to bed, where are those clothes? Do they fall on the floor? Does she hang them up?’ From there, Ann builds the costumes which define the character.” Roth did not give a remote speech, and Cheadle accepted on the Academy’s behalf.

In the film, Mikkelsen plays a teacher who tries to combat his depression by following a theory that a high blood-alcohol level results in greater personal happiness. The Guardian’s chief film critic Peter Bradshaw called it “persuasive and watchable” in a three-star review. Another Round is the fourth Danish film to win the best international film Oscar, following Babette’s Feast in 1988, Pelle the Conqueror in 1989, and In a Better World in 2011.

He concluded by paying tribute to his daughter, Ida, who died shortly after the shoot began aged 19. “We wanted to make a film that celebrates life,” he said, “and four days into shooting the impossible happened. An accident on a highway took my daughter away. Someone looking at their cellphone. We miss her and we love her.” Vinterberg continued by explaining he had received an enthusiastic letter from his daughter two months before shooting when she was in Africa and had just read the script: “She loved this and she felt seen by this.” “We made this to her as her monument.

310,Beast Beast review – insultingly shallow take on gun violence,"Here’s another indie flick that mistakes handheld camera movements for emotional intimacy. Produced by Alec Baldwin, Danny Madden’s second feature has a host of characters and storylines that are just as empty and unfocused as the migraine-inducing cinematography. Revolving around of group of multi-ethnic Gen Z-ers in the American south, this message-heavy film tries hard to tackle urgent issues such as social media, familial conflicts and, above all, gun violence. The film only succeeds at peddling barely tolerable coming-of-age cliches. The kids in Beast Beast hail from all walks of life. There is Krista (Shirley Chen), a spunky Asian theatre kid who blooms on stage yet wilts at home in the presence of her neglectful parents. She is charmed by Nito (Jose Angeles), a new Latino student from a much rougher side of town with a knack for skateboarding tricks. Looming over their sweet rendezvous is the quietly unsettling presence of Adam (Will Madden), a white firearms “enthusiast” who is obsessed with making gun vlogs. He rarely leaves his parents’ home and prefers stewing over malicious online comments. As the first hour of the film lolls along, full of prickly yet mostly innocent adolescent incidents, but with a sense of malevolence lingering via a recurrent menacing musical interlude full of clanging noises. After all, the Chekhov gun is there and indeed, it unsurprisingly fires to bloody results in the third act. Without giving anything away, the film’s condemnation of gun violence is gratingly shallow, favouring melodramatic histrionics that produce iffy racial optics as brutality is repeatedly inflicted upon the non-white characters. Beast Beast also appears to have done zero research into how a community responds to these kind of tragedies or how the justice system even works. Clearly, the film cares more about checking off liberal talking points than lending its characters any real depth. Such simplistic posturing is, frankly, pretty insulting. • Beast Beast is released on 30 April on digital platforms.",Beast Beas,FILM
311,"The Bike Thief review – a clear-eyed, unsentimental study of immigrant life","A modern update on Vittorio De Sica’s neorealist classic Bicycle Thieves, Matt Chambers’ feature debut pays the same attention and care to the day-to-day struggles of the urban working class. The refusal to either romanticise or overly dramatise it makes for especially poignant results and the clear-eyed, unsentimental approach renders the characters’ turmoil even more tragic. The film draws viewers in with a kind of urban poetry. The camera closely follows a pizza delivery man on his scooter as he zips through traffic, his figure wrapped in the hues of city lights. The halogen flares, however, quickly turn unforgiving, just like the inhospitable environment engulfing this precarious line of work. Initially seen only as a helmet-covered-face in the crowd, the figure emerges as the deliberately unnamed protagonist, credited only as the Rider (played by God’s Own Country’s Alec Secăreanu). The character’s namelessness places him in a generalised working class, but the film also fleshes out the specifics of Romanian immigrant life in London, beautifully imbued with a wealth of visual details. The vastness of the big city contrasts with the cramped apartment that he shares with his wife Elena (Anamaria Marinca), their teenage daughter and perpetually wailing baby. Though a testament to financial hardship, this space also glows with a familial tenderness that is a refuge from the daily hustle and bustle. However, all of this threatens to fall apart when his scooter is stolen, prompting the mild-mannered Rider to embark on a dark path. Secăreanu is just as intensely memorable here as in God’s Own Country, displaying a deliberate restraint that is even more haunting when it finally cracks. Considering Marinca was such an engaging presence in the Romanian new wave classic 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days, it is a pity that her character isn’t given more to do; perhaps it’s best read as a commentary on the even tougher existence endured by female immigrants. As a result, The Bike Thief is significantly weaker than it might have been, though as a character study it’s still compelling. • The Bike Thief is released on 3 May on digital platforms.",The Bike Thief,FILM
312,"Aviva review – an experimental study of  love, sex and gender","Watch the first 60 seconds of this experimental feature from Israeli-American director Boaz Yakin – it’s a love story with plenty of sex and expressionist dancing – and you’ll get a taste of the bizarreness to come. A naked woman sits on a bed and explains to camera that she’s acting in the film. Her name is Bobbi Jene Smith and she’s a dancer and choreographer by trade, not an actor. But given the dancing required by the script, she says, the film-makers have hired dancers to do the acting. Oh, and she’s playing a man. This is not the last time director Yakin takes a sledgehammer to the fourth wall, and his deeply personal film is deeply exasperating at times, a bit indulgent and at least 20 minutes too long. It’s tells a timeworn tale of a man and woman falling in love only to be confronted with the harsh reality of living together. The woman is Aviva (Zina Zinchenko), a fierce and emotional video artist from Paris. The guy is American, Eden (Tyler Phillips), and their romance begins over email. The scene where the two meet in person is gorgeous: long tracking shots of both dancing through their cities towards each other. The pair’s athleticism and the emotional fluency of their bodies is exhilarating and beautiful. But the film’s big experiment feels only semi-interesting. The roles of Aviva and Eden are also performed by another two actors, a man and a woman (a little nod possibly to Buñuel’s That Obscure Object of Desire). So sometimes Aviva is a balefully sexy guy (Or Schraiber), while Bobbi Jene Smith appears as a female Eden. No one around them seems to notice, and you wonder what Yakin’s film is saying here about gender. When Eden is sulky and withdrawn, his female counterpart arrives on screen to show us his emotionally intuitive side. Maybe I’m reading it wrong, but is the point here that differences between the sexes are hardwired? Or that we each have male and female sides? Either way, it feels reductive. • Aviva is released on 30 April on digital platforms.",Aviva,FILM
313,Chadwick Boseman’s family defends Anthony Hopkins amid best actor Oscars backlash,"The family of Chadwick Boseman, the Black Panther star who had been widely expected to receive a posthumous best actor Oscar for his role in Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, have come to the defence of the man who took the prize. The brother of the actor, who died last August of cancer aged 43, says the family had no hard feelings towards Anthony Hopkins. Speaking to TMZ, Derrick Boseman said his brother would have been the first to wish Hopkins the best following his Sunday night win. The late actor would have seen winning an Oscar as an achievement but never an “obsession” said Boseman, adding that he felt all the shortlisted actors were worthy of the award. The surprise result on Sunday night was compounded by the absence of Hopkins from the telecast and the switch in the running order. Rather than the traditional finish of the award of best picture, best actress and best actor concluded the ceremony, with many suspecting that the producers had anticipated a win for Boseman, which would have concluded the ceremony on a particular note. Instead, there was simply Hopkins’s abrupt and anti-climatic absence to finish the ceremony, its jarring nature compounded by the lack of a host. This year’s Oscars had what had been understood to be a strict “no Zoom” policy that meant nominees needed to either turn up in Los Angeles or in one of the “hubs” – including one at the BFI Southbank in London. Hopkins, who is 83, is currently in Wales and evidently didn’t fancy the trip. It had been thought that his The Father co-star, Olivia Colman, would be permitted to accept the award for him from the London hub. But this is now not believed to be the case, despite Colman having been in attendance, at least for the early part of proceedings, when she was nominated for best supporting actress for the film. Awards pundit Kyle Buchanan suggested earlier today that Hopkins had offered to be on call overnight on video but was refused by the Academy, who also stuck to their protocol of having a presenter accept non-posthumous awards (rather than a co-star) in the event of non-attendance. Hopkins, who posted a video from his late father’s grave earlier on Sunday, posted a video expressing thanks on Monday morning, saying he did not expect to win, and that he was “very grateful to the Academy”. “I want to pay tribute to Chadwick Boseman,” he added, “who was taken from us far too early.”",Chadwick Boseman’s family,OTHERS
314,Identifying Features review – horror and heartbreak in Mexico’s borderlands,"There is unbearable heartbreak in this migrant drama from first-time Mexican film-maker Fernanda Valadez – and also a vision of real evil. At times, it looks something like social-realist folk horror. Mercedes Hernández plays Magdalena, a middle-aged woman from Guanajuato in central Mexico whose teenage son Jesús left home three years before, with a friend, on a bus bound for the border, where he’d hoped to take his chances on disappearing into the US as an illegal. But the body of Jesús’s friend has been found on Mexican territory, in an unspeakably grim holding area where the corpses of teen runaways are routinely kept in container boxes awaiting identification – though there is still no proof that Jesús himself is dead. Magdalena sets out on a quest to find her son in the terrifyingly dangerous borderlands where bandits waylay buses for vulnerable passengers who can be robbed, raped, or trafficked. On the way, Magdalena comes across a teenage boy called Miguel (David Illescas) who is making the opposite journey; just deported from the US, he is now miserably trying to find his mother. Of course, the two travel together, and for a while the film appears to be inviting us to predict a bittersweet, figurative ending: that is, Magdalena will “find” Miguel as someone who is very like her son; he will “find” her too in the same way and there will be a crumb of comfort in each other’s company. Identifying Features is indeed about that, but the ending is much darker, more dramatic and sensational with an undertow of spiritual horror: quite unselfconsciously and unapologetically, Valadez invokes the image of Satan. This film (the original title is actually Sin señas particulares, or No Identifying Features) is a cry of rage or a cry for help, on behalf of people in Mexico who have been abandoned to lawlessness, corruption and the vast market forces created by its northern neighbour. • Identifying Features is released on 1 May on BFI Player.",Identifying Features,FILM
315,Disney unapologetic over Mulan credit thanking Chinese Communist party,"Disney has claimed it was not responsible for thanking the Chinese Communist party in the credits at the end of the film Mulan, saying the decision was taken by local contractors. In a letter to the Commons business select committee, the film company is unapologetic about its refusal to accept a request to give evidence in person to the committee. Disney also says it was required to comply with Chinese laws at all times. Disney has been widely criticised by British politicians for filming parts of Mulan in Xinjiang province where there are widespread claims, including by the British government, that human rights abuses are being carried out on the Uyghur people by the Chinese Communist party. The letter sent by Sean Bailey, the president of Walt Disney studios motion pictures, says: “Chinese regulations prohibit foreign producers from operating independently and require them to partner with a Chinese production company.” It explains Disney hired Beijing Shadow Times Culture, a private company it said had worked with , “to provide production-related services in China”. Those mentioned in the movie’s credits for thanks include the publicity department of CPC Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Committee and the police bureau in Turpan, an ancient Silk Road city in eastern Xinjiang that has a large Uyghur population. “It is standard practice across the film industry worldwide to acknowledge in a film’s credits the cooperation, approvals and assistance provided by various entities and Disney individuals over the course of a film’s production,” Bailey wrote. “In this case, the production company, Beijing Shadow Times, provided our production team with the list of acknowledgments to be included in the credits for Mulan. The Walt Disney Company has no separate, independent or ongoing relationship with government authorities in the Xinjiang autonomous province.” The filming in Xinjiang only lasted four days, the company added. The company filmed the bulk of Mulan in New Zealand, but for reasons of authenticityused 20 locations throughout China, including the Kumtag Desert in Xinjiang, home to an important passageway along the Silk Road. Disney said: “The decision to film in each of these locations was made by the film’s producers in the interest of authenticity, and was in no way dictated or influenced by state or local Chinese officials.” China has vehemently rejected claims of a genocide as a lie, although the foreign minister Nigel Adams this week said it was a step forward that China admits the detention camps exist.",Disney,OTHERS

317,Tom Clancy’s Without Remorse review – macho adventure plays by the book,"In the last few years, screenwriter Taylor Sheridan brought something steely and smart to the action genre with the drug-cartel thriller Sicario and its politically provocative sequel Sicario 2, a Trumpian nightmare of border-incursion, directed by Stefano Sollima. Sheridan and Sollima are reunited for this movie, but it is a by-the-numbers macho adventure not unlike something from the era of VHS rental, Rambo and tough-guy military mavericks being sold down the river by the pointy-headed creeps in suits back in Washington DC or Langley, home of the CIA. This film is based on Tom Clancy’s 1993 bestseller, originally set during the Vietnam war, but now updated to the situation in Syria. Michael B Jordan is Navy Seal John Clark, whose pregnant wife is murdered on US soil, apparently by FSB agents in revenge for John taking out Russian special forces in Aleppo as part of a hostage rescue. So Without Remorse becomes essentially an unidirectional revenge story, as John is permitted back into the field on a deniable “black ops” payback mission. His friend and ally Karen (Jodie Turner-Smith, from Queen &amp; Slim) has John’s back and secretary of defense Clay (Guy Pearce) rather approves of his heroically unconventional methods – though slippery CIA chief Ritter (Jamie Bell) seems to be running some kind of side-hustle which involves appeasing the Russians. So whose side is this guy on? This is a film that certainly gives you bangs for your buck and establishment stabs in the back – a sine qua non for this kind of story. And with an awful inevitability, John Clark’s ultimate bad guy emerges from the shadows with some outrageous geopolitical monologuing in the approved supervillain style – prior to a post-credits sting setting up a possible superhero-type franchise along the lines author Tom Clancy envisioned. But there’s not much real spark to it. • Tom Clancy’s Without Remorse is released on 30 April on Amazon Prime Video.",Without Remorse,FILM
318,Danny. Legend. God. review – Borat-style mockumentary about Bulgarian wideboy,"It’s to debut director Yavor Petkov’s credit that, with his coke-hoovering Balkans wideboy Danny, he has created an extremely annoying cinematic character to rival Steven Stifler of American Pie, Jim Carrey’s Cable Guy and Jar Jar Binks. Petkov however, has done it on purpose – and his mockumentary about a hipster film crew following around this smalltown councillor-cum-petty mafioso, played by Dimo Alexiev, blossoms into a deeply uncomfortable viewing experience. The set-up is this: Danny takes Susan (Kate Nichols) and her British crew under his wing to show them around his Bulgarian town. Ostensibly taking part in a documentary on money-laundering, this mean-faced braggart has no shame and operates an access-all-areas policy: they film him berating the local “peasants”, scope out the chocolate factory he’s planning, and watch him bully a bank official. If they didn’t already know they’d snagged a live one, Danny insists they film him receiving a blowjob back at his nightclub. “This is not your project any more,” he raves. “The script is here – in my head!” This act of PR hijacking is mostly plotless, until the disgusted Susan quits, leaving soundman Jaime (James Ryan Babson) – who Danny insists on calling “Junkie” – and the anonymous cameraman to finish whatever it is they’re doing. Petkov starts out in something close to Borat territory, ribbing this arriviste nightmare’s bogus orthodoxy, influencer girlfriends and inability to abuse steroids properly. But Danny is so domineering that he steadily crushes the distance needed for dramatic irony, and the satire transforms into something more hard-faced: a hit job on corruption, and the cult of the neo-capitalist hardman in the former eastern bloc. The film is overlong and paced like a three-day coke jag. And a final point that the naive crew – and by extension, westerners in general – are guilty of wanting to vicariously lap up off-the-chain depictions of exotic locales doesn’t land with the same impact as reflections on spectatorship in the similar Man Bites Dog. It is a bit of a stretch that Danny, no matter what his drug intake, would incriminate himself in front of an international film crew – but the outstanding Alexiev, lurching at the camera with menacing hospitality, sells the character perfectly.

319,80-year-old review wrecks Citizen Kane’s 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes,"An 80-year-old pseudonymous review appears to have wrecked Citizen Kane’s 100% rating on reviews aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes. A Twitter user pointed out the change in Citizen Kane’s rating, due to the addition of a negative review from 1941. It is not clear exactly when the change happened, but website Boing Boing suggested it must have been between 25 February and 15 April, after comparing archived screenshots. The review was originally published in the Chicago Tribune on 7 May 1941, under the headline “‘Citizen Kane’ fails to impress critic as greatest film ever made”, a week after its first release in New York and a day after its Chicago premiere. The writer, credited as Mae Tinee (a play on “matinee”) comments: “It’s interesting. It’s different. In fact, it’s bizarre enough to become a museum piece. But its sacrifice of simplicity to eccentricity robs it of distinction and general entertainment value,” adding: “I only know it gives one the creeps and that I kept wishing they’d let a little sunshine in.” The review implies that Citizen Kane’s status as the greatest movie of all time was already in play before it was released. This was possibly as response to a hostile campaign by its presumed subject, newspaper magnate WR Hearst, to suppress the film and attack Welles after he found out about it in January 1941 via feared gossip columnist Hedda Hopper. It was named best film of all time in Sight and Sound magazine’s decennial critics poll in 1962, retaining the position until 2012 when it was overtaken by Alfred Hitchcock’s Vertigo. Interest in the creative process behind Citizen Kane has been reawakened by the release of Mank, a biopic of its writer Herman J Mankiewicz, directed by David Fincher and starring Gary Oldman. Mank won two Oscars, for cinematography and production design. Reports that Citizen Kane had been “replaced” as the No 1 film by Paddington 2 on Rotten Tomatoes appear to be wide of the mark however. Rotten Tomatoes weighted list places the 1934 comedy It Happened One Night in first place, with Black Panther and Lady Bird in second and third. Paddington 2 is at no 31, but it is the highest placed film with a 100% critics rating.",80-year-old review,OTHERS
320,The Resort review – inane horror film or a sophisticated meta-joke?,"Four friends who look like models take a trip to a remote Hawaiian island to check out a shuttered resort where spooky, unnatural things happened years ago. Apparently, the place is haunted by the vengeful ghost of a native girl whose face was mutilated back then. Will anyone survive to write a TripAdvisor review? This inane horror movie is so ludicrously cliche-ridden one starts to wonder if it’s not some kind of sophisticated meta-joke being played on us. How else can we account for choices such as having the whole thing told as a flashback from a hospital bed, by sole survivor Lex (Bianca Haase)? Is it some kind of nudge in the proverbial ribs that, as we see the quartet strip off to swim near a waterfall, we hear Lex intone solemnly that this was the last time they were happy? (Spoiler: because everyone is going to die.) And was writer-director-producer Taylor Chien hoping to use this as a calling card to get a gig making episodes of Love Island? Or did he and his friends just fancy a holiday in Hawaii? Whatever the answers to these and other questions may be, there’s no doubting that this film was more fun to make than it is to watch, although there is a sort of guilty pleasure in the spectacle of ruins and decay and wondering whether the film-makers actually found a real abandoned resort, or if it’s all a set. • The Resort is released on 30 April on digital platforms.",The Resort,FILM
321,‘Like a Starbucks’: Elton John and Donald Trump deliver damning Oscars verdicts,"Elton John was among celebrities expressing his disappointment with this year’s Oscars ceremony, the telecast of which was watched by 58% fewer people than last year. “The Oscar ceremony looks like it’s coming from a Starbucks somewhere,” John remarked to co-host Neil Patrick Harris at his annual – and this year, virtual – viewing party. John was commenting on the new, socially distanced venue at Los Angeles’s Union Station. “I still can’t get over the set,” he added. John later clarified that his chief disappointment was pandemic-related. “I wish we could be there. It’s more fun. This is the only way we could do it.” Meanwhile, Donald Trump issued a statement from Mar-a-Lago decrying this year’s event. “What used to be called the Academy Awards, and now is called the “Oscars” – a far less important and elegant name – had the lowest television ratings in recorded history,” he began. “If they keep with the current ridiculous formula, it will only get worse – if that’s possible.” Trump credited the fall in ratings to “political correctness” and the Hollywood elite silencing Republicans. Late-night chatshow host Jimmy Kimmel mocked both parties on his show, saying: “Trump basically is the Oscars – old, bloated, completely self-involved and obsessed with gold.” He also read out a spoof statement from the Academy, aping Trump’s unusual phrasing and grammar with the postscript “Our show SUCKED this year because you gave everybody Covid.”",Elton John,OTHERS
322,Threshold review – road trip out of hell in iPhone horror,"In some corner of a US nowheresville town, sad-sack musician-schoolteacher Leo (Joey Millin) gets a call from his mom begging him to pick up his screw-up of a sister Virginia (Madison West). Virginia has had an on-off problem with drugs that ruined a once promising law career. Leo is sceptical of her latest excuse for being found in a squalid apartment looking high, even though there are no obvious track marks: she claims satanic jiggery-pokery has fused her bodily sensations with that of an unknown man, so she feels all his pain and pleasure and vice versa. She has no idea where he is – but carving “where r u?” into her arm prompts a handy reply with precise coordinates. So off Leo and Virginia go, for a family road trip. Most of the running time is spent in close quarters with Leo and Virginia as they reminisce about their childhoods and the ups and downs of their adult lives in mumblecore fashion between bouts of spooky stuff to remind us of the horror-movie reason we here. The jarring shifts in register recall other offbeat, supernatural road movies such as Ben Wheatley’s Kill List, but the direction from collaborators Powell Robinson and Patrick Robert Young is less assured and the performances don’t have the same spontaneity. It doesn’t help that Young’s script is thin on wit, while the sound on the version I saw left much to be desired. That latter problem may have something to do with the fact that the whole thing was shot on iPhones, a gimmick that was charming, cruddy-cool and texturally fascinating when Sean Baker did it with Tangerine in 2015, but which looks dated now and just plain cruddy. • Threshold is available from 3 May on Arrow.",Threshold,FILM
323,Polanski announces first new film since being expelled from Academy,"Roman Polanski has announced his first film to be put into production since the director was expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (Ampas) in 2018. According to Variety, Polanski has secured backing from Italian media giant Rai Cinema for The Palace, a drama Polanski has co-written with fellow Polish film-maker Jerzy Skolimowski. Rai Cinema’s CEO Paolo Del Brocco said that The Palace is set on New Year’s Eve in 1999, and is about “a big hotel immersed in the Swiss Alps where the lives of the guests and those who work for them intersect”. Del Brocco added: “I know that Polanski carries some controversy, but we are interested in the artistic side. The quality of the stories, not the personal story.” Polanski, who is still wanted in the United States after he admitted the statutory rape of a 13-year-old girl in 1977, has become a major target for #MeToo campaigners in France. In 2020 he won a César, France’s equivalent to the Oscars, for best director for his previous film An Officer and a Spy, about the Dreyfus affair, sparking protests and walkouts, including by Portrait of a Lady on Fire’s Adèle Haenel. At the time, Ursula Le Menn, an activist with campaign group Osez le Féminisme, said: “For women who have had the courage to speak out about the abuse they suffered, there is an enormous pain seeing this man distinguished.” Polanski was expelled from Ampas in 2018 “in accordance with the organisation’s standards of conduct”. He subsequently lost a court case that would have forced his reinstatement. Polanski had been arrested in Switzerland in 2009 in relation to the outstanding US warrant against him, but was freed from house arrest 10 months later by the Swiss authorities. Rai Cinema was involved in An Officer and a Spy, which was first announced in 2012, before finally going before cameras in November 2018. Skolimowski was a contemporary of Polanski’s during the Polish “new wave” of the 1960s, co-writing Polanski’s debut feature Knife in the Water. In the 1970s and 80s he made a much-admired trilogy of films in the UK, Deep End, The Shout and Moonlighting.

324,Safer at Home review – gimmicky pandemic thriller feels very 2020,"Of all the awfulnesses rained down on us by coronavirus, down the list in 457th place is the return of the found-footage movie, back on our screens in the guise of the Zoom-call film. Last year’s nifty little chiller Host was a masterclass in how to do it: a subgenre high. Much less satisfying is this gimmicky and derivative pandemic thriller directed by Will Wernick about a drunken virtual party that gets out of hand. There is absolutely no sense of it being shot in real time and a strong whiff of phoniness hangs over the whole thing. Newsreel footage sets the scene. It’s America, summer 2022. After four waves of coronavirus, 31 million Americans are dead, and a nationwide night-time curfew is in place. Stuck at home in Los Angeles on his birthday making do with an online party is Evan (Dan J Johnson). His girlfriend Jen (Jocelyn Hudon) is with him; she’s pregnant but waiting till after the party to break the news. Their friends, joining online, feel like an assemblage of 90s sitcom stereotypes: a cute gay couple, Evan’s party-hard best mate and Jen’s singleton pal. At first, as the friends banter, the interplay between the actors feels a bit unnatural, aggressively upbeat. Then they drop ecstasy pills and the mood turns edgier. There’s an accident – or is it a crime? One of the group runs out into the city with the police in pursuit, and miraculously, while being chased by the cops, keeps his phone steady in his outstretched arm to film himself. The rest of the actors have to make do with staring at their computer screens with insincerely shocked and anxious faces; the lack of dramatic tension is all too apparent. And despite being set next year, Safer at Home already feels out of date.

325,The Virtuoso review – Anthony Hopkins on autopilot for dull hitman thriller,"This gloomy – literally so – thriller is set mostly over the course of one night, starting out with a big wodge of voiceover narration by the film’s unnamed hitman protagonist (Anson Mount), all of it using the second person voice with a cello sawing away in the background. For a minute your hopes are raised that this will be some kind of playful postmodern narrative, along the lines of Italo Calvino’s If on a Winter’s Night a Traveller, Robert Coover’s Noir, or even a pleasingly lurid Gen X study such as Jay McInerney’s Bright Lights, Big City. Alas, you are disappointed to learn this mystery story is much less clever than it thinks it is. Perhaps you should have twigged that earlier as the hitman, who considers himself a master of his trade, pretty much screws up every assignment he gets after his initial hit, where he shoots a man in flagrante delicto, splattering his partner with blood in the process. When the hitman complains to his boss – Anthony Hopkins (clearly slumming it before winning his second Oscar, and not even trying to fake the American accent required to play a grizzled Vietnam war vet) – about his feelings of guilt and despair about “collateral damage” (ie innocent people getting killed), you rightly suspect this is evidence that he doesn’t have the best judgment. At least, you sigh with resignation, the film had the good sense to give the role of a smalltown waitress to the too seldom cast Abbie Cornish, an actor with great range and subtlety who you hope will have more to do here than pour coffee and look sultry. When it’s all over and the big twist you saw coming in the first 15 minutes has been revealed, you feel empty, a bit depressed, and like you need another cup of coffee. • The Virtuoso is released on 30 April on digital platforms.",The Virtuoso,FILM
326,Sheep Without a Shepherd review – perky Chinese thriller that toes the line too carefully,"It turns out that cinephilia is a productive use of time after all. When his computer is searched, Li Weijie, protagonist of this perky Chinese thriller, has watched 838 films in a year – and he uses his superior knowledge of the seventh art to get his family out of a pickle. Chinese but living in northern Thailand, he scrapes by as an internet technician, but his daughter finds herself at the centre of a murder investigation after she accidentally kills the son of a police chief who was trying to blackmail her with smartphone-filmed rape footage. A remake of the 2013 Malayalam film Drishyam, this big Chinese hit ultimately doffs the cap to Korean cinema: it is Jeong Keun-seob’s 2013 film Montage that inspires Li when he has to provide his family with an alibi. The cat-and-mouse game that ensues is fairly engaging, rooted in two sturdy performances from the main combatants: Xiao Yang’s Li, with his outwardly dopey demeanour but operating with an intelligent pragmatism, and police chief Laoorn, a crack investigator played by Joan Chen with a turbulent confluence of steeliness and maternal anguish. The fine details of Li’s scheme are rather broadly relayed – something not helped by director Sam Quah’s over-eager rhythms. The film cites Hitchcock as the master of tension, and puts commendable effort in to devise similar set pieces. But often the results are a touch forced, as in one scene sparked by a goat noticing Li before the car he is attempting to dispose of sinks into a river. But Sheep Without a Shepherd gets the basics right and, as the town rises in anger in support of the family, it is swept along on a tide of indignation about police corruption and brutality. Given how pertinent a subject this is, it’s a shame about the film’s odd ending, with moralising overtones that make nonsense of Li’s reasons for earlier evading justice. It smacks of Production Code-type censorship and China Film Group, whose production this is, toeing the line on law and order. · Sheep Without a Shepherd is released on 26 April on digital platforms.",Sheep Without a Shepherd,FILM
327,The Artist’s Wife review – incomplete portrait of a dysfunctional marriage,"“I create the art. She creates the rest of life. Everything we do is up to Claire.” That’s painter Richard Smythson speaking, an artworld big gun, Jackson Pollock-meets-Philip Roth, played by Bruce Dern. He’s being interviewed in front of camera alongside his long-suffering wife Claire (Lena Olin). Her response is frozen on screen for a split second: a forced smile and behind it a flash of panicked terror and possibly rage. It’s a moment of clarity that triggers a late-marriage crisis in Tom Dolby’s tasteful drama, brilliantly acted but never entirely credible and not quite the force for feminism it wants to be. Pretty soon it’s clear what a pile of crock Richard’s comment is. He is a rampant narcissist, and Claire’s entire married life has been in service to his male genius. Years ago they moved from New York to the Hamptons, where she is isolated but he can paint without distraction. When he wakes up in the morning Claire has a coffee waiting for him; she buys his paintbrushes, cooks his dinners and soothes his ego. Dern plays Richard without a shred of vanity, cantankerous and shrivelled, his behaviour becoming more erratic with early dementia. Claire was an artist when she met him and starts to paint again in secret. Her regret crystallises at the opening of a show by an old friend, multimedia artist Ada Risi (Stefanie Powers, slightly overdoing bohemian), a woman who has always lived life on her own terms. Olin portrays Claire’s disappointment compellingly, with intelligence and gentle depth. Which is why it’s maddening that the camera’s gaze seems completely fixated on how phenomenally gorgeous she is. It reminded me of Amy Schumer’s Last Fuckable Day sketch; the point seems to be: “Look, she’s hot! At 66!” Would that happen to a male actor? • The Artist’s Wife is released on 30 April on digital platforms.",The Artist’s Wife,FILM
328,Here Are the Young Men review – Anya Taylor-Joy and the bad boys,"Here is an ensemble coming-of-ager in which someone actually says the line: “That summer may have changed everything …” It’s in a style I associate with the 90s: movies such as Trainspotting or Human Traffic, with people clubbing and yearning and discovering the value of friendship together as the sun comes up. There’s certainly an impressive cast lineup for this one, but there’s also something weirdly formless and frustrating about it as well; the film gestures at some dark and disturbing possibilities in human nature without quite knowing if or how to follow through. Matthew (Dean-Charles Chapman), Kearney (Finn Cole) and Rez (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) are three Dublin lads who leave school without much idea of what they want to do – not like their super-smart classmate Jen (Anya Taylor-Joy) who has some ambitious life plans figured out and on whom sweet, sensitive Matthew has a massive crush. But then the boys witness something horrible that shakes them up and reveals a sinister side to Kearney, who has a creepy attitude to Jen and a droog-like enthusiasm for torturing homeless people. Kearney is also very excited about his plans to spend some of the summer with his brother in glamorous America, and goes on to tell everyone back home about the limitless sex and drugs. The film periodically gives us highly stylised fantasy sequences showing a nightmarish American TV show, presided over by a gruesome Jerry Springer/Jeremy Kyle hybrid. It’s pretty redundant and obvious satire, and if Kearney really is supposed to be in America, and not just pathetically making it up, then his experiences out there have to be written off as a bit of an off-camera mystery. And Kearney is the unconvincing pretext for the film’s attempt to resolve the proceedings on a sombre, but sentimental note. Some strong performances from Cole, Chapman and Taylor-Joy nonetheless. • Here Are the Young Men is released on 30 April on digital platforms.",Here Are the Young Men,FILM
329,Truman & Tennessee: An Intimate Conversation review – reverently unrevealing,"A hushed tone of slightly maudlin reverence is the keynote of this well-meaning but somehow pointless dual-bio documentary from Lisa Immordino Vreeland about Tennessee Williams and Truman Capote: the two gay writers from the south who had colossal status in America’s artistic and celebrity circles in the 1950s and 60s when literature was taken very seriously and when homosexuality could be hidden in plain sight as part of the artistic temperament. Much of the archive footage is taken from TV interviews, and this was in an era when writers were honoured guests on talk shows. (Why, indeed, shouldn’t Graham Norton interview Sally Rooney or Jonathan Ross talk to Andrew O’Hagan on today’s TV?) The material, as so often, comes from that unselfconsciously high-minded TV interviewer Dick Cavett, and surely someone has to do a docu-biography of Cavett himself. Capote and Williams were sometimes rivals, sometimes frenemies but probably mostly friends. Yet, frustratingly, the point of this film is not to investigate the nature of that friendship as such: despite the title, there is nothing here equivalent to an “intimate conversation” between them, or that much of a conversation about literature, politics or homophobia. The film simply places Capote and Williams alongside each other as if in a diptych, and where the two are not directly present in archive footage, their words from interviews are spoken by actors: Jim Parsons for Capote and Zachary Quinto for Williams. The parallels continued into the third act. Both men suffered from substance abuse; both also suffered from career decline in the 70s and a gloomy sense of no longer being fashionable, although Capote was not savaged by the critics as Williams was, and managed to maintain a celeb profile through his connection with Andy Warhol. Perhaps Williams never achieved anything comparable to the radical breakthrough of Capote’s In Cold Blood, but, arguably, Capote’s work does not live on as Williams’s does, in theatre revivals all over the world. At the end of this documentary, nothing really original or insightful is really said about either man. • Truman &amp; Tennessee: An Intimate Conversation is available on digital platforms.",Truman & Tennessee: An Intimate Conversation,FILM
330,Wild Mountain Thyme review – Emily Blunt in an awful Irish stew,"There’s a sublime awfulness and condescension to this American vision of Ireland, adapted by writer-director John Patrick Shanley from his Broadway stage hit: a mind-boggling stew of bizarre paddywhackery that makes John Ford’s The Quiet Man look like a documentary about crack dealers. Two of its stars, Emily Blunt and Christopher Walken – both playing Irish people – engage in a colossal intergenerational battle for who can do the worst Irish accent. Blunt and Walken’s brogue-off makes this the King Kong v Godzilla event of inauthentic Irish voices. It’s supposed to be happening in the present day, but it might as well be happening in 1958. Blunt plays Rosemary, a beautiful, sharp-tongued farmer’s daughter in County Westmeath, and isn’t she in love with the soft eejit from the farm next door? The first time we see her, she is actually smoking a pipe, although the presumed “joke” status of that moment is undermined by the keynote of syrupy-poetic whimsy that dominates the rest of the movie. Her beloved is bashful and boyish Anthony, played by Jamie Dornan, who exasperatingly fails to romance her and wears a light macintosh that makes him look like Frank Spencer. Later, shy dreamer Anthony will murmur to the increasingly frustrated Rosemary that he believes himself to be a honeybee. The revelation that he also thinks that she is a flower is the romantic point. But for a while there, he looked like the star of some insidiously subtle psychological horror. But that’s not the least of it. Anthony’s cantankerous old farmer dad Tony (Walken) is threatening to disinherit his son and leave the land instead to his American nephew, played by Jon Hamm, who has a strange yearning to leave the world of Manhattan banking and be an Irish farmer – and the whole film is effectively endorsing and elevating this luxury-tourist daydream to a governing artistic principle. It’s a bit like Nancy Meyer’s The Holiday, and Rosemary is incidentally awarded a Pretty Woman-style moment of sobbing rapture at the ballet. I couldn’t help remembering how Anjelica Huston’s film Agnes Browne was based on the novel The Mammy by Brendan O’Carroll, who went on to develop the same story into the TV comedy Mrs Brown’s Boys. Maybe O’Carroll can take over Blunt’s role for a new show: Rosemary’s Roving Honeybee. • Wild Mountain Thyme is available on digital platforms.",Wild Mountain Thyme,FILM
331,The Mitchells vs the Machines review – a cranky AI gets her revenge,"Casting Olivia Colman as the voice of a demonic AI is only the first stroke of genius in this sprightly animated movie, produced by Phil Lord and Chris Miller (The Lego Movie, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse). As Pal, a passive-aggressive Siri-like program installed in everyone’s devices, she’s cranky, imperious and furious about being replaced by an updated model. “Just do what you always do and stare, slack-jawed, at the screen,” she says, witheringly, before her first act of violence: turning off the wifi. Meanwhile, artsy teen Katie Mitchell (Broad City’s Abbi Jacobson) is excited to leave Michigan for California, where she’ll start film school and finally “meet her people”. Her technophobic dad, Rick (Danny McBride), insists the whole family drive her, but the machine apocalypse ignited by Pal proves to be a roadblock along the way. The film retains a warm sense of humour about technology’s grip on society. Even mum Linda (Maya Rudolph) is addicted to her phone, Instagram-stalking the perfect Posey family (voiced by John Legend and Chrissy Teigen). There’s a playfulness, from an avalanche of possessed Furbys (and their oversized leader) to the goofy short films Katie makes (Monchi: Fear Eats the Soul riffs on Fassbinder and features her googly-eyed pug). The animation mixes CGI with 2D drawings scribbled over the images, as though Katie is doodling on the frame. The Mitchells vs the Machines is on Netflix",The Mitchells vs the Machines,FILM
332,Pariah Dog review – lyrical portrait of Kolkata’s canine carers,"The street dogs that feature in this lyrically-shot documentary aren’t strays, exactly; they are the indigenous, free-ranging “pye dogs” that have colonised India in large numbers and live fundamentally independently from humans. But interaction is not unknown, and this film turns its focus on a disparate set of individuals, all scraping by somehow, who take it on themselves to feed and minister to the animals. The most dramatic figure is the autocratic and argumentative Milly, getting by on dreams of former glory and always ready for a scrap, it seems, with the locals who she suggests are squatting on land she owns. (Part of her rage is directed at her “helper”, Kajal, who she would like to treat as a maid, but has no money to pay her. We also meet Pinaki, an artist who mourns the dead dogs he tried to help, and Subrata – seemingly the most emotional and committed – who walks the streets with bags of dog food, buys a Casio keyboard to play self-composed animal rights songs to a largely uninterested public, and dines out on his appearance on a TV quizshow. The parallel between the animals and their carers is clear – these are all marginal, fringe figures – but never forced by Canadian director Jessie Alk, who spent five years on the project; in fact, the whole thing is put together in a beautifully understated manner, with the human participants allowed to explain themselves on their own terms. There’s a pitiless clarity to the way the Kolkata streets are filmed: intentionally or not, they look like the world’s greatest film set, and the film serves equally well as a portrait of the metropolis. At 77 minutes, this is a brief inspection, but so heartfelt that it never seems too short. • Pariah Dog is available on 30 April on True Story.",Pariah Dog,FILM
333,Wild Mountain Thyme review – farcical farming romcom,"It would be unfair to spoil the twist at the end of this utterly bizarre romantic comedy by US writer-director John Patrick Shanley. Set in a greener-than-green Ireland, it follows Emily Blunt’s Rosemary as she struggles to win the affections of Jamie Dornan’s oblivious neighbouring farmer Anthony. There’s also a land dispute involving Anthony’s ailing father, Tony (Christopher Walken), and his sleazy American cousin (Jon Hamm). Shanley has an Oscar and a Pulitzer (he wrote the sublime Moonstruck, and the stage and screen versions of Doubt). Here, that’s easy to forget, given the cartoon accents and overblown metaphors about horses destined to jump the fence. When it’s eventually revealed why the handsome Anthony remains a bachelor, it’s beyond farce. Yet Dornan delivers the scream-inducing line with total earnestness. His commitment is a commendable feat of comic brilliance, not to be missed. Wild Mountain Thyme is on multiple digital platforms",Wild Mountain Thyme,FILM
334,Identifying Features review – a haunting portrayal of Mexico’s missing people,"Mexican film-maker Fernanda Valadez’s piercing feature debut is a sensitive exploration of her country’s missing persons crisis. Some 70,000 people have disappeared in Mexico in the past 15 years, and so Valadez reframes a faceless problem as a series of intersecting human stories. Single mother Magdalena (Mercedes Hernández) is able to identify her missing son’s bag but not his body. Unwilling to pronounce him dead, she searches for him across desolate landscapes, guided by recent deportee Miguel (David Illescas). A sunrise stains a lake pink, a violent flashback is blurry and unsubtitled; Valadez’s expressionist images give texture to the abstract emotions of rage and pain.
