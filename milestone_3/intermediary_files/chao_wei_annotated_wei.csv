"336 ","We Still Say Grace review – religious horror strays from the path of credibility              ","Nothing else in this schlocky horror-thriller comes anywhere close to matching its cheerfully grotesque opening. Harold, a white-bearded Bible-quoting hellfire fanatic (played by Bruce Davison), is presiding over a last supper; his wife and teenage daughters look terrified. After they’ve finished, he tells them that the wine was poisoned – they should prepare to meet their maker. Except it turns out not to be true. The whole thing is a sick test of the women’s submissiveness to him, their lord and master (though there is nothing godly about the way he squeezes his daughter’s knee). It is the last genuine moment of actual tension in this silly, derivative and wildly unconvincing film. Harold and his family live cut off from the modern world on a farm 30 miles from their closest neighbour. They dress in simple homemade clothes like the Amish and, crucially for the plot, don’t have a phone, a car or even a horse). Harold’s wife Betty (Arianne Zucker) and his eldest daughter Sarah (Rita Volk) are true believers, but the script is thunderingly uncurious about how they might be identifying with him as their abuser. Daughter number two, Maggie (Holly Taylor), reads books so we know she’s going to be trouble. When a trio of young guys knock at the door – their car has broken down – Maggie sees her chance to escape. Harold puts on a show of good-old-fashioned hospitality for their guests, but pretty soon reveals his endless store of wrath for anyone who has strayed from the path of righteousness. Davison plays Harold a bit too genially: there is a likable Jeff Bridges energy to his performance, and not an awful lot of fire in his rants and violent rampaging. In fact, though the movie is played straight, it’s not remotely scary; there might have been more mileage in chucking in a few gags and turning the material into a black comedy spoof. • We Still Say Grace is released on 3 May on digital platforms.",We Still Say Grace,FILM
"337 ","Lucky review – spirited Ghanaian romcom captures the social media age                         ","Here is a vibrant, idiosyncratic portrait of Ghanaian youth, bursting with wisecracks and a boyish restlessness. There is an amateurish shakiness to the visuals, but the film overcomes this with a lot of charm and an innate understanding of its young subjects. University student Lucky (Kumi Obuoabisa) is a loafer who perpetually borrows money from his hardworking mother and enjoys a minor kind of social media fame. His screen – and the film’s screen – lights up with notifications every minute. To his surprise, he secures a date with gorgeous online “it girl” Nuttifafa (Jane Efya Awindor) but with no money to his name, Lucky calls on his friend Wadaada (Solomon Fixon-Owoo Jr), a hustler who prides himself on being able to sell anything. Together the pair try to unload a MacBook laptop, a seemingly uncomplicated task that entangles them with dangerous criminals. These days, films about youth and social media are a dime a dozen but very few of them understand how young people actually talk on such platforms. The strength of Lucky is that it captures perfectly the banality of someone sliding into your DMs and is laugh-out-loud funny in its relatability. In a supporting part, Fixon-Owoo proves to be the real star. Wadaada’s various hustling schemes are amusing, but the character’s frustration with his conservative father lends a real depth to what could have been a caricature. The laddish attitude of Lucky’s leads is jarring and at times uncomfortable; in their world, women seem to be either a nuisance or a prize. Perhaps such portraits are an indictment of young male behaviour in this age of fast-food romance. But given that the scenes are often played for laughs, Lucky crosses the dangerously thin line between satire and simple sexism. Lucky is released on 10 May on digital platforms.",Lucky,FILM
"338 ","Atlantis review – strangely upbeat exploration of war-ravaged Ukraine                         ","Ukrainian writer-director Valentyn Vasyanovych’s drama won the top prize in the Horizons strand at the Venice film festival in 2019: in the signature style of Slavic arthouse cinema, it mostly comprises a series of long-held, static widescreen tableaux. Each scene is about the same length, and within each long, ventilator-speed shot everything seems to carry the same weight: a man being berated by a supervisor at a steel mill and then jumping into the smelter in despair; another guy making a bathtub out of a rusted out digger bucket; a couple having sex in real time. The story is set in 2025, “a year after the end of the war” – in other words the one with Russia in eastern Ukraine that’s been rumbling away for years now. But instead of being numbingly dreary and depressing, given the economically depressed, horrifically polluted and landmine-strewn region, Atlantis is strangely upbeat, oddly hopeful even. It helps that Vasyanovych, who was also the cinematographer and editor of The Tribe, an outstanding Ukrainian film from 2014, has cast deeply likable and empathic non-professionals, most of whom reportedly had direct experience of the conflict. They reward the director with fine performances. Lushly bearded Serghiy (Andriy Rymaruk) has a gentle, bearish mien and is entirely convincing as a former soldier and former steelworker, who ends up helping former archaeology student and ex-paramedic Katya in the ongoing project of retrieving the anonymous remains of the dead from the fields of battle so that forensic specialists can try to identify the bodies. (She notes with bitter irony that she’s ended up working in the field she studied, only now she’s digging up bodies much less ancient than she expected.) Compared with other recent features set around this region, like Sergey Loznitsa’s antic, surrealist satire Donbass, Atlantis is more conventional and more accessible. But at least it gets to outline some of the horrors of what’s going on there, in a war almost entirely out of sight and mind for viewers in most of the west, and it does so without leaving any acrid taste of hopelessness. • This review was amended on 20 May 2021. The bath was made out of a digger bucket, not a car as stated in an earlier version. • Atlantis is available on 4 May on Mubi.",Atlantis,FILM
"339 ","In Short, Europe: Happy Together review – a union uplifted by humour","In the wake of Brexit, there’s a defiant note in the overarching theme – Happy Together – of this year’s survey of European shorts, brought to us by EUNIC London, an umbrella organisation for EU cultural institutions, and pulled together by London-based curator Shira MacLeod. But, as they say, it’s complicated: the “happiness”, as flaunted in many of these 19 short films, feels somewhat ironic; long-suffering humour the common currency in muddling through a bundle of dissatisfactions, gripes and misunderstandings. In Barnabás Tóth’s Chuchotage, two Hungarian translators make unlikely sweet talk from the Euro-sustainability waffle they have to parse for an attractive client. The scenario walks a fine line next to creepy sexual harassment – before these cunning linguists get their comeuppance. Personal lives thrashing tragicomically in the shadow of the political has been a hallmark of the Romanian new wave, and The Christmas Gift’s hilarious premise suggests director Bogdan Mureşanu could be another future star of that movement. After overhearing his dad badmouth Ceauşescu, a seven-year-old posts a letter to Santa saying his parent’s present should be for “uncle Nick” to die. “He’s no child, we’ve raised a snitch,” yells the panicked father. Meanwhile, Swimmer is a Mexican – or rather Swedish – standoff in a municipal pool as two policemen’s attempt to extract a lawbreaker wrings deadpan magic from piped Muzak, as director Jonatan Etzler floats a cheeky meditation on the boundaries between public and private space. There are more solemn entries: Vanessa Del Campo’s Mars, Oman, shot with photojournalistic rigour, fruitfully collages Bedouin, trainee astronauts and aspiring Arab scientists, while a golden-haired youth freewheels through gentrifying Porto in Leonor Teles’s Dogs Barking at Birds, done with Claire Denis-like suppleness. But the two standouts choose to play things light: the candy-coloured Czech animation Sh_t Happens, by Michaela Mihályi and Dávid Štumpf, is a three-part hard-luck story about a janitor in a building full of animal tenants, which has a Robert Crumb-esque feistiness and punchy sound design. And the hills are alive with hollers, trills and whoops in Hannes Lang’s RIAFN, an initially quaint montage of Tyrolean shepherds’ calls that builds into something as pure and invigorating as a mountain stream. At this altitude, European humour has left daily worries far below. • In Short, Europe is available 7-16 May on digital platforms.","In Short, Europe: Happy Together",FILM
"340 ","End of Sentence review – a masterclass in understated acting                                  ","John Hawkes is one of those actors with a lived-in quality that pulls viewers in before a single line of dialogue is even spoken, and End of a Sentence is yet another testament to the stunning ease with which he slips into his roles. A healing road trip that takes the audience from Alabama to the winding roads of Ireland, Elfar Adalsteins’ directorial debut captures well-trodden paths with fresh eyes. Frank (Hawkes) is a mild-mannered man with a severe exactness to his gestures, the polar opposite of his volatile and impulsive son Sean (Logan Lerman), who has just got out of prison after doing time for car theft. As Frank’s wife has died, the estranged pair are forced to squeeze into a plane, and then a car, as they fulfil her dying wish to have her ashes scattered at a lake in Ireland. Along the way, they pick up Jewel (Sarah Bolger), a hitchhiker with a troubled past, all while attempting to exorcise their shared demons. End of a Sentence is a reminder of how pleasurable it is to see genuinely pitch-perfect acting, the kind that quietly brings characters’ inner lives to the fore. The father-son relationship feels beautifully real, due in part to the precise, economical writing but also to the effortless chemistry between Hawkes and Lerman. Despite her brief screen time, Bolger is arresting and memorable, no easy feat considering that her character feels like a plot device. This writing, along with the occasional on-the-nose song choice and heavy-handed colour correction, lets down a film that is at its best when the camera takes a step back and simply allows the action to unfold.

"341 ","Golden Globes body unveils plans to deal with crisis over diversity and ethics                ","The Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), the body that organises the Golden Globe awards, has outlined the changes it plans to make in an attempt to rescue its credibility after months of complaints and criticism over the lack of diversity in its membership and “ethical lapses” in the way it conducted its business. In a letter to the organisation’s membership published by Deadline, the HFPA said that it has “created a roadmap for transformational change in our organisation”. The plan calls for the HFPA (which currently has about 90 members) to add a minimum of 20 new members in 2021 “with a specific focus on recruiting Black members”, and over the next 18 months to expand to more than 130, as well as changing many of the requirements (such as residence in southern California) which it claims are “barriers” to “underrepresented groups”. The HFPA also says it will “develop a comprehensive and long-term strategy for the recruitment of racially diverse journalists”. The organisation also addresses criticisms over its perceived ethical issues, after claims that awards voting has been influenced by promotional handouts, members receiving disproportionate financial rewards, and claims of unprofessional behaviour in press conferences. The plan calls for an end to members taking “promotional items”, a “review of press conference procedures” and to “strengthen conflict of interest disclosures”. The HFPA board is threatening to resign en masse if the current membership fails to approve its plans. A positive reception for the HFPA’s proposals from the film and TV industry is vital for the continued existence of its lucrative Golden Globe awards. NBC, the TV network that pays around $60m per year to show the Globes, called it “an encouraging step in the right direction” in a statement to Deadline. It added: “The organisation’s swift adoption and meaningful execution of the plan in its entirety are essential for the Golden Globes to remain on NBC.” However, recent crises show that the HFPA is far from out of the woods. It was forced to expel its former president Philip Berk after he shared an anti-Black Lives Matter article from a far-right website that described the movement as a “racist hate group”; while two of its key hires – diversity and inclusion adviser Shaun Harper and crisis management consultant Judy Smith – departed from their roles. The organisation is also facing a boycott by influential Hollywood PR firms, as well as vocal criticism from the Time’s Up campaign group.",Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA),OTHERS
"342 ","Betrayed review – restrained depiction of Norway’s Holocaust victims                          ","Steven Spielberg once said of Schindler’s List that he was telling a story of the Holocaust, not the story. “There are millions of stories of the Shoah. Six million of them we’ll never hear.” In this heartfelt, restrained movie, Norwegian film-maker Eirik Svensson dramatises the true story of one family of victims from Nazi-occupied Norway. In November 1942, large numbers of Norwegian Jews were rounded up in the middle of the night and taken to a dock in Oslo; 529 were loaded on to a German cargo ship, the SS Donau, and deported to Auschwitz. Jakob Oftebro plays Charles Braude, a good-natured and thoroughly decent young boxing champion who lives in Oslo with his parents and grown-up siblings, all six of them crammed into a two-bedroom apartment. The film begins at the very start of the war, taking great care to paint the Braudes as a close-knit, happy family; it is a little idealised perhaps, but knowing what is to come, incredibly emotional. The Braudes don’t believe the war can touch them in neutral Norway. Then the Germans invade; Charles is arrested and sent to an internment camp with his father and brothers. A Norwegian soldier in the camp, a man with a toad-like smile who makes a big show of being one of the good guys, challenges him to a boxing match, putting Charles in a terrible dilemma – it’s impossible to say no, but to survive he cannot draw attention to himself. The title is an accusation against Norwegians who collaborated with the Nazis; and Betrayed is also at pains to show how some ordinary Norwegians were indifferent to the fate of their Jewish neighbours. It’s a film of desperately upsetting details. Near the end, after the Donau has set sail, large bins full of ID cards stamped with a red “J” are left behind at the dock – no longer needed. And yet there is nothing here that’s too disturbing, no humiliation that’s unwatchably harrowing. It left me wondering what room there is for understatement in a film about the Holocaust, or whether at some point restraint diminishes the true horror. • Betrayed is released on 10 May on digital platforms.",Betrayed,FILM
"343 ","Little Fish review – all-too-brief encounter in the midst of amnesia pandemic                 ","Once you get past its note of emo-mawkishness, there’s something disquieting and poignant (and rather prescient) about this doomed love story of the future, from director Chad Hartigan and taken from a short story by Los Angeles author Aja Gabel. Emma (Olivia Cooke) and Jude (Jack O’Connell) are a young couple living in an America ravaged by a pandemic causing memory loss. The disease has been causing planes to crash, because pilots suddenly forget how to fly, and marathon competitors to keep on running into the night because they’ve forgotten they’re supposed to stop. The couple’s best friends have been hit by the disease, and Emma and Jude are now themselves anxiously monitoring each other for the first signs of forgetfulness, and trying to hoard their romantic memories (so recently made) against the great forthcoming oblivion. Little Fish has obvious echoes of Alfonso Cuarón’s Children of Men and Christopher Nolan’s Memento, though its purpose is to brood more statically on the nature of memory and love. Sometimes it tries the patience, just a little. But it’s a film that is in tune with the Covid age, and it plugs in to one of the great contemporary issues: dementia. The spectacle of young people suffering memory loss is a bold narrative strategy whose effect is to remind you that the old are not a separate, lesser tribe who somehow don’t deserve to avoid dementia: everyone is equal, young and old, and old people feel the agony of dementia as much as young people would (and sometimes do, in early-onset cases). O’Connell – a very good actor of whom I feel I haven’t seen enough recently – is tender and sympathetic as Jude, and Cooke is similarly intelligent and gentle as Emma. • Little Fish is released on 10 May on digital platforms.",Little Fish,FILM
"344 ","Blacks Can’t Swim: The Sequel review – follow-up doc makes a splash                           ","In this feature-length extension of his 2020 documentary A Film Called Blacks Can’t Swim, producer and writer Ed Accura devotes further time pondering the titular myth. It’s immediately clear that it’s a case of don’t, not can’t. But however it has come about, this shibboleth is now responsible for an astonishing statistic: 95% of black adults in the UK and 80% of black children do not swim. As the film points out multiple times, this has life-threatening implications. Lack of parental encouragement, lack of opportunities at school, no role models, braided hair, fear of the deep end and ancestral memories of slave-trade Atlantic drownings are just some of the reasons given in a generous spread of interviews. As well as this fieldwork, the film also has an activist thread in order to combat what Accura calls “blaquaphobia”: dramatised interludes in which he plays Frank, a recent swimming convert trying to convince a pair of reluctant teenagers, K Frost (Reginald Mudenda) and Layla (Amina Smith-Gul), to take part in a gala as part of a programme for disadvantaged young people. The character is based on Accura’s own journey of learning to swim as a 53-year-old. These segments are a little clunky, but hook you in teen-mag photo-story style. K Frost getting suddenly enthusiastic about hitting the leisure centre when Frank bribes them with a meet with a music-video director is particularly amusing. The film’s length and occasional repetitiveness risks the attention-span equivalent of wrinkly fingers, and perhaps breaking out some historical perspective could have been illuminating: recent US research suggests that antebellum African Americans did swim more frequently, and the current stereotypes stem from the rise of white-dominated beach and pool culture. But Accura’s good-humoured approach is a fine ice-breaker for the subject. As one interviewee points out, maybe all black UK swimming needs now is one major cultural advocate.

"345 ","Fried Barry review – alien’s scuzzy body-horror odyssey in Cape Town                          ","This gleefully lurid, picaresque journey through a few days in Cape Town for an alien inhabiting the body of a skeevy junkie named Barry (Gary Green) won’t be everyone’s cup of tea. But scattered among the gross-out scenes – involving violence or bodily fluids or both, the bouts of softcore shagging, and innumerable garish “trippy” bits where the protagonist and his acquaintances do drugs – there’s actually some reasonably sharply comic, surprisingly touching and straight-up well-acted moments. Presumably, the key variables are the improvising performers that first-time director Ryan Kruger, fluffing up what was originally a short into feature length, collaborated with for each scene. Some, like Chanelle de Jager, who plays Barry’s longsuffering wife and is given to long profane rants in Afrikaans about Barry’s uselessness, have real acting chops and bring a palpable humanity to the absurdist setup. Similarly, Sean Cameron Michael and Joe Vaz as psychiatric hospital patients display great comic timing in their bit, and Jonathan Pienaar makes for a terrifyingly sadistic psychopath who performs impromptu dentistry on Barry. Lead actor Green, despite the fact that he apparently worked mostly as a stuntman and had non-speaking roles before this, also has a magnetic screen presence, even though he’s not exactly pretty enough to explain why every woman he meets wants to have sex with him. His improvisational skills are on the same par as the others, but that works just fine given he’s meant to be a broer from another planet. The film’s main failing is that it doesn’t seem to have very much to say about the society in which it’s set. Compared to other Candide-like satires, like O Lucky Man!, Lindsay Anderson’s rollicking adventure through early 1970s Britain, or Rolf de Heer’s marvellously bonkers Bad Boy Bubby from 1993, which romped through another southern hemisphere city in the shape of Adelaide, Fried Barry feels much more like a shaggy dog story without a point: random and meaningless.

"346 ","Steven Soderbergh: Oscars ending changed in case Chadwick Boseman won                         ","Steven Soderbergh, the film-maker who co-produced this year’s Oscars ceremony, has defended the controversial decision to switch round the running order, meaning the final prizes were best actress and best actor, with best film coming third from the end. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Soderbergh credited the decision to the likely narrative of the night, saying that he and fellow producers Stacey Sher and Jesse Collins first discussed the possibility back in January, months before the nominations. “It’s our belief – that I think is not unfounded – that actors’ speeches tend to be more dramatic than producers’ speeches,” said Soderbergh. Back in January, a win for the late actor Chadwick Boseman for his role in Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom also seemed almost certain, with his widow accepting the award on his behalf. This eventuality, said Soderbergh, “would have been such a shattering moment” that “to come back after that would have been just impossible”. Therefore, continued Soderbergh, switching the categories around seemed sensible. “I said if there was even the sliver of a chance that he would win and that his widow would speak, then we were operating under the fact that was the end of the show,” he said. In fact, Boseman lost out on the best actor prize to Anthony Hopkins for his performance in The Father. Hopkins, 83, was in Wales at the time of the ceremony and did not travel to the London hub to pick up his award – at what would have been nearly 4am local time – as the producers had requested. Hopkins’ co-star Olivia Colman, who did attend the London ceremony, was also not allowed to receive it on his behalf. The actor offered to join the ceremony via video link, but the Oscar producers stood firm on their “no Zoom” policy, meaning the show closed abruptly with best actor presenter Joaquin Phoenix accepting the prize for Hopkins and credits quickly rolling. The lack of closure was exacerbated by the lack of a host to wind proceedings up. Asked if he regretted the decision not to allow Hopkins to join by video link, Soderbergh said: “No.” The TV ratings for this year’s Oscars were 58% down on last year.",Steven Soderbergh,FILM-CREW
"347 ","Cowboys review – Steve Zahn brings his A-game to warm Montana trans drama                     ","There’s a marvellous gentleness and warmth to this Montana-set drama from writer-director Anna Kerrigan. Its star, Steve Zahn, has been a mainstay of Hollywood-indie character acting these 30 years, and he brings his A-game to playing Troy, a roguish, big-hearted guy with a drinking problem, a bipolar disorder and a prison record. He was once married to Sally, played by Jillian Bell, and on the weekends, despite the lack of any court order enforcing it, Sally still lets him see their 10-year-old who absolutely adores him and hates the girly dresses and dolls that Sally keeps supplying and loves instead the Stetsons, denims and huge belt buckles that Troy has. Troy chuckles indulgently at these “tomboy” mannerisms, which triggers this outburst: “Tomboys are just another type of girl – and I’m not a girl.” Their child is not their daughter but rather their transgender son – whose name should be Joe, not the “Josie” they’ve been using. Troy grasps this but Sally can’t, and it’s an outstanding performance from child actor Sasha Knight. This family dynamic comes to a crisis as the fragile relationship between Troy and Sally further disintegrates and, in an increasingly emotional state, Troy effectively kidnaps Joe for a camping trip that, in his muddled, feverish mind, will be their escape up north to Canada, just two cowboys together. For all his problems and inadequacies, Troy – the outsider, the transgressor – is the one who understands Joe, but Bell shows how Sally is understandably angry at how Troy gets to swagger around as the freewheeling male hero and role model while she is gender-stereotyped as the woman landed with the unglamorous job of caregiving. “Look who gets to suck,” she says, asking angrily: “Who would choose to be a girl?” And there is the further issue of how cowboys idolise and fetishise their phallic guns, which are going to get Troy and Joe into deep trouble. Cowboys is a film that relaxes into its ideas and themes, and the performances from Knight, Zahn and Bell – with Ann Dowd as the cop on Troy’s trail – are all tremendous. • Cowboys is released on 7 May on digital platforms.",Cowboys,FILM

As head of the London Film Commission (now Film London) she played a major part in making London a film-friendly city. Sue’s forte was making things happen. She was born in London, the eldest child and only daughter of James Hayes, who worked at the Vauxhall car plant at Luton, and his wife, Alice (nee Manuel). She attended Apsley grammar school, Hemel Hempstead, and studied economics and sociology at City University (now City, University of London), graduating in the late 1970s. She took a diploma in industrial relations and politics from the LSE, and went into journalism, working variously for the Daily Mirror, Der Spiegel and the Sunday Times (where we met), as well as working as a researcher for Granada TV and freelancing for Thames Television, London Weekend, and ITN. From 1979 to 1983 she was director of the Edinburgh International TV festival. In 1989 Sue launched her own independent production company, VPL, which made TV documentaries, including For the Sake of the Children (1991), which won an International Emmy. It was the story of a remarkable Manchester woman, Anita Goulden, who visited Peru and decided to stay and care for orphaned children. As a result of the film, a charity was established.

"349 ","Citizen Penn review – Hollywood star’s vanity project lifts Haiti                             ","Actor, director, screenwriter and now novelist Sean Penn has had some mixed notices for his non-showbiz activities and his dramatic interventions in various international situations – including his defiant declaration of faith in the late Hugo Chávez and his successor as Venezuelan president, the now-notorious Nicolás Maduro. And the naysayers and the eye-rollers may not be entirely mollified by this documentary about Sean Penn’s charity work in Haiti, which does come across in some ways as a 93-minute self-administered high-five. It begins with a carefully curated montage of TV news footage tacitly admitting what a paparazzo-punching brat he once was – but there is no clip of his puppet appearance in Trey Parker and Matt Stone’s comedy Team America: World Police as an archetypal whiny liberal. Well, Sean Penn is entitled to praise. In 2010, he responded to the news about the Haiti earthquake by mobilising contacts already amassed during his experience helping out during Hurricane Katrina, and he got on to Chávez, and asked him to supply hundreds of thousands of vials of Venezuelan morphine for Haiti’s field hospitals. (Penn had been out to Venezuela to meet Chávez the year before in the sceptical company of Christopher Hitchens, who had called him an “oil-rich clown”.) Penn then buccaneeringly headed out to Haiti and virtually commanded his own emergency relief programme, with the aid of the US military and with donations that he was able to secure through self-publicising TV interviews with CNN’s Anderson Cooper. The resulting aid body continued to grow over the next decade, with the aid of Penn’s Geldofian annual fundraising dinners, inevitably featuring concerts by U2; it evolved into a new organisation that trains emergency first-responders in the US and the Caribbean, and also helped with America’s Covid vaccination rollout, a new twist which the movie was able to edit into the closing credits. What the film shows – perhaps not entirely intentionally – is that maybe you need someone vain enough to think he is destined to make a difference, and cunning enough to see how the vanity-economy of movie celebrity can generate media attention and cash. And Penn’s involvement has been a lasting thing. Perhaps the film could have benefited from a more analytical discussion of Haiti’s larger historical context, but it’s a worthwhile record. • Citizen Penn is released on 6 May on Discovery+.",Citizen Penn,FILM

Her mom ran out a year earlier (“The river stink drove her crazy”), leaving Margo and her Native American dad Bernard (Tatanka Means). And here the voiceover ends, slightly frustratingly, since Margo rarely speaks, and this is the only time that we get much of a hint of her inner life. She spends her days fishing in the river and hunting deer; she’s a brilliant shot, much better than the boys. But she is also prey. Her cousin eyes her with a feral leer, though in the end it’s her dad’s white half-brother, uncle Cal (Coburn Goss), who lures her into the toolshed. What happens next is not a rape; Rose’s script is insistent throughout that Margo is a survivor not a victim, at the expense perhaps of giving her much in the way of human feelings. There’s a blankness to her character that’s hard to get beyond. The incident in the shed leads to a death. Rifle in hand, Margo takes off in her boat – the River Rose – to find her mother. On the way she relies on the kindness of strangers. There’s a borderline creepy guy who her dad sells deer meat to, a young academic who is impressed by Margo’s survival skills, and, best of all, an emphysemic old-timer called Smoke (John Ashton). For an odyssey about a young woman making her own way in the world, it’s a bit disappointing that all the people who help Margo are men. • Once Upon a River is released on 7 May on digital platforms.",Once Upon a River,FILM
"351 ","Charlatan review – inside the mind of a prickly mystic                                        ","A local legend in the mid-20th century Czech Republic who scrutinised the urine of his clients and made diagnoses based on a blend of science and mysticism, Jan Mikolášek is a prickly subject for Agnieszka Holland’s latest biographical drama. Its title notwithstanding, the film expends little energy exploring whether or not Mikolášek’s healing gift was genuine. The recurring shots of him glowering at his own hands suggest that it was real, and as much a curse as a blessing. But Mikolášek (Ivan Trojan) does double duty as a character. Not only is he a conflicted man – impatient, impossibly demanding in his work and in his covert gay relationship with his assistant, Frantisek (Juraj Loj) – he also symbolises postwar eastern Europe, torn between political allegiances, progress and superstition, science and folklore. There’s an austere elegance to Holland’s film-making, particularly in the frames within frames that box the permanently peevish Mikolášek into places he would prefer not to be, next to sick people he would prefer not to have to care for. But like the character it explores, Charlatan can seem rather dour at times. A more playful director might have let the amber hues of the ubiquitous pee samples seep into the colour palette, but Holland takes her cues from the greyish complexions of the ailing and the sticky blacks and greens of a gangrenous leg.

"352 ","Cowboys review – progressive, predictable Montana trans tale","Comic actors Steve Zahn and Jillian Bell are uncharacteristically earnest in this achingly well-intentioned but thuddingly heavy-handed family drama. Zahn plays Troy, the heavily medicated but supportive father of a trans boy, Joe (Sasha Knight, impressive). Bell is Sally, Joe’s mother, who forces Barbies and pink on to her mortified child. In the war zone of Troy and Sally’s relationship, pronouns are wielded like weapons. Even before the repeated shots of Troy chucking back mood stabilisers by the fistful, the unsanctioned father-son road trip into the Montana wilderness seems like a really bad idea. Then Troy loses his tablets and the cops, led by a firm but fair Ann Dowd, close in on the boy and his increasingly erratic father. Plenty of child-with-gun foreshadowing leaves little doubt about how the third act will play out. On Curzon Home Cinema and digital download",Cowboys,FILM
"353 ","Once Upon a River review – a meandering story of survival                                     ","A survival story in which a teenage girl, severed by tragedy from her home, goes in search of her estranged mother, Haroula Rose’s debut feature Once Upon a River has a superficial kinship with Debra Granik’s Winter’s Bone. But rather than the sinewy toughness of that picture, this adaptation of the novel by Bonnie Jo Campbell is meandering in its pacing, losing power rather than building it as the story unfolds. Apart from the atmospheric wetland backdrop, the film’s main asset is Kenadi DelaCerna, self-possessed and soulful in the role of the part Native American 15-year-old, Margo Crane.

"354 ","Servants review – evil permeates a Catholic seminary                                          ","As if in a succession of scenes from a starkly remembered bad dream, this deeply disturbing film in haunting monochrome, from director Ivan Ostrochovský and co-writers Rebecca Lenkiewicz and Marek Lescák, tells the story of two students in a Catholic seminary in early-80s Czechoslovakia, part of the (real life) Pacem in Terris organisation, a collaborationist body through which the church submitted to state control in return for the right to (notional) existence. Juraj (Samuel Skyva) and Michal (Samuel Polakovič) are fresh-faced boys who arrive at the seminary to find themselves in an austere haunted house of shame, reeking of paranoia, exhaustion and self-reproach. Dissident young priests are secretly communicating with the Vatican and with Radio Free Europe and the priestly authorities have neither the courage to endorse this defiance nor the ruthlessness to suppress it, and so the secret police are making their malign presence felt – in the form of “Dr Ivan”, who has a blackmailing hold on one of the senior clerics. He is a deeply malevolent man with a skin disorder, played by Vlad Ivanov, another in this actor’s gallery of odious east European authority figures. There are some amazing visual compositions, chiefly some repeated overhead shots of a central basement-level courtyard, accessible via a flight of stone steps, in which washing is hung up and whispered plotting takes place: it is a rectangle of strangeness, like an Escher drawing. And all the time the security police are getting ready to remove undesirable persons, perhaps through the fiction of a military “draft” or through simple murder. Pure evil permeates this brief, 80-minute film, whose cold visual brilliance reminds me of the recent movies of Paweł Pawlikowski. It wasn’t until some time after it had finished that I grasped one of the reasons it was so oppressive: there are no women in it at all. There is a chill of political fear. • Servants is released on 14 May on digital platforms.",Servants,FILM
"355 ","A Space in Time review – lyrical portrait of a family facing an incurable disorder            ","Here is a deeply personal documentary that raises awareness about a disability without neglecting the interiority of those living with the condition. Co-directed by Riccardo Servini and Nick Taussig, the film follows the Taussig family’s experience of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a genetic disorder that affects their young sons, Theo and Oscar. Duchenne is incurable and fatal. By the time Theo and Oscar are in their teens, they will be using wheelchairs full time; their 20s will come with ventilators. Throughout the film, Taussig gently explains these realities to his sons, with no sugarcoating. Satisfying children’s curiosity has never been easy, and here the task is made even more difficult when science itself has yet to provide all answers. The recurring juxtaposition of these conversations with Theo and Oscar playing in the garden or getting dressed for school captures how the condition, while debilitating, is also just one facet of their lives. At one point, the inquisitive Theo asks if ice cream can cure Duchenne. The boys’ experiences are rendered acutely intimate, normalised and without hollow pity. The film also places a poignant emphasis on community and accessibility. Thanks to the goodwill of a building company, the Taussigs’ house is designed to meet the needs of their sons, including wide hallways to provide easy access for their wheelchairs. Interviews with people at different stages of Duchenne and their families illuminate how the condition progresses and also highlight the solidarity among them. Moments of darkness recur throughout the film, the final shot of the Taussigs sitting and laughing on a swing says it all. The future will always be shifting and uncertain, but they, and their community, are all in this together. • A Space in Time is released on 17 May on digital platforms.",A Space in Time,FILM
"356 ","Objector review – Israeli anti-occupation documentary wears its politics on its sleeve        ","In this rousing, unabashedly left-inflected documentary, we meet Atalya Ben Abba, a young Israeli woman staring down the barrel of the mandatory military service everyone in the country must do when they come of age. But Atalya doesn’t want to play any part in the state apparatus that makes the occupation of Palestine possible. Instead, she proclaims herself a conscientious objector, and must face time in prison. While her brother Amitai gets where she’s coming from, others in her family – her mother Alona, sister, father, grandparents – find it harder to understand Atalya’s point of view, especially the members of the older generation who grew up in the shadow of the Holocaust. On the other hand, footage here proves that Zionist extremism permeates every generation: frothy-mouthed young Israeli rightwingers show up at the demonstrations where Atalya speaks only to counterprotest and demand that Atalya and other objectors “go back to Berlin”. Still, Atalya’s story and the testimony of some of her fellow objectors who hope for a political and diplomatic solution to the conflict suggests that the younger generation’s attitudes may be shifting, even if Atalya’s nephew learns about joining the army as early at the first grade. Director Molly Stuart includes interview footage with displaced Palestinians as well as pro-settlement Israelis in order to strike some semblance of balance. But the surging score over montages of Atalya protesting, and others demonstrating their support for her while she’s in military prison makes it pretty clear where our sympathies ought to lie. Strategies like that are legitimate for the purposes of persuasive film-making, but I intensely distrust the use of staged re-enactments in documentaries, like the one in which Atalya argues her case before the Israel Defense Forces’ conscience committee hearing. Even if it’s supposed to be based on a transcript, it just feels disingenuous. • Objector is released on 14 May on True Story.",Objector,FILM
"357 ","Born in Flames review – subversive spirit of 80s agitprop lives on                            ","Here is the 1983 zero-budget underground movie from radical feminist director Lizzie Borden (who was born Linda Borden and took the name of the famous “40 whacks” woman) now on rerelease after a recent restoration. One factor that may have kept this film long under the radar is its quite extraordinary climax in which a revolutionary bomb blows up one of New York’s World Trade Center towers – a low-budget but remarkably potent and dreamlike special effect just before the closing credits. And the scene in which this bomb is planted, with someone making her way up to the top floor, creeping through a service door and leaving a suspicious suitcase in a dark empty area full of wires, shows every sign of guerrilla-filming without permission in the place itself. The setting is an alternative-reality New York of the present day (which is to say, the early 80s), 10 years after a peaceful revolution has supposedly introduced a socialist state. But the resulting government, dominated by a single party with frowningly earnest male apparatchiks supervising “workfare” schemes and officially approved feminist theoretical journals, is indistinguishable in its conformism from Reagan’s America; Borden is filming on the real New York streets, also using real news footage of real demos and real police violence. The premise is a rather elegant and sophisticated joke and Born in Flames is comparable to Peter Watkins’s Punishment Park or Godard’s Alphaville. The star is nonprofessional Jeanne Satterfield, a former high-school basketball star who, after this film, became a drug counsellor. She plays Adelaide, a radical “Women’s Army” activist, reclaiming the streets from rapists and the state from patriarchy; she is at odds with the kowtowing collaborationist feminist journalists, two of whom are played by film-maker Pat Murphy (whose feature Maeve is incidentally also rereleased this week) and a young Kathryn Bigelow. Adelaide is mentored by veteran radical Zella Wylie, played by the civil rights advocate Florynce Kennedy. The action culminates in an armed raid on a TV news station, and a young Eric Bogosian plays one of the flabbergasted directors held at gunpoint. The anarchic spirit of agitprop pulses from this scrappy, smart, subversive film. Borden went on to make Working Girls – about sex work – which is also being prepared for rerelease. • Born in Flames is released on 12 May on Mubi.",Born in Flames,FILM
"358 ","Undergods review – a visionary dystopian anthology                                            ","A riptide of surrealism runs through Chino Moya’s ambitious debut feature, a fantasy suite of tales that don’t so much interlock as butt into one another and blurt out alarming, dreamlike correspondences. Undergods begins with a prologue set in a filthy, post-apocalyptic landscape of Soviet-style tower blocks, being scavenged by Z (Géza Röhrig) and K (Johann Myers). After dumping another corpse in the back of their truck, K confesses to a recurring dream about a pale-faced man – a “ghost” – haunting an empty apartment, “somewhere far, far away from this dump”. This is Ron (Michael Gould), protagonist of the next story, and apparently the only tenant in a high-spec development in the last stages of completion – could it be one of the post-apocalyptic blocks in better days? He and his wife Ruth (Hayley Carmichael) are surprised when a shifty stranger (Ned Dennehy) turns up at their door claiming to have locked himself out of the 11th floor. Ill-advisedly, they make him up a bed. Next stop, with narration by a latecomer in the condo story, is an unspecified mittel-European metropolis where greedy bigwig Hans (Eric Godon) swindles a wild-haired inventor (with a nod to ETA Hoffman’s The Sandman) and pays the price. All these characters are propelled along on surges of Vangelis-like synth, and it is as if the Spanish-born, UK-based Moya is pointing the way – with the ennui and selfish impulses on show in the sub-stories, and the totalitarian-tinged framing narrative – towards some dark, unifying destiny. The last story echoes the first. Rachel (Kate Dickie) and Dominic (Adrian Rawlins) find themselves in an awkward ménage à trois when her ex-husband, whom she prefers, returns from the post-apocalyptic realm after 15 years. Orbiting around dysfunctional domesticity and satirical business environments, Moya has a weakness for parody that sometimes bogs the film down and is in tension with a surrealist wanderlust on the hunt for more startling epiphanies. But the grand visuals – almost constructivist at points – serve both purposes very well, and you’ve got to be heartened by the film’s commitment to originality. • Undergods is released on 17 May in cinemas and on digital platforms.",Undergods,FILM
"359 ","The Lady in the Portrait review – painterly pageantry in a Chinese royal court                ","This French-Chinese co-production about an earlier French-Chinese collaboration offers handsome pageantry amid its lavish recreation of 18th-century imperial court life, but it isn’t quite enough to compensate for a puttering narrative motor. Longtime Apichatpong Weerasethakul producer Charles de Meaux has turned director with a far eastern equivalent of Girl With a Pearl Earring – another decorous, ever so slightly sleepy matinee sit. The film’s subject is Jean-Denis Attiret (played by Melvil Poupaud), a real-life French Jesuit missionary who spent half of his 60-odd years employed as the Chinese court painter. His trickiest commission, recalled here, came from the emperor’s bored wife (Fan Bingbing), thirsting to preserve an image that might turn her indifferent husband’s head. Most of the action, such as it is, takes place in Attiret’s makeshift studio, where the central relationship progresses as the painter shifts from tentative charcoal sketches to making marks with ink and acrylic, while various hangers-on debate the differences between Chinese and European art. De Meaux also permits himself the odd expressionistic flourish. A prologue superimposes one of Attiret’s canvasses on an empty battlefield, doubtless saving the director money on armour-clad extras, while his model drifts away to have conversations with the spectres of previous empresses – a very Weerasethakul-like touch, intended to draw out the inner life of a quiet, demure figure. Elsewhere, De Meaux holds dear to the virtues of classical painting. Serving as his own cinematographer, he dabs thoughtful widescreen compositions with appealing pastel hues, aware that – in the drama’s quieter moments – he can always fall back on the ever-absorbing sight of an artist’s hands at work. There are a lot of those moments, though, part of a curious void at the heart of the film, as if the characters were the last elements sketched in, and then in haste. I wondered whether De Meaux’s art-history nous might be better turned to production design or even curation: as it is, the vases adorning the sets demonstrate more character and depth than his pretty yet passive leads. Undeniably artful – but a lot of that beauty is on the inert side. •The Lady in the Portrait is in cinemas on 17 May.",The Lady in the Portrait,FILM
"360 ","The Swordsman review – thrilling fight scenes in spectacular Korean action drama              ","The Swordsman, a pacy, crisply choreographed South Korean action film set in the 17th century handicaps itself by opting for such a bland, generic title. It’s like naming a Hollywood action movie The Gunman or The Cop. Debutant writer-director Choi Jae-Hoon could have been a little more specific about the protagonist Tae-yul (played by boy-band-beautiful star and sometime rapper Jang Hyuk) by calling it The Blind Swordsman, given the character’s vision impairment. But then that title has already been used several times. Also, Tae-yul is not quite blind yet, although the threat to his vision and his need to access an expensive medicine hang over the plot throughout. As it happens, the intricate tapestry of action, family drama, political intrigue and period spectacle is anything but generic. Unfolding during a period when ruling dynasties in China and Korea were in major flux, the story springboards off the fall of the Joseon dynasty’s 15th king; a disgrace in combat sends Tae-yul, one of the finest swordsmen in the country, into exile with his baby daughter. Several years later, Tae-yul is living in rural isolation up a mountain; his daughter Tae-ok (Kim Hyun-soo) is now a young woman who longs for the finer things in life. The pair venture into society in search of a cure for his worsening eyesight, only to find that invaders from China’s Qing clan, led by Gurutai (Indonesian actor Joe Taslim, all the more menacing for never speaking above a whisper) are raiding the country, carrying away women to be sex slaves. That only covers a fraction of the plot, but the film never feels bogged down with explication and moves swiftly through its 100 minutes. Then again, if you want simply to absorb this as a balletic dumbshow, interspersed with ace fight scenes and populated by people wearing fantastic costumes, it’s just as satisfying an experience. • The Swordsman is released on 17 May on digital platforms.",The Swordsman,FILM
"361 ","The Secrets We Keep review – Noomi Rapace brings light and shade to pulpy drama               ","Set in the late 1950s in a geographically vague American suburban town where fin-tailed cars roll sedately through the streets and women wear dresses shaped like great silent bells, local doctor Lewis (Chris Messina) and his Romanian-born wife Maja (Noomi Rapace) and their grade-school son Patrick (Jackson Dean Vincent) look like everyone else pursuing the American dream. But as the title rather suggests, there are secrets afoot; quite a few in fact. They all start to come out when Maja spots a tall blond man (Joel Kinnaman, in fact, and, like Rapace, originally from Sweden) with just the faintest German accent. Maja is completely convinced this European, who says he’s a Swiss national named Thomas, is really a German named Carl who did unspeakable things towards the end of the war 15 years earlier. At first, she simply stalks him, wearing perfect little 50s sunglasses all the while. As she does so, the soundtrack plays a pastiche of the sort of suspenseful string music one might hear in an Alfred Hitchcock film from the period, like Vertigo or Rear Window or, as suggested by a cinema marquee Maja and the man happen to pass, North by Northwest. It’s heavy thematic nudges like this which rather tarnish some of the subtlety built up elsewhere in the film, where director Yuval Adler and the cast have performed a narrative fan dance, revealing and obscuring bits of backstory and adopting inscrutable expressions that cast doubt on everyone’s motives and veracity. Rapace is particularly good at seeming mysterious, neurotic, vulnerable and terrifyingly focused all at once when all she’s actually doing is smoking a cigarette and standing there. Messina and Kinnaman offer sturdy support and bring light and shade to their own roles just as well. All in all, it’s an engaging if pulpy drama. It’s the same kind conceit as the Costa-Gavras film Music Box – one that keeps the audience wondering if someone is or isn’t a Nazi throughout – and it is in essence a 50/50 coin flip with only two possible outcomes. But the film keeps the coin spinning through the air for a surprisingly long time. • The Secrets We Keep is available on 14 May on Sky Cinema and Now.",The Secrets We Keep,FILM
"362 ","Great White review – hangry shark thriller gets stuck in the shallows                         ","This Australian survival thriller gives us another global warming threat to worry about – hangry sharks. When a great white the size of a 4X4 starts chomping through holidaymakers, marine biologist Charlie (Aaron Jakubenko) is perplexed. Shark season is over – what’s it doing hanging about in Aussie waters? Might it have something to do with rising ocean temperatures, he wonders, or the shrinking fish population? Or maybe it’s the way that director Martin Wilson films human legs dangling so temptingly in the water? This is a killer shark movie with a semi-decent CGI great white, a predictable survival storyline, and all the familiar trappings: the pointed fin gliding menacingly towards dinner, the sea turning red, that creaky lurching sound of a boat bobbing on the ocean, signalling the calm before the attack. Charlie is actually a retired marine biologist, after being bitten by a shark. Now he works with his girlfriend Kat (Katrina Bowden), taking holidaymakers to beauty spots in their little seaplane. Business is sluggish but luckily a last-minute job comes their way, flying rich investment banker Joji (Tim Kano) and his wife Michelle (Kimie Tsukakoshi) to a remote bay. Clunkily, the script sets up tensions that will escalate later. Joji clashes with Benny (Te Kohe Tuhaka), the chef hired to cater the trip; Kat tells Charlie she’s pregnant. From these scenes you can predict the order of the shark’s menu. As soon as the seaplane lands on a beach, the five stumble over shark leftovers, the half-eaten remains of a young man. Foolhardily, they set off to look for his boat and survivors. Needless to say, they find the boat and with it the shark, who makes short shrift of their seaplane.

"363 ","Oxygen review – air runs out for claustrophobic survival nightmare                            ","Here is a single-location mystery thriller from first-time feature screenwriter Christie LeBlanc which is more than a bit on the preposterous side. It requires some hefty levels of disbelief suspension and plausibility buy-in. But the excellent Mélanie Laurent (from Quentin Tarantino’s Inglourious Basterds) sells it hard, and it’s a rather elegant contrivance, more restrained than usual from this director, the shlock-horror specialist Alexandre Aja. Laurent plays a woman who wakes up enclosed in a cryogenic hi-tech pod, slightly bigger than a coffin, surrounded by screens and readouts, hooked up to various life-support wires. She can’t remember who she is or why she is there, although she is almost immediately plagued with traumatised flashbacks of being rushed into hospital. Or is she rushing someone else into hospital? She can’t move. She can’t get out. And, increasingly, she can’t breathe. She realises that her oxygen levels will last only around a 100 minutes, the length of the film, in fact, which plays out in real time. And her only friend, the only one who can help her in this claustrophobic nightmare, is the velvety Hal-type voice of the controlling computer, drolly provided by Mathieu Amalric, which in time-honoured style is inscrutable, but with a hint that it knows more and could do more than it is letting on. It’s a high-concept script that reminded me a little of Rodrigo Cortés’s Buried from 2010, which the camera got up close and personal with Ryan Reynolds, who is buried alive – a metaphor for American involvement in Iraq. In some ways, this is a film for the Covid-lockdown era, although claiming its “oxygen” theme as contemporary commentary would not perhaps be in great taste. In some ways, this works better without the metaphorical reading – as just a far-fetched, but quite ingenious entertainment, with some bold climactic touches. • Oxygen is on Netflix.",Oxygen,FILM

The town has more than 50 golf courses and offers endless leisure opportunities, from bellydancing to karate, synchronised swimming to rowing. However, if this documentary is anything to go by, the town’s number-one hobby is dating. Director Lance Oppenheim takes a gentle approach, capturing some hilarious moments, but there’s nothing patronising or mean-spirited about his film. You could make an entire reality TV series about The Villages. Oppenheim keeps it simple with a handful of profiles. Anne and Reggie have been married for 47 years, but since retiring Reggie has been behaving erratically, taking up t’ai chi and hardcore hallucinogenics. Footage of him in court on possession charges is priceless. “When we got married, he wasn’t so unique,” says Anne diplomatically. Barbara from Boston is newly widowed and lonely. Then there is Dennis, an 81-year-old lothario with a leathery tan and a gold necklace. Dennis is not technically a Villages resident – he’s broke and lives in a camper van while trying to hook “a nice looking lady with some money”. Sidling over to a group of women by the pool, he looks like a jaunty, suntanned lizard. Sensibly, most of them give him a wide berth. Dennis used to be a showbiz handyman. “I did some work for President Ford,” he says to a woman who rolls her eyes. Give George Clooney 20 years and you could imagine him playing Dennis. One resident says that the American dream is a happy retirement. Anne is more circumspect. “We live in a bubble. It’s not the real world.” But the documentary was filmed before the pandemic, and in the past year there have been news reports of coronavirus test and vaccine shortages in The Villages. Also in 2020, Donald Trump tweeted a video that went viral of a resident shouting “white power”. The real world has arrived in The Villages.

Snyder was also the man who quit 2017’s Justice League after the death of his daughter, saw Joss Whedon take it over and deliver a flop that Snyder was advised by his wife and co-producer Christopher Nolan never to see, before a fan lobbying campaign prompted Warner to finish and release the so-called Snyder cut, a four-hour corker that became the unlikely hit of lockdown. This month, Snyder’s belated followup to his debut, Dawn of the Dead (2004), premieres on Netflix.

First up for the under-fives is Maya the Bee 3, the latest instalment of the sappy, sentimental franchise from Australia. In the new movie plucky little bee Maya (voiced by Coco Jack Gillies) and her best friend Willi (Benson Jack Anthony) get lumbered with transporting a golden egg to the ant colony at Bonsai Peak. Of course, the egg cracks en route, leaving the pair holding the ant baby – an adorable squidge they nickname Schmoosh. Cue some ant nappy-changing and lessons about responsibility. Weirdly, there is next to nothing specific about bees; with a little tweak here and there in the script, you could substitute bees for chipmunks or dinosaurs. The baby ant, it turns out, is a princess who is destined to become ruler of the colony. But a knucklehead, turbo-charged beetle with a six pack called Bumbulus (Christian Charisiou) tries to kidnap her so that he can run the ants off the mountain. Like the Incredible Hulk of the insect world, he bounces through the undergrowth with his goons. The film is bright and sunny, and the sense of life at ground level is nicely done in places. Everyone in this world is food for another creature; even the beetles cower when a cute little birdie swoops in looking for breakfast. Still, it’s cheap-looking and dismally low on fun.

The opening scene of director Ivan Ostrochovský’s stylish political thriller, co-written with Rebecca Lenkiewicz and Marek Lescák, plays like a film noir, with its high-contrast monochrome cinematography and empty, rain-slicked streets. The Czech film-maker’s second feature is set in 1980, three decades into then-Czechoslovakia’s communist rule. Teenage students Juraj (Samuel Skyva) and Michal (Samuel Polakovic) swap their sweater vests for cassocks at a seminary, not yet realising that it has been infiltrated by the regime. The dean (Vladimír Strnisko) and his students are watched closely by Doctor Ivan (a menacing Vlad Ivanov), even though the dean is a member of Pacem in Terris, the real-life association of priests who collaborated with the state.

The chilling image of a heap of confiscated typewriters – 64 of them – piled in the back of a truck is a potent assertion that personal ethics and independent thought pose a genuine threat to authoritarian rule. Ostrochovský’s camera emphasises the constricting architecture of both church and state, with its black and white morality and a claustrophobic central courtyard, frequently portrayed via stiff, judgmental God’s-eye shots. • On Curzon Home Cinema",Servants,FILM
"368 ","Those Who Wish Me Dead review – Jolie smoulders in predictable thriller                       ","Angelina Jolie is almost believable as Hannah, a damaged, foul-mouthed firefighter stationed in a Montana forest, where she must protect 12-year-old Connor (Finn Little), whose father is being pursued by two very efficient hitmen (Aidan Gillen and Nicholas Hoult). Director Taylor Sheridan (Wind River) plays to Jolie’s streak of wildness, but even in smoke-smudged makeup and Carhartt trousers she looks a little too much like a movie star. That’s possibly part of the pleasure of this popcorn movie, which starts strongly as a tense action thriller. Unfortunately, the second half is over-reliant on flashy disaster set pieces, blazing towards a predictable, melodramatic conclusion. • In cinemas from 17 May",Those Who Wish Me Dead,FILM
"369 ","Some Kind of Heaven review – a deadpan eye on Florida’s retirees                              ","“You don’t come here to die, you come here to live!” cheers one of the residents of the Villages, in Florida. The postcard-perfect community of some 120,000 old folks has been called Disneyland for retirees, and is the subject of Lance Oppenheim’s spry, occasionally surreal documentary. The film hones in on four idiosyncratic characters: grumpy widow Barbara, recreational drug enthusiast Reggie and his long-suffering wife Anne, and gold-digger Dennis, who lives in his van and works the Villages’ bars and swimming pools hoping to pick up a moneyed mistress. A scene in which Oppenheim gathers a room full of smiling women all called Elaine is straight out of a David Lynch movie. It’d be easy to mistake the director’s deadpan observation for mocking, but the space he holds for the darker aspects of his characters’ individual stories helps to puncture any cultivated cutesyness.

"370 ","Homewrecker review – suburban hostage caper is a cheerier Misery                              ","It’s a pity this Canadian comedy-horror is too crudely put together to comfortably straddle its two genres, because it contains some zesty bursts of invention and bright performances from its leads. Precious Chong, who co-writes with director Zach Gayne and co-star Alex Essoe, takes one for the team with her unlikable role: belligerently perky fortysomething singleton Linda, who imposes herself on interior designer Michelle (Essoe) while in a coffee shop. Somehow, Linda’s invasive questions about Michelle’s baby-making plans doesn’t stop the latter agreeing to remodel Linda’s house – and heading straight round for a look-see. What starts as a teeth-grating test in how Michelle can politely extricate herself (Linda insists on pre-midday cocktails), turns into a suburban hostage-taking. Chong – with her sociopathic chat, hairpin mood-swerves and neediness – is like a Lycra-clad version of Misery’s Annie Wilkes. But this suspense-free film is not deft enough to turn the dial back and forth, as Rob Reiner’s film did, between scary, absurd and blackly comic. Instead, it plays the abduction 100% bubbly, even during bouts of awkwardly staged violence. If this hobbles the film, Homewrecker is at least adept at devising new torments for Michelle, including one scene in which Linda forces her to play throwback 80s boardgame Party Hunks. This encapsulation of her time-capsuled emotional life leads to reflections on honesty in relationships and life, and there is something endearing about how doggedly Homewreckers pursues this theme. But fundamentally, it never finds a convincing pitch. A tone-deaf musical score that drenches everything – pained comedy, catty exchanges, brawling – in guitar reverb, really doesn’t help.

"371 ","Death Will Come and Shall Have Your Eyes review – a strangely comforting end                  ","Chilean film-maker José Luis Torres Leiva’s new drama is a thoughtful treatment of terminal illness. It gets under the skin and into the thoughts of two women: a couple, and one of them is dying of cancer. Torres Leiva wrote the script after losing three friends to the illness. His film is anti-sentimental, a tough watch, as they say; the kind that can leave you feeling a little fragile. But it’s sensitive, too, and beautifully acted. Ana (Amparo Noguera) and María (Julieta Figueroa) are in their 40s. The film opens with the two of them in a car. María in the passenger seat gently instructs driver Ana to close her eyes, and for a tense moment Ana drives blind, scared. Afterwards, we discover that María has terminal cancer. What was she doing in that moment in the car? Giving Ana a glimmer of her own terror of the darkness? We watch as the women pack up their apartment in the city and move to a cabin in the forest, where María has chosen to die. Not much is said; the dialogue would probably fit on to a dozen or so typed pages. Torres Leiva is more interested in the emotional weather, the way the two women gaze at each other, or a hand resting on a shoulder. In the bath, María loses her temper with Ana for treating her like a child, and rages at her illness. Two sizable digressions in the middle spoil the film a little. One dramatises a strange fairytale María tells about a naked feral girl living alone in the forest; the other is a family story about her uncle. Both felt a bit generically arthouse, slightly awkward experiments. Overall, it’s a tough watch but in its way gently reassuring. As it can be in life, watching people living with death is strangely comforting – it makes it feel doable somehow. • Death Will Come and Shall Have Your Eyes is available on 19 May on Mubi.",Death Will Come and Shall Have Your Eyes,FILM
"372 ","Why Not You review – a hollow depiction of homophobic violence                                ","Here’s yet another film that falls disappointingly flat when the film-makers are more preoccupied with delivering topical messages than outlining nuanced characters. Why Not You tries hard to comment on a mosaic of issues – homophobia, addiction, PTSD, religious extremism – yet ends up hollow and emotionally vapid. The debut feature from Evi Romen, a seasoned film editor, the film’s visual flair sometimes makes up for the jumbled plot, which follows Mario (Thomas Prenn), an aspiring queer dancer at odds with his conservative community in the primarily German-speaking South Tyrol, Italy. With a penchant for wigs and nail polish, he dreams of bigger cities and the personal freedom they promise. Tragedy strikes on a trip to a gay bar in Rome with Lenz (Noah Saavedra), a close friend with whom Mario shares an intense sexual tension. Islamic extremists open fire on the patrons; Lenz dies while Mario survives. Grief, coupled with intense guilt, sends Mario spiralling further into a cycle of addiction until he crosses path with a local Muslim community willing to rehabilitate the self-destructive man. Despite dealing with a host of hot-button subjects, the film has a cavalier approach that borders on distastefulness. In the aftermath of the terrorist attack, the camera glides leisurely around the gay bar, showing lifeless, bloody bodies artistically placed among the destruction. Regardless of how cinematic this looks, aestheticising violence against queer people is morally questionable. The Muslim characters also come off as deeply simplistic: they are either terrorists or benevolent agents, all mere plot points for the white protagonist’s character development. While the shortcomings are numerous, the film does feel authentic in how it captures the landscape and the spirit of the South Tyrol, an environment rarely inspected by cinema. Such attention and care, alas, does not extend to the film’s emotional and political issues. • Why Not You is released on 24 May on digital platforms.",Why Not You,FILM
"373 ","The Dog Who Wouldn’t Be Quiet review – a mini masterwork                                      ","Give this movie 73 minutes, and it will give you the world … somebody’s world, anyway. Argentinian film-maker Ana Katz has created an intriguing and beguiling little black-and-white drama that’s punching way above its weight. It’s a series of scenes or vignettes, like a collection of short stories, each about the same person, a little older each time. This is Sebastián, or Sebas, a gentle, laid-back man in his 30s, played by the director’s brother Daniel Katz. Sebas is an intelligent guy, a graphic designer, trained in the use of Adobe Illustrator, but now trying to get temp jobs, made more difficult because he’s not allowed to take his dog into the office, and leaving him at home makes the poor thing howl with misery so much that the neighbours are upset. Sebas gets work as a carer, then with a co-operative group selling vegetables from a truck, then he appears to be podcasting about inequality. He meets a woman at his widowed mum’s second-time-around wedding, and things develop romantically. His life rolls on, or rather, it proceeds in little forward hops. In some scenes he’s got short hair, in some scenes it’s long; sometimes he’s got a beard and sometimes no beard. Each scene is hardly more than a dramatised glimpse, an extended closeup, a fragment of a life – but Katz makes the part stand for the whole with masterly, understated skill. And just when you think this is going to be an essentially parochial tale, Katz takes us into what might be sci-fi, or brilliant prophecy. The fall of a meteor creates a health emergency requiring people to wear astronaut-type respirator helmets if they want to walk upright (the air is not breathable unless you hunch down like Groucho Marx). This film is enigmatic and yet very digestible, deadpan in its comedy and so insouciant and casual in its form, you might almost think that Katz had written it in five minutes, filmed it in a week. There is real artistry here. • The Dog Who Wouldn’t Be Quiet is released on 21 May on Curzon Home Cinema.",The Dog Who Wouldn’t Be Quiet,FILM
"374 ","Radhe review – Salman Khan blockbuster is a cheap dash through the fight tropes               ","What was originally scheduled as India’s big Eid blockbuster for May 2020 is opening a year later in cinemas everywhere but India itself, where it came out on streaming platforms last weekend. In his guise as producer-megastar, musclebound Salman Khan has dispatched his minions to hollow out the taut narrative chicanery of 2017’s Korean thriller The Outlaws and reconfigure its carcass into the kind of flattering vehicle only a powerful Bollywood leading man can command. Despite some early welcome flickers of the kind of self-awareness that’s crept into Khan’s projects over the past half-decade, the result is very much back-to-basics. The more knowing nonsense only serves to make the eventual slump into third-rate pummelling more dispiriting. Most of that nonsense, which prompts fitful back-row giggles, concerns Khan’s indomitable hero cop Radhe. “He has his own methods of working,” insists one of the Mumbai police chiefs recruiting him to protect the city’s youth from straggle-haired druglord Randeep Hooda. These include: never entering via the door when he can leap face-first through a glass window, manifesting in multiple locations simultaneously so as to better box his quarries’ ears, and – less amusingly – casually torturing suspects. A chance encounter with poster-girl Diya (Disha Patani) encourages our man to try male modelling; this love interest, naturally, turns out to be the sister of Radhe’s ever more exasperated CO (Jackie Shroff). Don’t ask about the 35-year age gap between these siblings; no one behind the camera clearly bothered. While a jocular, self-mocking Khan is still preferable to the puppy-eyed sentimentalist who made 2017’s Tubelight and 2019’s Bharat such ordeals, there’s an awful lot of self to mock here, and not nearly enough craft to counterbalance that ego. Hired to glam up an expensive-looking nightclub number, guest star Jacqueline Fernandez gets elbowed out of sight once Radhe storms the stage to prat around. Quality control gets shoved off soon after. One bathroom punch-up is shot on such cheap, smeary digital it resembles rehearsal footage. Even the fun stuff is low-grade and limited, because our guy’s heroism is forever meant to be taken as sacrosanct. Director Prabhu Deva’s cursory dash through the not-so-grand finale suggests he clearly wanted it over; you may do, too. • Radhe is released in the UK on 17 May in cinemas.",Radhe,FILM
"375 ","Redoubt review – Matthew Barney’s mysterious, mythical movie-ballet","Redoubt is a wordless outdoor movie-ballet inspired by the huntress myth of Diana, set in the forested wilderness of Idaho’s Sawtooth mountains and brought to us by artist and film-maker Matthew Barney, whose most famous work is probably his colossal five-film sequence, the Cremaster Cycle. Cremaster was a headspinningly gigantic folie de grandeur spanning six hours in total, inspired by the interrelation of biology and creativity. Redoubt is a more modest two-and-a-quarter hours, part of an art installation including sculptures and engravings, originally commissioned by Yale University. Barney plays a hardy outdoorsman, an engraver who hikes around the wilderness, making etchings on an engraving plate; his redoubt appears to be a modest trailer which he shares with a woman (KJ Holmes), perhaps his wife or partner, who electroplates the resulting work in a chemical bath. But the engraver is in a mysterious state of antagonism, or at least wary coexistence, with three women in the forest who are hunting wolves: Diana (played by real-life sharpshooter and NRA member Anette Wachter), and her “Calling Virgin” and “Tracking Virgin” (played by the dancers Eleanor Bauer and Laura Stokes) who are dressed in camo, carry serious rifles and hardware; the Virgins go into strange, showy dance moves in the snow (which, it has to be said, rather negates the importance of camouflage and not revealing yourself to the prey). Wolves and other animals get shot, though a final note on the credits assures us that this is just an effect. Could it be that the engraver himself is destined, like Actaeon in the myth, to be the prey? It is a handsome-looking film, with a strange and compelling soundtrack by Jonathan Bepler. Redoubt is about humanity’s relationship with nature and the business of hunting itself (and the presence of gun enthusiast Wachter implies that the film can’t be interpreted as straightforwardly opposed to hunting). I wondered how much really was being said, in the end, but Barney has a bold and distinctive style. • Redoubt is released on 20 May on Mubi, and is also screening on 19 May-25 July at Matthew Barney: Redoubt at the Hayward Gallery, London.",Redoubt,FILM
"376 ","The Auschwitz Escape review – death camp’s secrets uncovered in powerful drama                ","In 1944, two Jewish Slovaks, Rudolf Vrba (Peter Ondrejička) and Alfred Wetzler (Noel Czuczor), both of them prisoners at Auschwitz-Birkenau, hide in some wooden pallets and wait for a moment to escape. Carrying documents that will prove what is really happening in the extermination camp, they manage to make it through the fence and into the forest, an escape that precious few managed. Meanwhile, those who stayed behind, some of whom risked their lives to help Vrba and Wetzler escape, are cruelly punished by the camp guards. This dramatised account of a true story plays like a grim high-stakes thriller as we root for the two men to make it over the border. Their names may be unfamiliar, but even for those who know about the Auschwitz Protocols – a report to which the pair contributed that has a weighty legacy in Holocaust history – the film is still intensely impactful. Inevitably, it is profoundly upsetting and disturbing. Nevertheless, Slovak director Peter Bebjack has managed to make a film that relates this chapter of history in a new way, employing inventive cinematic techniques to present the material. For instance, Bebjak and cinematographer Martin Ziaran often film the action with an upside-down camera, thus mimicking the point of view of the protagonists. The colours are all bleached out to a near monochrome palette, soggy and grey as the Polish mud. Elsewhere, flashbacks and dreams intermingle to keep you always a little off balance. Long takes track slowly through scenes of horror, and a few sequences take place in a darkened room where hundreds of naked corpses are stacked up like lumber. It is particularly upsetting that this last setting is barely noticed by the characters as they go about their business, as if they see this sort of thing every day. The acting is extraordinary throughout, especially from the two leads, and John Hannah offers a beautifully underplayed cameo as a Red Cross employee who almost can’t believe his ears towards the end of the film. • The Auschwitz Escape is released on 14 May on digital platforms.",The Auschwitz Escape,FILM
"377 ","The 8th review – the stirring story behind Ireland’s pro-choice triumph                       ","Two years after the UK’s remainer liberals lost the EU referendum, Irish campaigners fighting to repeal the constitution’s eighth amendment forbidding abortion showed them how you win this kind of vote: with real passion, real vision and real determination not to take anything for granted. In 2018, Ireland’s pro-choice voters won the referendum handsomely – 66% on a 64% turnout – an inspiring story told in this spirited documentary by Aideen Kane, Lucy Kennedy and Maeve O’Boyle. So many of Ireland’s women, particularly its young women, were infuriated by the years of being told that their experiences, their health and their safety were quite irrelevant compared with those scruples declaimed by thin-lipped reactionaries of church and state. What galvanised the campaign was the horrific story of Savita Halappanavar, the Indian woman who in 2012 died in University Hospital Galway after a septic miscarriage because a termination was not permitted; the pure shame of that event energised the movement. The abortion issue is unique, in secular political terms, for the absolute impossibility of dialogue between the two sides, and in fact the pro-choice activists in this film conform to their side’s traditional unwillingness to spell out their baseline beliefs: the foetus does not become fully eligible for human rights until it is a separate entity and has left the mother’s body. Anti-abortionists believe, on the contrary, that this happens on conception, in the womb. It is a fundamentalist belief that in Ireland has traditionally won the day. But pro-choice women were sick of being lectured and sorrowingly told they were the useful idiots of evil – particularly as this political stance came as part and parcel of a general contempt for women’s rights, of which the Magdalene laundries scandal was another grisly part. Pro-choice activists won with a campaign that declined to go negative, and, indeed, may have benefited from the attraction of its exuberant “Yes” motif. Now they face decades of vigilance to defend their gains. The 8th is released on 25 May in cinemas and on digital platforms.",The 8th,FILM
"378 ","Peter Rabbit 2 tops box office as UK’s reopened cinemas take £2m in three days                ","A strong summer at the UK cinema looks like an increasingly realistic prospect following three impressive days at the box office. Cinemas were permitted to open their doors at 50% capacity on Monday, and film-lovers eager for a fix – or appalled by the weather – showed little hesitancy following seven months of smaller screens. Wednesday’s total was estimated to be around £760,000, up 41% from Tuesday, in part because of 120 Cineworld sites reopening that day, having remained closed on Monday and Tuesday. The three-day total is around £2.8m. Topping the chart is Peter Rabbit 2, the sequel to the 2018 hit, whose release has been long delayed because of the pandemic. Other healthy performers include Nomadland and Godzilla vs Kong, with audiences opting to see them on the big screen despite their availability on streaming platforms. Spiral: From the Book of Saw and The Unholy are also in the Top 5, with the bottom of the Top 10 entirely dominated by Warner Bros titles: Mortal Kombat, Judas and the Black Messiah, Those Who Wish Me Dead, Tom &amp; Jerry and The Little Things.

"379 ","Pink: All I Know So Far review – parenting meets perilous pop stardom                         ","The title of this fly-on-the-wall documentary following the pop star Pink and family on her 2018-19 world tour is taken from a recent song in which the Pennsylvanian lung-buster explains her life thus far to her daughter Willow. Traipsing round various European cities, we learn en route that the singer also wrote letters, to be read in the future, to her eldest child on the day she was born and on her first day at kindergarten. Her commitment to her two kids – which goes as far as taking them on tour – is touching, and Pink fans will doubtless be hopping at the prospect of being invited into the domestic circle. But this undemanding work, directed by The Greatest Showman’s Michael Gracey, comes across a bit like another family memento for their own mantelpiece. “Re-sil-ience,” is how Pink chops up a difficult word for her two-year-old, Jameson. Dealing in similarly manageable chunks with the biathlon of parenting and high-end stadium performance that is her life must be the only way of getting through it. The singer is admirably hands-on with both her children (with husband Carey Hart on daddy day care), as well as working out the details of a painstakingly choreographed stage show that at points is close to musical theatre. One interesting point is the physical strain on her: the film points out that the former gymnast often simultaneously sings and performs acrobatics, two activities that pull in different directions. Her wire stunts on show at Wembley stadium, dozens of feet above the arena floor, are truly hair-raising. (Perhaps that explains the coiffure.) But there is little narrative, beyond the Wembley gig approaching; and, more crucially, little conflict, outer or inner. Gracey lets Pink run with too much bland affirmational musing, ranging from the diverse family that is her crew, to the self-actualising lifestyle in which she is raising her children. This all serves to bolster her Streisandesque diva status, but it comes across as a bit self-congratulatory. The fanbase will cheer the fact she has outgrown the self-questioning and fractured home life – cursorily detailed here – from which she made her early career. But that happiness – notoriously difficult to make drama out of – is perhaps left to her songs. • Pink: All I Know So Far is released on Amazon Prime Video on 21 May.",Pink: All I Know So Far,FILM
"380 ","PG: Psycho Goreman review – controlling a demon alien is child’s play                         ","Siblings Mimi (Nita-Josee Hanna, outrageously talented), a ferocious force of nature, and her timid older brother Luke (Owen Myre, also terrific) find a strange, glowing gem while messing around in the dirt. Turns out it summons a blue-hued, bad-tempered alien (actor Matthew Ninaber under a ton of makeup and prosthetics) from the planet Gygax; considered a “demon” by his enemies, he describes himself as “the archduke of nightmares”. However, once Mimi works out they can control him with the gem, she renames him Psycho Goreman, or PG for short. Delighted with this new source of power, Mimi goes on to prove there is truly no force in the universe more capricious, cruel and catty than a 12-year-old who can have anything they want. Soon, she is forcing PG to turn her brother’s friend Alasdair (Scout Flint) into a squat monster that looks like a giant brain with craft-shop googly eyes, as well as compelling everyone to play a ridiculously otiose sport she made up, the rules of which take hours to explain. Writer-director Steven Kostanski is a wee bit over-reliant on bathos to generate humour; just about every laugh is generated by PG declaiming something menacing or committing an act of violence and then being treated like a naughty puppy by Mimi. Nevertheless, the gag is worked over from enough different angles to keep it funny, and it helps that Hanna, Ninaber and the rest of the cast have acute comic timing and know how to sell the material. Meanwhile, the makeup effects for PG, Alasdair and a whole menagerie of alien monsters are unnervingly moist and menacing. It’s no surprise to learn Kostanski has worked as a special makeup artist on bigger budget projects such as Suicide Squad and It, but this proves he has a way with actors as much as a knack for latex and fake blood. • PG: Psycho Goreman is available on Shudder from 20 May.",PG: Psycho Goreman,FILM
"381 ","The Philosophers review – thought-experiment thriller is hilariously bad                      ","John Huddles’s sci-fi thriller unintentionally succeeds in replicating the exact experience of playing “would you rather?” with a friend in a pub, as in it starts out with vague philosophical questions but ends up being utterly ridiculous. And just like the silly game, for the right viewers The Philosophers could be quite a fun watch, despite the sub-par film-making. The film opens with a sweet love scene between Petra (Sophie Lowe) and James (Rhys Wakefield), shot with an awful Vaseline-like sheen that plagues the entire film’s cinematography. Petra and James meet on a philosophy course, which, for some reason, takes place in Indonesia – and yet most of the students are white. For the final class, their professor Mr Zimit (James D’Arcy) proposes some light role play: he devises an extreme situation where the students face an apocalyptic event and must decide who earns a place in the safety bunker. The sci-fi elements kick in as the film sets these thought experiments into motion and showcases various scenic Indonesian locations. While the premise is interesting enough, and it is refreshing to see sci-fi elements used to visualise philosophical problems, The Philosophers, to be honest, is nonsense. Don’t expect to learn any actual philosophy here; these thought experiments favour randomised dramatic incidents over logical reasoning. The dialogue and the acting are also hilariously bad; at one point, a character says, with a straight face: “We need to get a pregnancy going as fast as we can.” However, it’s difficult to write this movie off completely: there is some pleasure to be had in watching these students attempt to solve the different iterations of the experiment over and over, like advancing through the stages of a video game.

Philippe Falardeau (Monsieur Lazhar) directs and Margaret Qualley stars as aspiring writer Joanna, who finds work assisting grande dame literary agent Margaret (Sigourney Weaver). Margaret’s main client is JD Salinger; Joanna’s duties include shredding his fanmail and replying with a crisply dismissing pro forma response that hasn’t been updated since the late 60s. But just as Salinger’s literature touches the lives of his fans, their heartfelt words (spoken to camera in clunky vignettes) connect with Joanna, incrementally inching her towards dumping her overconfident talent vacuum of a boyfriend and following her dream. It’s all perfectly pleasant, with polite pacing and a smothering, over-solicitous score. But any film that can take an actor as sparky as Qualley and deliver a character with the personality of a damp dishcloth wrapped in a cardigan is seriously underusing its year in New York.",My New York Year,FILM

It begins at a frat house party where alpha-scumbag Beau (Gattlin Griffith) sets his aim with sniper precision at Kylie (Isabella Gomez), the drunkest, most-eager-to-fit-in of the new sorority intake. Beau offers to take her to the upstairs bathroom; instead he guides her into his bedroom with another guy, Wes (Froy Gutierrez), and locks the door. The next day Kylie tells sorority president Ellery (Lindsay LaVanchy) that she thinks she might have been assaulted. The frat boys tag her as a “slut” on social media. (Irritatingly, the characters’ messages and social feeds are constantly pinging up on the screen.) Ellery, a science major, takes the investigation into her own hands at the DNA lab where she works part-time. Meanwhile, a masked psychopath turns up on campus, stalking and killing the suspected perpetrators and anyone else who might be complicit. The kills get boring very quickly; I’ve seen cheese-grater injuries that were more grisly. And perhaps the biggest shocker here is that these kids are glued to their phones 24/7, but not one of them manages to dial 911 in time. The procedural side of things is pretty hopeless. The script throws out half a dozen creepy male characters, any one of whom could be the killer. There’s Ellery’s socially awkward incel-y boss at the lab (Maxwell Hamilton), and the college principal (Lochlyn Munro), who’s hushed up previous allegations. What about that nice cop (Jon Huertas) – doesn’t he maintain eye contact for a split second too long? The unmasking of the killer at the end is completely nonsensical in what is essentially a perpetrator-focused film; Kylie, the alleged victim, gets a couple of scenes, necessary for the plot, but otherwise, there’s practically zero interest in what she’s going through. • Initiation is released on 24 May on digital platforms.",Initiation,FILM
"384 ","The Human Factor review – gripping account of three decades of Middle East peace talks        ","It’s barely conceivable now, with the conflict between Israel and Palestine at its most destructive in years, but for a while at least, an accord in the Middle East was a tantalising possibility. This fascinating, balanced documentary from the Oscar-nominated Israeli film-maker Dror Moreh (The Gatekeepers) does for behind-the-scenes statecraft and diplomacy what Errol Morris’s 2003 film The Fog of War did for military strategy. Moreh’s gripping account of three decades of the Middle East peace process is simple in approach, sharing with The Gatekeepers an emphasis on insight, analysis and expertise. In this case, the fluctuating tensions between Israel and its neighbours Palestine and Syria are recounted by the US negotiators tasked with brokering something that one of them, senior diplomatic interpreter Gamal Helal, was reluctant to even label as “peace”, arguing that the word itself was loaded with unrealistic expectations. When the schisms between the two sides even extend to semantics – the Arab concept of “future” differed from that of the US and Israelis – it’s remarkable that they came as close as they did to an agreement. We learn that negotiation is a delicate structure that is all too easily toppled by the whims of powerful men. Something as inconsequential as Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat’s fondness for uniforms could come close to scuppering months of precision-tooled arbitration. And the “human factor” was crucial, encompassing everything from the mutual respect between Yitzhak Rabin and Arafat, to the all too human errors of judgment that, interviewees concede, may have cost them the chance of peace.",The Human Factor,FILM

But this instalment of Peter Rabbit is filtered through the kind of sly self-awareness that suggests the film-makers took on board the criticisms of the previous film and decided to run with them. Thus there’s a repeated joke about Peter’s annoying voice (James Corden returns as the lead bunny) and a meta gag about the commercial pressures that sever the screen adventures of Peter and chums from their chintzy Beatrix Potter origins. Yes, the shadow of Paddington looms large. But there are some genuinely funny moments, and the madcap action set pieces – particularly a farmers’ market heist – are giddily inventive. Fur rendering and CGI is first-rate, for the animals at least. The humans fare less well: as Mr McGregor, the CGI Domhnall Gleeson at times looks like a collection of overstretched slinky springs in a man suit.",Peter Rabbit 2: the Runaway,FILM
"387 ","Nasrin review – this is what a superhero looks like in the real world                         ","This clandestinely shot documentary about Iranian human-rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh reveals what superheroism looks like in the real world. As significant as the tireless work in lawyer’s cabinets, drab constitutional courts and prison visiting rooms is her symbolic importance: her sinewy persistence and true courage in standing up to Iran’s dogmatic regime have the potential to ignite such qualities in others, and unlock the collective action needed to shift this sclerotic society. Narrated by Olivia Colman, the film details how this one-time journalist began practising law in 2003, specialising in representing minorities, opposition activists and minors on death row – all groups denied the human rights Iran’s clerics claim are incompatible with Islamic values. Sotoudeh was arrested for endangering state security in 2010, and served more than two years in Tehran’s Evin prison, where she undertook a 50-day hunger strike. The totalitarianism she is fighting against is on display in one scene where, advocating for an activist on trial at the Revolutionary Court, Sotoudeh asks for evidence to back the charge of colluding with foreign powers. There is none. An apparatchik demands to know why she is “defending true bandits, who are homosexuals, Baha’is, prostitutes, terrorists and street and wilderness thugs”. This Orwellian modus operandi, rewriting reality as the regime needs, is supposedly in the service of upholding traditional values. But on some level, the regime holds family in contempt too. As seen through Sotoudeh’s husband Reza’s weariness, this is evidently their first point of attack, the interminable prison sentences psychologically designed to break down this unit of solidarity. Sotoudeh’s legal work and street activism show the value of strategic resistance, and are timed when – for domestic or international reasons – they are most likely to extract concessions. In concert with other high-profile dissenters, such as director Jafar Panahi, in whose film Taxi she appears, she seems to be making headway – especially following reformist cleric Hassan Rouhani’s election as president in 2013. But there is no redemptive final act. The film finishes in 2018, when Sotoudeh was rearrested and sentenced to 38 years and 148 lashes. That was commuted, but she remains incarcerated. • Nasrin is available on 28 May on True Story.",Nasrin,FILM

According to Deadline, the Oscar-nominated star of Call Me by Your Name will follow in the footsteps of Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp in an all-singing and all-dancing performance in a prequel inspired by Roald Dahl’s book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The film will focus on the early years of Wonka before he opened his factory. Paul King, director of Paddington, will be at the helm with a screenplay from comedian Simon Farnaby. It will mark the third time Warner Brothers has brought the character to life, first in 1971 and then in 2005 with Tim Burton’s adaptation, which made $475m worldwide. The story was also turned into a successful musical. Last year it was announced that Taika Waititi, director of Thor: Ragnarok, would also be taking on two animated series for Netflix based on the world and characters of Dahl’s 1964 novel. The streamer has promised that the shows will “retain the quintessential spirit and tone of the original story while building out the world and characters far beyond the pages of the Dahl book for the very first time”. The 25-year-old actor was last seen in Greta Gerwig’s adaptation of Little Women and his upcoming films include Wes Anderson’s The French Dispatch, Denis Villeneuve’s take on Dune, marking his first major franchise role, and Adam McKay’s star-studded asteroid comedy Don’t Look Up alongside Jennifer Lawrence, Leonardo DiCaprio, Meryl Streep and Ariana Grande.

"389 ","Hello, It’s Me! review – mysteries of love and science in wartime Armenia","This intriguing and mysterious romantic drama from 1966 is directed by Armenian film-maker Frunze Dovlatyan; it was entered into competition at Cannes that year and is now rereleased. Hello, It’s Me! often has that kind of freewheeling breeziness that you might associate with the 60s; at other times, I found myself thinking of Max Ophüls’s Letter from an Unknown Woman. The distinguished Armenian stage and screen actor Armen Dzhigarkhanyan plays a fictional young scientist called Artyom, based on the real-life figure of Artem Alikhanian, who during the second world war became one of the pioneers of Soviet nuclear physics. (He shares this distinction, incidentally, with the great Soviet scientist Lev Landau, whose life story was the unlikely inspiration for Ilya Khrzhanovsky’s epic movie installation project Dau.) Artyom has a deep friendship with his comrade and colleague Oleg (Rolan Bykov) and is deeply in love with Lyusya (Natalya Fateeva). But the war shatters everything in his personal life, even as it accelerates his scientific work. Lyusya – a sergeant in the Red Army – is suddenly ordered to the front, where she is to be killed in action, having had no time to say goodbye to Artyom. Her desperate attempt, as she is scrambling on board a troop train, to get a message to him via a child, is the nearest to a farewell they had. Artyom, meanwhile, is sent to Mount Aragats in the remote Armenian highlands to set up the Cosmic Ray Research Station, considered by the authorities of great wartime importance, and is separated from Oleg. After the war, there is regret and sadness in Artyom’s life, complicated by an enigmatic new relationship with a beautiful young woman called Tanya (Margarita Terekhova, later to play the lead in Tarkovsky’s Mirror), whose destiny was entwined with Artyom’s from the very beginning. It really is a very strange film: abstruse scientific work is juxtaposed with romanticism, yearning, loneliness, eroticism and a mystified acceptance of the workings of fate. • Hello, It’s Me! is available from 25 May on Klassiki. •This article was amended on 24 May 2021 to correct the film’s release date in the standfirst","Hello, It’s Me!",FILM

The entertainment world has been working overtime filling in villain backstories lately, providing excuses and rationales for everyone from Joker to Maleficent, Hannibal to Nurse Ratched. Next up we have Disney’s Cruella, explaining what turned the 101 Dalmatians vamp from promising fashion designer to puppy-skinning wrong-un. What’s left when even a mass pet-killer is worthy of rehabilitation? Well, if you’re listening, Hollywood, here are a few ideas … Scar Face Jeff, as he was known back then, is the handsomest, most popular lion on the savannah. He is a gifted wildlife artist, and a vegetarian. Jeff’s prayers are answered when a comely lioness asks him to paint her portrait, but his brother Mufasa gets jealous and sends round the baboon mafia to mess him up. The disfigured Jeff falls into a radioactive waterhole, which turns him evil.

A serial killer is hunting down Jaws’s family. Accompanied by a wisecracking halibut and a stoner squid, our hero sets off to find the culprit. They fail, so decide to eat everyone instead.

"391 ","Drunk Bus review – endearing odd couple keep slacker comedy on track                          ","Packed with a host of off-kilter characters and traversing some over-familiar indie terrain, this slacker comedy co-directed by John Carlucci and Brandon LaGanke could easily have seemed grating. Nevertheless, believable performances, along with a deep understanding of place, lend Drunk Bus a cheeriness that is entertaining and heartwarming. Just like the creaky campus bus that he has driven around the same route every night for the past four years, recent graduate Michael (Charlie Tahan) is stuck in a depressing loop. His Catholic girlfriend Amy (Sarah Mezzanotte) has left him for New York, while the still-virgin Michael remains in Kent, Ohio. His daily dealings with drunk students and aggressive, burrito-throwing frat boys bear the same approach: meek numbness and exasperated acceptance. His directionless apathy changes when, after a minor scuffle, Pineapple (Pineapple Tangaroa), an intimidating-looking Samoan security guard with a full facial tattoo, is assigned to protect the bus. The pair make for an endearing odd couple as Pineapple nudges Michael on to a more carefree path. While Pineapple could have easily fallen into something similar to the “Magical Negro” trope, where a non-white character functions as a life coach for the white protagonist – and admittedly the script does occasionally veer in this direction – Tangaroa is such a hugely charismatic performer that he rises above such constraints. The film also balances out the quirkiness – a character is nicknamed Night Tara because she has night terrors – with a real appreciation for Kent itself. It is a dead town, yes, but Drunk Bus captures the spirit of the community there: by showing the local diner or the snowy, sloping streets where the characters slide around. While the mix of drama and comedy is shaky, Drunk Bus is still a rewarding watch. • Drunk Bus is released on 24 May on digital platforms.",Drunk Bus,FILM
"392 ","Lindsay Lohan is back – as Netflix signs her for Christmas romcom                             ","Lindsay Lohan has been signed up by Netflix for Christmas movie as she aims to restart her stalled film acting career. Variety reports that Lohan has signed up to appear in a seasonally themed romantic comedy for the streaming giant, which has made a practice out of releasing such films in recent years, including The Christmas Chronicles, Home for Christmas and A Family Reunion Christmas. According to Variety, Lohan will play a “newly engaged, spoiled hotel heiress [who] finds herself in the care of a handsome, blue-collar lodge owner and his precocious daughter in the days leading up to Christmas” after a skiing accident renders her with memory loss. The film, as yet untitled, is to be directed and co-written by Janeen Damian, and is likely to be ready for Christmas 2022. Lohan’s acting jobs have been sporadic since appearing in the Paul Schrader-directed The Canyons in 2013, with a supporting role in the werewolf thriller Among the Shadows in 2019 her only film credit. She also appeared in an episode of 2 Broke Girls in 2014, and as a regular character in the second series of the Rupert Grint sitcom Sick Note in 2018. She also accrued largely positive reviews for the 2014 West End production of David Mamet’s play Speed-the-Plow. Lohan’s success as a child actor, in the 1998 remake of The Parent Trap and the 2003 version of Freaky Friday, as well as the cult hit Mean Girls in 2004, was followed by highly publicised personal and legal difficulties, including substance abuse, driving-offence convictions, probation violations, jail time and spells in rehab. Lohan subsequently featured in reality TV shows, including Lindsay, which followed her recovery attempts in 2014, and Lindsay Lohan’s Beach Club, broadcast in 2019, about her plan to manage a beach bar in Greece.

"393 ","No Man’s Land review – well-meaning drama about US-Mexico relations                           ","Just north of the border between the United States and Mexico, the Greer family – patriarch Bill (Frank Grillo), mom Monica (Andie MacDowell), and grown sons Lucas (Alex MacNicoll) and Jackson (Jake Allyn) – work the land as ranchers. They raise cattle, ride horses and, being red-blooded Texan types, play sports – in Jackson’s case well enough that he’s got a chance to go pro as a baseball player. They also spend the odd evening riding the range with a vigilante militia group, rounding up immigrants who may have crossed the border illegally, to “help” the border patrols. On one such night, Jackson joins his dad and big brother, even though they try to keep him out of this sort of thing so he can get out of Dodge and become a sports hero – and what do you know, the dumb lug ends up shooting and killing a boy (Alessio Valentini) just a little younger than himself. In the back no less. Ashamed, distraught and worried that his father will try to take the rap for him, Jackson confesses to local Texas Ranger Ramirez (venerable character actor George Lopez), but then bolts across the border to Mexico on his trusty horse Sundance. Soon, the fugitive is learning some life lessons and about what Mexico is really like, and he becomes a hired hand for a nice middle-class family. A flirtatious friendship blooms between him and the family’s pretty daughter, Victoria (Esmeralda Pimentel), while he tries not to get caught by the dead kid’s dad Gustavo (Jorge A Jimenez) and a skeevy people-trafficking “coyote” (Andres Delgado), who are out to get him. This is clearly a well-intentioned film and not as entirely focused on the moral education of a gringo as the above would suggest; a lot of screen time is taken up with Gustavo’s own ethical crisis. However, the script – credited to the star Jake Allyn, his director brother Conor and a third Allyn named Rob, as well as Joel Shapiro – is as on the nose as a didactic punch to the face. But as contemporary westerns go, this one is at least nice to look at, with the endless shots of landscapes at magic hour. • No Man’s Land is released on 31 May on digital platforms.",No Man’s Land,FILM
"394 ","Elyse review – Anthony Hopkins turns psychiatrist in portrait of a troubled woman             ","This peculiar, freakishly uneven but far from meritless psychological drama stars Lisa Pepper as the title character, a soigné but very intense woman in early middle age who seems both on the verge of nervous breakdown and under the influence of some kind of emotional malady. Elyse is married to Stephen Bridges (Aaron Tucker), a successful lawyer, and they have a young son (Griffin Thomas Hollander); the boy is largely looked after by the family’s housekeeper Julia (Julieta Ortiz) while Elyse drifts about through her day, browsing at bookshops, stroking donuts she doesn’t eat, all the while carrying a camera she barely uses even though she’s meant to be a photographer of some sort. But the placid surface of this Los Angeleno style-magazine existence is suddenly broken by violent eruptions of temper from Elyse, directed mostly at Julia’s daughter Carmen (Tara Arroyave), who also lives with the Bridges and works for Stephen as an intern, as well as Elyse’s own mother Goldie (Fran Tucker), who Elyse accuses of plotting against her. Eventually, they manage to persuade Elyse to see a psychiatrist, Dr Lewis (Anthony Hopkins), and some clues as to what’s really going on begin to emerge. Suffice it to say that in a strange way this film is something of a gender-flipped companion piece to The Father, for which Hopkins just won an Oscar – only this time he’s a supporting character instead of the protagonist. Unfortunately director Stella Hopkins, who also co-wrote the film with Audrey Arkins, doesn’t have comparable directorial skill to The Father’s Florian Zeller. The tonal shifts flicker like a strobe light, while the mannered use of black and white, with a later shift to full colour, comes across as pretentious and literal rather than evocative of the character’s inner state. And despite the fact that she’s married to Hopkins, Stella Hopkins seems to struggle with getting the best out of the other actors in her cast, whose performances range from the merely stiff to painfully hammy and embarrassing and back to just inept. Lead actor Pepper’s work runs the full gamut, even going so far as to be outright excellent in later scenes when her character is at her lowest ebb. The final reveal is so melodramatic and excessive it is faintly ridiculous, but there’s still a nugget of real emotional truth here in the film’s portrait of trauma and depression. • Elyse is released on 31 May on digital platforms.",Elyse,FILM
"395 ","Dinner in America review – quirky couple take a trip through suburbia                         ","“Is weird cool?” “In your case, no.” This pert exchange summarises the style of writer-director Adam Rehmeier’s indie dramedy, with two very good lead performers whose unexpected chemistry gradually makes this film likable. It’s about an angry punk singer with a pyromania fetish and a lonely and nerdy young woman with ADHD who is his biggest fan. Kyle Gallner plays John Q Public (real name: Simon), the lead singer of a band called Psy Ops who performs anonymously in a balaclava; off-stage, he has a vocal-fry badass voice, like Ray Liotta in GoodFellas. Simon is experiencing furious musical differences with the rest of the band and is making money through selling weed and taking part in big pharma medical experiments. Emily Skeggs is excellent as quirky, dreamy Patty, who takes indistinct Polaroids of herself masturbating to his music in her childhood bedroom and sends them to him via the mailbox address on the band’s flyers. But, when Simon gets into trouble after setting something on fire, Patty shields him from the police, never dreaming that he is the object of her self-pleasuring fan correspondence; meanwhile, he has no idea that this irritating dork has been sending him the (rather gratifying) photos. Soon the pair are getting into criminal scrapes together, like a low-rent Bonnie and Clyde who never actually travel anywhere. Simon’s most famous song, evidently, is something called Dinner in America, and this film proceeds in a series of three desperately uncomfortable middle-class family dinners with three different families, Simon being a smouldering guest at each. The “dinner table scene with sulky kids” scene is a staple of US indie movies satirising suburban ennui, and this could have been a cliche. But Rehmeier creates something amusing and offbeat in each one, and Pat Healy and Mary Lynn Rajskub are entertaining as Patty’s uptight parents. Twenty years ago, Sam Mendes’s American Beauty and Todd Solondz’s Happiness were at opposite ends of the spectrum of difficult weirdness for this kind of material, Solondz setting a gold standard for strangeness, dysfunction and discomfort. Rehmeier is at the American Beauty end of things. His film has its own truculent charm. • Dinner in America is released on digital platforms on 1 June.",Dinner in America,FILM
"396 ","Demon Slayer the Movie: Mugen Train review – an anime fever dream                             ","If, like me, you have not watched the hit 2019 Japanese TV series Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, let alone read the manga series it was based on, then you may struggle somewhat to understand exactly what’s going on in this feature-length instalment in the saga. But even if you don’t dive into Google to work out the backstory, it’s not that hard get the hang of; or at least who are the slayers and who are the demons. The good guy slayers have huge eyes, albeit ones with weird polygonal shapes and strangely coloured irises, while the evil demons often have kanji characters where their pupils should be, as well as shapeshifting abilities. The latter also have hard-to-define but distinctly “villainous” voices, while the good guys tend to speak in a staccato, declamatory fashion, prone to awkward enunciations such as: “While this our first time meeting, I already dislike you.” Either way, the animation is fantastic, a superb blend of classic anime character design supplemented by CGI effects and swooping camera work. The action, like South Korean features Snowpiercer or Train to Busan, takes place mostly on a train where the demon slayers – brunette, magenta-eyed hero Tanjiro Kamado, his tame demon sister Nezuko, blond pretty boy Zenitsu Agatsuma and shouty half-man-half-boar Inosuke Hashibira – come to find a slaying master Kyojuro, who has unique fire-adjacent properties. But just as the ensemble are getting to know each other, they are sent into sleep comas by a powerful demon and his bewitched child demons. In his dreams, Tanjiro meets his family once again – the ones who were killed by demons in the TV series – and the others have similar reveries, compelling them to decide which reality they want to live in. Squint a bit, relax your mind and you might find in it a touching allegory that accidentally corresponds to our own, collective emergence from the oneiric, mesmeric lull of lockdown life, in which sleeping too much and dreaming about dead loved ones could have become the new going out. • Demon Slayer the Movie: Mugen Train is released on 26 May in cinemas.",Demon Slayer the Movie: Mugen Train,FILM
"397 ","Bank Job review – a classic ‘print money to cancel debt’ caper                                ","Not to be confused with the Jason Statham heist caper, here’s a likable documentary with a big heart and some punch-the-air moments from husband and wife team Hilary Powell and Daniel Edelstyn. The film is the story of how they opened a “bank” on their high street in Walthamstow, north-east London, and printed money – a kind of art-installation-meets-community-activism project. On the banknotes they replaced the Queen’s head with portraits of local heroes: a food bank founder on the fiver; a soup kitchen volunteer on the tenner; a youth leader on the 20; a primary school headteacher on the 50. The project was inspired by the Rolling Jubilee Fund in America, which bought $3.8m worth of students’ loans in 2014 and cancelled the debt. So, with the £40,000 raised from selling their art banknotes, Powell and Edelstyn spent half buying back £1.2m of debt owed by ordinary people in Walthamstow. (It cost so little because debt is sold for significantly less on the secondary market because it’s unlikely all of it will be paid back). In a lovely scene they print letters to inform people that their debts have been paid off – posting them in nice expensive envelopes, not official-looking A4 ones with windows, which might put off the recipients from opening them. The other £20,000 was donated to the causes that feature on the banknotes. Sweetly, the pair have kept in their bickering, and financial experts chip in to explain the rise of toxic debt culture. The film ends with Powell and Edelstyn blowing up a gold Ford Transit van full of “money” across the river from Canary Wharf, notes fluttering in the breeze – a symbolic gesture and homage to The Italian Job; though sadly they don’t manage to blow the bloody doors off. • Bank Job is released on 28 May in cinemas.",Bank Job,FILM

"400 ","Skull: The Mask review – a masterclass in over-the-top butchery                               ","Anyone who wanted more of the human-sacrifice scene in Mel Gibson’s Apocalypto will be overjoyed by this silly, uneven but strangely appealing slasher film that leaves no heart unripped from human thorax. A mystifying prologue sees Nazis unearth a grotesque pre-Colombian skull mask, which looks like Darth Maul’s Sunday best. The artefact resurfaces in modern-day São Paulo where, after chewing up the archaeologist who found it, it attaches itself to one of the crime-scene cleaners. He is transformed into a host for Anhangá, an indigenous demon who loves an old-school blood sacrifice. Here’s hoping the actor in the mask (Brazilian wrestler Rurik Jr) didn’t make any earnest thespian inquiries about Anhangá’s motivation, because this is a tough one to answer. It’s hinted he’s on a lumbering journey towards a church where a rival god’s femur is kept; Manco (Wilton Andrade) – a fruit-seller who is also part of some ancient order – is determined to intervene. Also following the entrails is detective Beatriz (Natallia Rodrigues), who is blackmailed into cooperating with a gaunt corporate CEO (Ivo Müller) planning to use the mask in a ritual involving abducted Bolivian children. By the time Anhangá is making carpaccio of a nightclub full of ravers, it’s clear his motivation is really to provide steady employment for Brazil’s practical-effects artists. This, in fact, is co-director Kapel Furman’s background – and, from scooped-out torsos to the vine-like appendages writhing around the killer’s body, he undeniably delivers. The profusion of plot strands is almost as messy as the omnipresent innards – and any intended social comment about the influence of Brazilian plutocrats gets lost down there. But, while it lacks focus, there’s a rude vigour about Skull: The Mask, which has as many passages of exciting film-making as amateurish ones. The exploitation film-style prologue suggests Machete on a South American holiday, and the directors use drones and digital shooting to skilfully scope out the concrete spaces of the climax. The butchery is interspersed with eerie inserts – blood welling up inside a chalice, for example – that grasp at a more mystical tone than elsewhere.

"401 ","Zebra Girl review – cartoon murder splices iffily with other serious issues                   ","This low-budget indie set in the dark heart of the rural English suburbs begins with a woman plunging an eight-inch kitchen knife into her husband’s head. The tone that director Stephanie Zari is going for seems to be that blend of violence and black humour that Fargo and Killing Eve make look so easy. But Zebra Girl’s quirky comedy is not quite distinctive enough, and the script lurches iffily into serious issues of child abuse and mental illness in the second half. Sarah Roy plays the murderer, Catherine, who grabs a knife from the cutlery drawer after catching husband Dan (Tom Cullen) watching unpleasant porn at 3am in the study of their country pile. A shrieky horror movie score blares as she does the deed and afterwards she wraps a fluffy pink towel around his head. The next morning, she calls in childhood friend Anita (Jade Anouka), who is shocked – but not exactly surprised – to walk in on a murder scene. It turns out that Catherine’s plummily posh private school accent and Tory chic fashion taste (pink cashmere knits and pearl earrings) are an affectation. What’s also clear is that she’s a psychopath without a trace of conscience. “Help me bag this bastard up,” she snaps at Anita. Even with the deadpan one-liners she’s not an interesting or layered character. In flashback we see Catherine and university lecturer Dan meet and fall in love. On their first date she is manic and awkward, telling him about her dark past. He’s taken aback, but not put off. “You were a national story,” he marvels. That past emerges in flashback, too, in scenes showing Catherine as a little girl (played Daisy Mayer), then as precocious teenager (Isabelle Connolly) being questioned at a police station. For me, the cartoonish violence and flippancy of the adult bit belongs to a different film from some of the upsetting episodes elsewhere. • Zebra Girl is in cinemas from 28 May.",Zebra Girl,FILM
"402 ","Granada Nights review – voyage of heartbreak and self-discovery in Spain’s deep south         ","The premise of Granada Nights, the directorial debut from Abid Khan, seems promising enough, in that it reimagines the tired subgenre of a sad white guy going to a foreign country and learning how to live, love and laugh. Unfortunately, while refreshingly centring a British Asian protagonist, Khan’s film is hopelessly bogged down by a thin plot and cliched dialogues. Square, Instagram-like framing opens this journey of self-discovery, capturing reserved 24-year-old Ben (Antonio Aakeel) en route from London to Granada, Spain, to surprise his long-distance girlfriend, Helen. The tight composition oozes anxiety, and Ben’s apprehensions are sadly proved right: Helen doesn’t even want to see his face. Heartbroken and sneering at hostels, Ben is persuaded by spunky backpacker Amelia (Quintessa Swindell) to stay and explore the city. One night turns into weeks and months as the formerly shy guy gets immersed in the buzzing international student scene. The aspect ratios gradually expand – reminiscent of Xavier Dolan’s Mommy – as the framing mirrors Ben’s newly acquired open-mindedness and inner peace. Despite these ambitious stylistic flourishes, Granada Nights remains a frustrating watch. The gap is too apparent between what the film wants to be – a Richard Linklater-esque European wandering – and what the film actually is. Some of the writing is glaringly weak, especially in the first half where every line sounds like a contrived inspirational quote. As a result, this is at its best when there is no dialogue, and the camera simply follows Ben through the beautiful, ancient streets. The city comes alive then, but the drunken indoor student parties overshadow outdoor sequences. Considering the script is based on Khan’s own experience during a sabbatical in Spain, it is a shame that such personal healing should transfer so blandly to screen. However, in a post-Brexit world, the film and its host of international characters will certainly make audience pine for the once robust Erasmus programme. • Granada Nights is released in cinemas on 28 May.",Granada Nights,FILM
"403 ","Cruella review – Emma Stone is a joy as the refashioned supervillain                          ","In 1996’s 101 Dalmatians, Glenn Close’s gleefully unhinged performance as a puppy-skinning fashion designer riffed on older audience members’ prior knowledge of the actor as a “bunny boiler” in Fatal Attraction. Emma Stone’s Cruella de Vil is much more grounded and thus not as camp, a supervillain with a believable backstory – born Estella, bullied by boys at school and established as a maverick who’s always refused to “follow the pattern” (as her single mother puts it) in both dressmaking and in life. Set in 1970s London against a backdrop of the emerging punk scene, this playful prequel by Craig Gillespie (I, Tonya) is a fine feat of world-building. Like Phantom Thread or Marie Antoinette, it’s also an excellent fashion film, playing on the myth of the egocentric, detail-oriented genius. One of its main narrative threads involves Estella’s apprenticeship at, and eventual sabotage of, a couture fashion house headed by an icy narcissist named The Baroness (Emma Thompson, exuding Meryl Streep’s energy in The Devil Wears Prada). Fashion enthusiasts may also draw connections between the House of Baroness’s sculptural, Dior-esque gowns and Estella’s Alexander McQueen-influenced lace and leather looks (McQueen, of course, succeeded John Galliano at Givenchy in the 90s when the latter moved to Dior). There is even a reference to McQueen’s 2011 monarch butterfly dress. The film is structured as a family-friendly heist movie that plays out against a series of costume balls. There’s probably one act too many and so the pacing suffers; younger children with shorter attention spans might, too. Still, Stone is a joy: vampy, sneering and as eager to please as a dalmatian.",Cruella,FILM
"404 ","I Used to Be Normal: A Boyband Fangirl Story review – tears, squeals and boundless devotion","Unless you’ve experienced boyband fandom, it can be difficult to square the contrivance of commercial PG pop acts with the overwhelming, boundless, alchemic devotion felt by their teenage fans. The cultural default is to deride, dismiss and pathologise teenage girls undone by fandom (see, a century before boybands, Lisztomania). In sharp contrast is I Used to Be Normal: A Boyband Fangirl Story, Australian film-maker Jessica Leski’s generous, observational documentary of boyband obsession across four pop generations. The film takes its title from a tearful lament by then 16-year-old Elif, a One Direction superfan in New York, in a viral YouTube video of her melting into tears/panic/excitement at the idea of meeting the band’s Niall Horan. At school and in the clip, Elif is chastised (by herself among others) for her deeply unchill display of feeling. But the 90-minute documentary subtly skewers that idea of normal. Leski smartly understands that fandom is not so much a condition as a portal for universal teenage emotions: a transformative experience of coming into your own, of feeling alive and seen. The film offers a breezy skim through this phenomenon; the bulk of the footage is just listening, in first-person testimonials, to four personal experiences. Dara, a 33-year-old Take That diehard in Australia, provides a succinct overview of the genre’s defining characteristics (three to five band members, categorisable personas, lovelorn lyrics, no mention of sex). Susan, 64, also Australian, recalls Beatledom in the early 60s as an evergreen, unmatchable catharsis. Elif and 25-year-old Sadia, a Backstreet Boys devotee, discuss how online fan communities both alienated them from immigrant parents and helped soothe feelings of unbelonging in the US. More uncomfortable images of gawking or obsession – no-longer-teenage fans, for example, following Nick Carter on a Backstreet Boys cruise like camera-laden hyenas to a gazelle – are unprocessed, as Leski never presses into discomfort or shame harder than the subjects themselves. The film also sidesteps fandom’s potential for toxicity, especially on social media. I Used to Be Normal feels like a balm to anyone who’s watched a music video and fallen into hours of yearning – an experience that is quite normal and even, years later, still formative and viscerally real. • I Used to Be Normal: A Boyband Fangirl Story is released on 31 May on digital platforms.",I Used to Be Normal: A Boyband Fangirl Story,FILM

With her grumpy expression, mismatched socks and pigtails pricked up like antennae, enterprising orphan Earwig (dubbed by Taylor Henderson) is a cute enough creation, but there’s neither believable camaraderie between her and Dan Stevens’s rangy and taciturn black cat, nor sufficient antagonism between her and the blue-haired witch (Vanessa Marshall) who “adopts” and imprisons her. Everything moves a little too slowly, not least the shuffling animation. For a film about magic, there’s little sparkle to spare.",Earwig and the Witch,FILM
"406 ","Frankie review – trouble in a Portuguese paradise with Isabelle Huppert                       ","The famously stylish Isabelle Huppert spends a stretch of this handsome drama on her hands and knees. In the verdant foothills of Sintra, Portugal, ailing actor Frankie (Huppert) searches for the €40,000 bracelet her only son, Paul (Jérémie Renier), has tossed into the woods, rejecting her offer of a valuable family heirloom that could be cashed in after her death. It’s that kind of film – one in which depressed rich people go on holiday to argue about death, inheritance tax, diamond jewellery and their deteriorating marriages. The approach taken by director Ira Sachs (Love Is Strange) is utterly sincere and so utterly humourless, though the performances are quietly compelling; Marissa Tomei brings a liquid warmth as Frankie’s American friend Ilene. Sachs plays on Huppert’s queenly presence too. It’s fitting that she gathers her nearest and dearest in a town that was once a sanctuary for the Portuguese nobility.",Frankie,FILM
"407 ","Surge review – Ben Whishaw shines as a man unravelling                                        ","Ben Whishaw’s Joseph is an airport security worker at Stansted. His job involves giving humiliating pat-downs, his home life consists of lonely TV dinners in his Tottenham flat and now, visiting his parents, he can’t even drink a glass of water without being criticised. “You swallow so loudly, Joseph,” complains his mother (Ellie Haddington). No wonder his composure shatters (along with the glass), an incident that sets off a spree of increasingly chaotic behaviour. The frequently handheld camera keeps pace with Joseph’s frenetic energy as he robs a bank and later, in one astonishing scene, rips up a hotel mattress. Assisted by co-writer Rita Kalnejais (Babyteeth), British writer-director Aneil Karia’s debut feature draws from his 2013 short, Beat, which also starred Whishaw as a man propelled by unseen forces. Whishaw’s intensity is gripping to watch but the character remains opaque; whether we’re meant to read Joseph as experiencing psychosis or simply suffering the unforgiving conditions of city life under capitalism is ambiguous.",Surge,FILM

A throwback to the brightly coloured offbeat teen movies of the 90s and a rude riposte to that era’s more mainstream offerings (She’s All That’s sexist makeover scene is subverted), this sweet romcom is buoyed up by the chemistry between its leads. Tender moments, such as an original song penned by Patty, are tempered by the film’s abrasive and often scatological sense of humour.",Dinner in America,FILM
"409 ","Vanquish review – Ruby Rose slugs it out on a motorbike                                       ","With the superhero’s gentrification of the blockbuster business, there is little space any more for big-budget original action movies. So up-and-comers such as Ruby Rose – seen earlier this year opposite Jean Reno in The Doorman – are forced to slug it out in the B-movie arena, from where there’s no guarantee they’ll ever emerge into stardom. Rose looks great – her androgynous poise reminiscent of the young Angelina Jolie – and does a capable job carrying Vanquish. But you wonder if this noir-filtered, John Wick-apeing thriller is a little too stripped-back for its own good to advance her career. Rose plays Victoria, carer to Damon (Morgan Freeman), a wheelchair-bound retired cop whose ridiculously upscale mansion hints at off-the-books income. But she has a secret past, too: as a top drug courier in Berlin for the Russian mafia. So when Damon decides to call in money from his narcotics contacts, he forces Victoria to make the five stops necessary – and takes her daughter hostage as insurance. The alpha mama takes to her superbike for a whistlestop underworld tour, strapped up with a helmet and chestcam letting her blackmailer eyeball her rendezvous. Rose’s cartoonish assignations (some homeboys, a priest, a big-mouth mustachioed dealer in the mould of Alfred Molina in Boogie Nights), coupled with a scattering of plot morsels, give just enough narrative momentum to get Vanquish over the line. Director George Gallo is oddly relaxed about the finer details – such as how his heroine manages, held at gunpoint, to remove a hand grenade from her jacket, detonate it and escape unharmed – but he does have a talent for general ambience. Rose has an entrancingly tense entrance when she walks in on an African American gang as they watch an unlikely combination of curling and soft porn on giant screens. But the in-camera gimmick, with Freeman literally phoning it in on Rose’s headset, lends a strangely passive, vicarious overlay to much of the action – which is not particularly well-marshalled. There is no John Wick-style long-take high-wire act here – it’s simpler just to make Rose so deadly she never misses a headshot. Speaking of careers, this listless fodder is not where you’d have predicted Gallo, writer of 80s masterpiece Midnight Run, to end up. • Vanquish is available online on 28 May.",Vanquish,FILM
"410 ","Flashback review – confusing but compelling multiverse thriller                               ","If Slaughterhouse-Five and Donnie Darko had a baby, and that baby grew up in the 2000s, became a teenager and then developed a bit of a substance abuse problem, went partying with Denis Villeneuve’s Enemy and that Ashton Kutcher movie The Butterfly Effect, developed memory loss and depression, then it might look something like this interesting but rather muddled Canadian science fiction film. Dylan O’Brien, an actor in his late 20s who is fortuitously baby-faced enough to be cast as a high-school senior, stars as Fred, a guy who seems to have come a bit unstuck in time. At first, things seem normal as he goes about his life as an IT office drone, working under tough boss Evelyn (Amanda Brugel, looking more glam here than she usually does in The Handmaid’s Tale) and living with his nice but somewhat dull partner Karen (Hannah Gross). But the increasing dementia of his mother (Liisa Repo-Martell) and memories triggered by old photographs gets Fred thinking about his wild teenage years. Back then, Fred and his buddies did a faddish drug called Mercury, and Fred was crushing on an emo girl named Cindy (Maika Monroe from It Follows) who sat in front of him in maths class. But what seem at first like, per the film’s title, flashbacks turn out to be moments Fred is living in simultaneously. Or maybe they are another type of flashback: hallucinations induced by Mercury. Either way, these visual fragments start to piece together, quite literally, in a near-blur of superfast edits and the nature of Fred’s reality becomes a little clearer. Some viewers may need a second screening or more to work out what the hell is actually going on, especially with the EDM playing in the background in some scenes. Nevertheless, this pulpy multiverse brain-teaser is reasonably compelling to watch – at least in this reality. In another, it’s straight to video garbage, and in yet another, it’s won the Palme d’Or. • Flashback is released on 4 June on digital platforms.",Flashback,FILM
"411 ","Brighton review – Steven Berkoff’s dated seaside satire is a washout                          ","The subject of this four-hander by the seaside is the changing face of Britishness. But Stephen Cookson’s film, adapted from Steven Berkoff’s 1994 play Brighton Beach Scumbags, is marooned in a weird cultural no man’s land. Maybe its four characters – Dinah and Derek, Dave and Doreen, a brace of ageing teddy boy/girl couples on a potty-mouthed nostalgia trip to the town where they met – qualified as bleeding-edge social satire in the 90s. But in an age of inquisitional identity politics, railing against “Pakis” and “poofters”, they stand out as cancellation candidates. Even for 2005, the year to which the film is updated, it seems archaic. It’s an awkward compromise, but setting it in the present day would have meant a heavy rewrite to make these throwbacks the Ukip voters they surely would be. Brighton takes place largely in a set of deckchairs on the seafront, like a Beryl Cook painting come to life. As the diehards chow down on burgers in closeup, Cookson lets us gorge on reams of heavily salted cockney dialogue. This grotesquerie is undeniably a great British tradition – but it’s hard to know who would revel in these caricatures today. Not fully updated in the light of 21st-century Britain, lacking the deadly irony with which Mike Leigh often shivs his characters, they feel like sour relics, even post-Brexit. The film tries to distance itself from their fag-toting antediluvianism with a couple of unconvincing plot twists. It comes over as too little too late, after indulging them for over an hour. Apart from the 60s flashbacks and the odd cutaway to a glittering English Channel, Cookson does little to disguise Brighton’s stage origins. At least, given this inertness, it is strongly performed by the four stalwarts. Larry Lamb – once of the EastEnders parish – plays Derek with an eroded remnant of his teddy quiff; a gammon-visaged Phil Davis is the butt of everyone’s jokes as Dave; Marion Bailey bustles terrifically through Dinah’s anxiety; and Lesley Sharp’s Doreen is the one character permitted real depth. The four Ds get their trailer moment with an impromptu waltz to I’m Forever Blowing Bubbles. It’s that kind of carry-on. • Brighton is released on digital platforms on 7 June.",Brighton,FILM
"412 ","I Am Samuel review – meditative, optimistic documentary on queer love in Kenya ","Filmed over five years, this documentary, directed by Peter Murimi, opens on a striking note that contrasts intimacy with cruelty. A date between Sam, the film’s subject, and his boyfriend Alex is juxtaposed with the brutal footage of a violent attack on one of Murimi’s own friends. Witnessing the tender connection between the couple in a society where people in such relationships can undergo physical harm as well as legal punishment affirms the courageous, moving joy of queer love and the bravery of the men who participate in the documentary. Having grown up in a small Kenyan village, Sam struggles with his sexuality until he moves to Nairobi, where he finds romance and acceptance. The bustling city might seem claustrophobic, with its rows of cramped apartments, yet introspective moments, captured by shots of laundry hung on balconies, gently rustling in the wind, offer breathing spaces. Back on the farm, Sam’s traditional, religious parents – his taciturn father is a Christian preacher – welcome Alex’s visits but still nudge their son to get married. The dynamic shifts when Sam finally comes out to his family. Sam is quiet on screen, so this film focuses on the rhythm of his private life: small gestures, such as when he kneads dough to make flatbreads or removes the kernels from his parents’ corn. This subdued approach poignantly conveys resilience; a harrowing attack aimed at Sam (and suffered by his roommate) is recalled by the victim in a matter-of-fact way. The fact that Murimi doesn’t sensationalise acts of discrimination only emphasises how painfully commonplace violence is in Kenya, but also suggests how queer solidarity and support are a crucial part of that same reality. The film is perhaps over compact, but its ending is heartwarmingly optimistic. • I Am Samuel is digital platforms from 3 June.",I Am Samuel,FILM
"413 ","Caveat review – give that creepy mechanical bunny a Bafta!                                    ","This first feature from writer-director-editor Damian McCarthy sounds like it’s been assembled from off-the-shelf horror movie components: a protagonist with amnesia, missing people, a maybe-haunted house on an island (with a basement!), a creepy toy animal, and flashbacks that require the viewer to keep track of hairstyles and beard lengths to tell where we are in the timeline. But McCarthy plays a fancy cinematic game of hide the lady, swishing the narrative cards around adeptly and finding fresh ways to imbue the material with an incrementally increasing sense of unease. Props are particularly due to the props department, or whoever was responsible for the design of the mechanical drumming rabbit toy that plays a key role – a creature with human-looking glass eyes that glare out from a beetled brow with a calibrated expression of wariness, aggression and complicity. Give that bunny a Bafta! Its co-star is Jonathan French, who plays Isaac, an amnesiac young man with an impressive red beard, hired by a stranger named Barret (Ben Caplan) to “babysit” his niece. This is Olga (Leila Sykes), a young woman prone to fits of catatonia and running off to stay in the house where her father, Barret’s brother, killed himself some time ago, not long after his wife went missing. Most people would be wary of any job offer, no matter how remunerative, under just those conditions, but the weirdest part is that Isaac has to wear a leather harness, attached by lock and key to a long chain anchored in the basement, because Olga, when not in a catatonic state, is terrified of men. Nevertheless, Isaac takes the job, and soon finds himself clanking about the building, peeping through roughly sawn holes in the wall, his face lit like Anthony Perkins in Psycho, and being freaked out by a painting that keeps falling down and changing its image when he’s not looking. The painting could be a metonym for the film itself, which seems to shapeshift under the viewer’s gaze. The effect is both modern in its oblique surrealism but also reminiscent of silent cinema. The final endgame is a little unsatisfying, but this is a very interesting debut for McCarthy. • Caveat is released on 3 June on Shudder.",Caveat,FILM
"414 ","Safe Inside review – a flawed thriller with a doozy of a twist                                ","Ana (Andrea Tivadar) and her boyfriend Tom (Tom Ainsley) are Americans travelling around Europe, who take a coach to a rural part of France where they expect to do farm work for a landowner, Richard (Steven Brand). The coach is involved in an accident, and when the two wake up everyone is gone, so they walk the rest of the way to Richard’s mansion. But Tom doesn’t get on so well with the landlord, and there’s something weird about the books in the house and records on the shelves. Everything is just a tiny bit skewwhiff in this intriguing but flawed thriller, starting with the fact that although it’s supposed to be set somewhere near Provence’s lavender fields and about two Yanks, director Renata Gabryjelska is Polish, Tivadar is British-Romanian, and the rest of the actors are mostly either Brits or Poles trying to sound French. Apart, that is, from the magnificent Joanna Kulig, star of Paweł Pawlikowski’s Cold War, who is largely wasted in a small role here. It was actually shot in Poland, which is why the architecture doesn’t look much like France at all. But it turns out everything makes sense in a way when the big twist kicks in, a real doozy that would be unfair to spoil. Unfortunately, that makes it very tricky to explain why the film doesn’t quite work. Basically, let’s say that the science part, on which the twist depends, is very tenuous indeed. And the script, by Błażej Dzikowski, based on an idea by Gabryjelska, isn’t nimble enough to dance around these core implausibilities. At least the cast is toothsome and pleasant to watch, especially Tivadar. • Safe Inside is released on 7 June on digital platforms.",Safe Inside,FILM
"415 ","Knots: A Forced Marriage Story review – bleak overview of marital coercion in America         ","There’s no rosy nostalgia to the wedding photos featured in Knots: A Forced Marriage Story, a 75-minute documentary written and directed by Kate Ryan Brewer that calls attention to the disturbingly few barriers against coerced marriage in the US. In succinct and gnawing first-person interviews, three women detail how intense parental pressure, teenage gullibility and isolation forced them into marriage with people they barely knew. There’s Nina van Harn, raised in the fundamentalist Christian patriarchy movement in rural western Michigan and married at 19 to a man selected by her father; Sara Tasneem, married at 15 to a 28-year-old stranger by her father; and Fraidy Reiss, paired by an Orthodox Jewish matchmaker in Brooklyn at 19. Along with the three women’s personal testimonies of coercion, confusion, shattered breaking points and eventual escape (all through arduous divorce proceedings), Knots weaves in bits of legal and historical context for a deeply troubling portrait of archaic marriage laws in the US. As the film points out, 48 states allow marriage for those under 18 through various exceptions, while 13 states have no age minimums for marriage at all. It’s a bleak picture, enhanced by Miriam Mayer’s spare, ominous score and recurring shots of a stirring dance performance by Bella Waru. Both gesture to the desperation, fear and anguish felt by the narrators, especially in regards to sexual trauma, which is referred to openly but not discussed in great detail. The spectre of coerced consummation is harrowing enough; Sara, at 15, was so unaware of what marriage entailed that she remembers asking her adult escorts to the wedding where she’d be sleeping that night. Knots is a straightforward advocacy film, and that’s fine: you don’t need cinematic bells and whistles to marvel at the women’s astounding resilience, or writhe at the gaslighting lines about honour, duty, and respect they were fed for years. There’s little faith to be found in the US political system, which has been slow to enact child marriage protections, but Knots offers three testaments to the human spirit, and the ability to start anew. • Knots: A Forced Marriage Story is released on 4 June on digital platforms.",Knots: A Forced Marriage Story,FILM
"416 ","Felix and the Hidden Treasure – family animation flounders as satire                          ","This is a semi-entertaining, reasonably decent family animation that begins promisingly with a swell of adventure as a young boy sets sail in a boat in search of his missing dad. But after a couple of hastily resolved peril-at-sea moments (“We’re done for! We’re saved!”) the script lurches into a bizarrely un-childfriendly storyline about a secretive cult. The boy is 12-year-old Felix (nicely voiced by Daniel Brochu), who lives in Quebec’s Magdalen Islands with his mum and little sister. Two years earlier, his fisherman dad was lost at sea. Any hope that he might be alive is long gone, but Felix is determined to search the island where he was last spotted. He ropes in grumpy lighthouse-keeper Tom to help – a real old Captain Birdseye with a bushy beard and eyebrows like furry white caterpillars. There are some gracefully animated scenes as the pair sail off, all glowing sunsets and churning waves. But when they get shipwrecked, it all goes headspinningly wrong. They discover that an evil cult has built an underground city on the island where Felix’s dad went missing. The group’s leader Morgäa (Karine Vanasse), a woman with flicky, over-the-top Real Housewives hair and bling sunglasses, rejects the label “cult”. “The residents come here entirely of their own accord,” she trills. “They’ve adopted a peaceful, sincere lifestyle based on principles of harmony.” This satire of lifestyle gurus here is pretty low on gags, and it’s hard to see how it will connect with younger viewers. The rest of the movie plays out in standard kids’ entertainment frantic mode, the group’s security beefcakes chasing Felix and Tom around, everyone bopping each other on the head. Spoiler alert: Morgäa’s power is linked to immortality; adults get turned into babies, kids are threatened with premature ageing. It’s a neat idea, but the script doesn’t take it anywhere interesting. • Felix and the Hidden Treasure is released on 4 June in cinemas.",Felix and the Hidden Treasure,FILM
"417 ","Lupin III: The First review – spectacular return for the legendary gentleman thief            ","Lupin, the legendary gentleman thief who jumped from the pages of the original Monkey Punch manga to numerous animated features and TV series, not to mention music CDs and video games, returns to the screen in the first iteration of the character in CG animation. This is a family-friendly interpretation from writer/director Takashi Yamazaki, sidestepping the raunchiness of some other adaptations, though retaining a heroic, cheeky and charming flair. This time around, the adventure of the daredevil thief is a little thin in terms of plot, yet dazzling in its execution. A decade after the end of the second world war, Lupin attempts to steal a diary containing secret inventions that caused its owner, the famous archeologist Bresson, to be shot dead by Nazis. During his quest, Lupin crosses path with Laetitia, an archeology student who is after the treasured item on behalf of her adopted grandfather; she is unaware that the latter is a Nazi sympathiser. When her eyes are opened to the old man’s nefarious intentions, she joins forces with Lupin and his sidekicks Jigen and Goemon, to stop the evil Nazis from securing Bresson’s all-powerful machine. As the film leaps across numerous continents, the gorgeous animation is on full display, capturing the striking hues of dusk hitting the Parisian rooftops as brilliantly as the sandy highlands in Mexico. Lupin III: The First stays true to the spirit of earlier anime renditions while showcasing the distinctive 3D look of CG animation; the spectacular sequence where Lupin zips through deadly laser rays while Yuji Ohno’s classic theme jazzily swells will impress even the most ardent of fans. Forgettable story aside, the film is a visual treat, full of joy and zaniness. • Lupin III: The First is released on 2 June in cinemas.",Lupin III: The First,FILM

"419 ","Life in a Year review – Cara Delevingne and Jaden Smith in vacuous cancer weepie              ","“I don’t believe in happy endings,” Cara Delevingne shouts at Jaden Smith in this gushing, sobfest cancer romance. She plays Izzy, a Pittsburgh teenager diagnosed with stage three ovarian cancer and given less than a year to live. Izzy is a character you might recognise from other movies: the pretty cancer-patient girlfriend. Her job here is to be life-affirmingly brave and then die (tastefully), thus enriching her boyfriend Daryn (Smith) with a tragic yet alluring backstory. Which is a shame, because Delevingne gives an impressive performance; not convincing exactly, but likable and charismatic. And to be fair, Izzy is a paper-thin character – on paper, she must have looked like a collection of cliches. Izzy grows up on the wrong side of town, raised from the age of six by the babysitter after her drug-addict mum walked out. She’s tattooed and tough on the outside, with blue hair, and a sweet-natured and courageous soul. Smith, on the other hand, is a tad bland as rich kid Daryn, an outstanding student being groomed for greatness by his dad (Cuba Gooding Jr). Secretly, Daryn dreams of becoming a rapper; and here’s where Izzy comes in useful with her grab-life-while-you-can dying-girl wisdom. The pair meet when they both gatecrash a rap gig. Izzy nicknames Daryn “Square”. The blue hair turns out to be a wig: she lost her hair during chemo. When he finds out she’s dying, Daryn decides to cram a lifetime of milestones into their short year together. The upbeat montages of the two seizing the day and the slo-mo panic dashes to A&amp;E feel like scenes shuffled from a dozen terminal-illness weepies. Depressingly, Izzy seems to have absolutely no friends or dreams of her own. Nothing here is real-world or complicated – though there are a couple of conspicuous attempts: in one scene, Smith dons a pair of rubber gloves to wash a bedpan. It’s a fairytale high on teenage narcissism: parents are either absent or eventually humbled by their wise-hearted offspring. Still, as these films always do, it gets you in the end with a left hook to the tear ducts. I was genuinely seething at being manipulated by such mawkish baloney. • Life in a Year is released on 7 June on digital platforms.",Life in a Year,FILM
"420 ","The Killing of Two Lovers review – a riveting portrait of male rage                           ","Pain and rage pulse through this superbly made drama about marital breakdown and male humiliation. The tension is cranked up in its shocking first scene, which works cleverly in tandem with the title, but writer-director Robert Machoian is asking us: which two lovers does that mean, exactly? And what should we make of the very last scene? Does it show us acceptance, despair, or both? David, played by Clayne Crawford, is a married guy in small-town Utah who had dreams of being a singer-songwriter but now does odd jobs; he is separated from his wife Nikki (Sepideh Moafi), a high-flying lawyer, and their four young children. The couple have apparently agreed that she should have the large family house because the children are happier there with her, so David gets to live like a superannuated kid with his ailing widower dad in his ramshackle childhood home nearby. With elaborate formalised courtesy, David and Nikki have agreed that they are “working things out” and “can see other people”, but David is very much aware that it is only Nikki who is seeing someone else: fellow lawyer Derek (Chris Coy), who gets to stay over with the kids in the house. David only wants to get back together, and his rebellious eldest daughter Jess (Avery Pizzuto) hates Derek, hates Nikki, and most of all hates David for being a “loser dad” and accepting it all so meekly. It is having to explain himself to Jess, having to say out loud that he is a pathetic beta male who won’t fight for his family – a mortification he is willing to accept for the sake of children who may actually grow up to despise him – which plants the seed of violence. For all that we might sympathise with the woeful David, who knows how much he was originally at fault? And how much has Derek been told about it? Machoian, who is also the editor, composes each scene with studied care and Oscar Ignacio Jiménez’s clear, crisp cinematography and framing is beautifully achieved. This is a compelling portrait of a toxic marriage. • The Killing of Two Lovers is released on 4 June in cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema.",The Killing of Two Lovers,FILM
"421 ","John Boyega exits Netflix movie mid-shoot for ‘family reasons’                                ","Actor John Boyega has left the Netflix thriller Rebel Ridge mid-shoot because of “family reasons”. According to Deadline, the Small Axe star, who recently won a Golden Globe for his performance in the acclaimed series, has exited the project and will not be returning. Filming started at the beginning of May. “Rebel Ridge is pausing temporarily as we look to re-cast John Boyega who needed to leave the project for family reasons,” a spokesperson told Deadline. “We remain committed to Jeremy Saulnier’s extraordinary film and look forward to resuming production. We look forward to continuing our partnership with John Boyega’s UpperRoom Productions, in addition to our upcoming film They Cloned Tyrone in which he also stars.” Boyega was set to lead the film, from the Green Room director Jeremy Saulnier, which was originally set to shoot in April 2020 until the Covid-19 pandemic. It’s described as “a high-velocity thriller that explores systemic American injustices through intense action sequences, suspense and dark humor”. The remaining cast includes Don Johnson, AnnaSophia Robb, James Cromwell and Emory Cohen. Saulnier broke out with revenge thriller Blue Ruin in 2013. Boyega recently completed the sci-fi comedy They Cloned Tyrone for Netflix, starring alongside Jamie Foxx, Teyonah Parris and Brian Tyree Henry and will next be seen in legal thriller Naked Singularity. It was also recently announced that he will return for a sequel to Attack the Block, the hit adventure that first made him a star. “Yes Attack the Block 2 is happening!” he wrote on Instagram. “Yes I’ll be starring and producing! Yes I’m bloody excited ! London VS them tings.” Further details on Boyega’s departure are as yet unknown.",John Boyega,PERFORMER
"422 ","Gunda review – snuffling about in the secret life of pigs                                     ","The secret life of farm animals remains a secret, but a fascinating and even poignant one, in this strange and unexpectedly subtle film from the Russian documentary-maker Viktor Kossakovsky, whose last movie, Aquarela, was a disturbing meditation on the climate crisis. It’s an extended, black-and-white study of a farmyard sow whose name is presumably Gunda, although the humans who would have given her this name are never shown. There are no people. No dialogue. Just animals. The camera follows this sow around the farm, just after farrowing, and we see the tiny piglets suckling; and later these same piglets, much bigger, still suckling and jostling. We also see the sow’s fellow beasts, including a one-legged chicken and some cows who are shown running in slo-mo – the film’s one bit of over-aestheticisation, which is a misjudgment. Are they all living on the farm together? Maybe not. A closing note on the credits reveals that this was filmed on farms and sanctuaries in Norway, Spain and the UK. Kossakovsky has crafted a fiction, to some extent. (And who knows, maybe the ambient farmyard sounds have also been cheated.) But the film shows something interesting: simply by closing in on the pig’s eyes, it insists on something uncanny. Gunda’s eyes look haunted and sad. The cow’s eyes, on the other hand, seem cold and haughty. Anthropomorphism? Yes, of course. But there is a painful and even tragic meaning that is hidden everywhere on the farm: all these animals are bred to be used and killed and Kossakovsky enigmatically keeps his camera on Gunda after her piglets are finally taken away from her. Gunda seems confused, disoriented, perhaps even stunned. But there is no emotional history here, no emotional affect. The animal just keeps on existing. Gunda has something in common with brutally revelatory documentaries such as Georges Franju’s Blood of the Beasts or Nikolaus Geyrhalter’s Our Daily Bread, which showed the reality of animal slaughter. This shows the weird, blank emptiness that surrounds animals when the fact of slaughter is just out of shot, the empty waiting that precedes the main event. • Gunda is released in cinemas on 4 June.",Gunda,FILM
"423 ","Dream Horse review – true story of a Welsh village that bought a racehorse is a winner        ","Six years ago I found myself gripped by the overwhelmingly likable documentary Dark Horse, which told the amazing true story of Janet Vokes, a former whippet breeder and pigeon fancier from the depressed Welsh village of Cefn Fforest who organised a community syndicate to buy a racehorse. The drinkers at Jan’s local chipped in a weekly £10 sub and their horse, symbolically called Dream Alliance, wound up winning the Welsh Grand National, basically making it the Seabiscuit of the valleys. I predicted at the time that this would be remade as a fiction feature with Imelda Staunton as Jan and Jim Broadbent as her hangdog husband Brian. Well, actually it’s Toni Collette and Owen Teale, with Damian Lewis playing Howard Davies, the local tax accountant and breezy man-of-the-world whose dangerously addictive love of horseracing inspires Jan. The resulting movie may be a bit schmaltzy – actually, a lot schmaltzy – but I couldn’t help enjoying it: like Chariots of Fire, only with horses. That comparison, however, may be down to Chariots cast member Nicholas Farrell here playing the shrewd professional trainer Philip Hobbs. This movie gets a real gallop on, due to the sheer warmth of its performances. Collette, that perennially excellent actor who utterly inhabits every part, gives us a wonderfully approachable Jan: shy, yet tough and determined. Lewis is robust and yet very sympathetic as the rakish Howard who has come very close in the past to losing his shirt to the sport of kings. And it is a treat to see Joanna Page as Howard’s wife Angela and a cameo for Siân Phillips as Maureen, a local woman with a passion for Tunnock’s Tea Cakes. My only slight quibble is that the film’s title, Dream Horse, sounds like something chosen by an algorithm. Why not stick with Dark Horse? Well, no matter. It’s a winner. • Dream Horse is released on 4 June in cinemas.",Dream Horse,FILM

Bourdain’s own voiceover is used, so he appears to narrate his own story. Bourdain killed himself aged 61 in June 2018 while in France shooting a TV show, and the film suggests he may have found it difficult to speak to people about his mental health.

In December, Cruise launched an expletive-laden rant at colleagues on the Mission: Impossible set, after apparent breaches of on-set social distancing guidelines. In an audio recording released by The Sun, Cruise can be heard shouting and swearing at film crew on the project, of which is he one of the producers, warning that anyone caught not following the rules to stay at least 2m (more than 6.5 feet) away from others will be instantly dismissed. On the recording Cruise can be heard shouting: “I don’t ever want to see it again, ever! And if you don’t do it, you’re fired, if I see you do it again, you’re fucking gone. And if anyone in this crew does it – that’s it, and you too and you too … don’t you ever fucking do it again.” “That’s it! No apologies. You can tell it to the people that are losing their fucking homes because our industry is shut down.

The brains behind the operation is the hearing-impaired Regan (Millicent Simmonds), who is teamed up with reluctant protector Emmett (Cillian Murphy) while Noah Jupe’s nervy little brother tends to the family’s newborn.

"427 ","Ahead of the Curve review – in praise of the pioneering lesbian magazine                      ","This fervently supportive documentary about the iconic lesbian magazine Curve and its founder-publisher Frances “Franco” Stevens is directed by Stevens’s wife, Jen Rainin, and it’s both energised and hindered by her preaching-to-the-choir approach. Stevens was a San Francisco woman who in the 1980s got married young, came out as lesbian, was shunned by her family and briefly became homeless. In 1990, she launched what was then called Deneuve magazine by maxing out a handful of brand new credit cards, betting everything at the horse races – and winning big. It’s a staggering story, virtually the American dream in action, especially as Deneuve went from strength to strength, with celebrity interviews, national ads and rocketing circulation. Stevens had the courage and vision to put the word “lesbian” on the cover, and gay women responded passionately to her mission to bring them visibility. In 1995, French movie star Catherine Deneuve sued the magazine for trademark infringement, after which it changed its name to Curve. Actually, Stevens has always denied that that it was named after Catherine Deneuve, and a brisker-minded documentary with more objective journalistic nous might have pressed her harder on this and other points, and tried interviewing Deneuve herself. Stevens became disabled after an accident two years later, and the stress led her to sell the magazine to another publisher; she was forced to look on aghast from the sidelines as her creation (like all print publications) struggled in the digital age. But even more seriously, the new Curve removed the word “lesbian” from the front cover because it was perceived as exclusionary by younger generations of queer women. Stevens had campaigned so fiercely against the erasure of lesbianism. So how does she feel about that? This film never really tackles such difficult questions, but it’s a valuable portrait of a great risk-taker. • Ahead of the Curve is released on 4 June in cinemas and on digital platforms.",Ahead of the Curve,FILM

Kosakovskiy doesn’t attempt to assume the point of view of the pigs, but for 90 minutes he lives among them, his camera taking up residence inside their barn and roaming their pasture at eye level. He also visits and observes their neighbours, including a tentative flock of chickens and a herd of stoic dairy cows. There is no narration, no subtitles and no musical score but, instead, an immersive soundscape of farmyard grunts and squelches. To call the film meditative would be to undersell Kosakovskiy’s instinct for drama and tension. The director gravitates towards runts and stragglers, such as a piglet buried beneath a pile of hay and unceremoniously crushed by its mother. A one-legged chicken is treated with similar reverence. The crisp black and white digital cinematography emphasises the piglets’ downy fur, sleepy eyes and softly rising bellies. It’s an encouragement to acknowledge the beauty, texture and aliveness of the animals. Less successful is the invitation to project interiority on to the creatures’ inscrutable faces – the way the camera fixes on a cow’s intense stare, for example, feels like a call to imbue its gaze with emotional significance.",Gunda,FILM

His overworked and underappreciated wife, Jan (Toni Collette, luminous and easy to root for), has spent 300 quid on a mare with a syndicate of locals, hoping to breed a racehorse to compete with the best. It’s a wise investment, as Dream Alliance turns out to be a winner and a symbol of hope in Cefn Fforest, an economically depressed former mining village in Wales. But they’re not doing it for the money – it’s for the “hwyl”, a Welsh word meaning “emotional motivation and energy”.

Edee is rescued by Miguel (Demián Bichir), a handsome man in a cowboy hat who gently brings her back to life with quiet companionship, hunting lessons, and Tears for Fears karaoke. “Only a person who has never been hungry would think starving is a way to die,” says Miguel, gently prodding at Edee’s privilege (and putting the film in conversation with others in which educated, unhappy white people pursue minimalist living – think Nomadland, Wild, Into the Wild).

In She Said, the pair will play Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor, the New York Times journalists whose landmark expose helped to bring down the movie mogul accused and ultimately convicted of sexual assault. The film is an adaptation of the pair’s bestselling book She Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story That Helped Ignite a Movement, which details their Pulitzer prize-winning work that exposed Weinstein as a predator. He was sentenced to 23 years in prison. The Guardian’s Helen Lewis praised the book as “a hymn to old-fashioned investigative reporting” comparing parts of it to All the President’s Men.

"433 ","Parallel review – alternate reality thriller turns out deeply conventional                    ","Arthur C Clarke once said that there are two possibilities. Either we are alone in the universe or we are not: both are terrifying. But the funny thing in this sci-fi thriller – about parallel universes rather than alien lifeforms – is quite how unterrified, or even awestruck, these four Seattle housemates are when a mirror in their attic turns out to be a portal to a “multiverse” of alternate realities. They barely pause to register the uncanny weirdness of bumping into versions of themselves. Nope, they move straight on to the important matter of making money. What they discover is that the parallel universes (or “alts” as they call them) tick along much like our world: same major events but with slight divergences, particularly in industries like art and tech. “Look, Mona Lisa’s hair is short!” exclaims Leena (Georgia King) flicking through an art book in an alt. (It’s perhaps best not to dwell on the logical impossibilities.) So, this mediocre bunch start stealing ideas from the alts and passing them off as their own – a shortcut to greatness. Ruthlessly ambitious Noel (Martin Wallström), fancying some Elon Musk-style world tech domination, pops behind the mirror to stock up on innovations by actual geniuses. Leena, a struggling artist, appropriates work by a leading painter in an alt and becomes an art world sensation, only to experience a wave of self-loathing. The ideas here present an interesting variation of traditional sci-fi themes from movies such as Groundhog Day, Primer and Flatliners. So it’s a shame that the script goes down the conventional thriller route: success tests the group’s friendships, and there are a couple of showdowns involving guns (neatly solved by the ease of disposing of bodies in other universes). It’s watchable, but don’t expect your mind to be blown – more gently prodded. • Parallel is released on 14 June on digital platforms.",Parallel,FILM
"434 ","Sunflowers review – an intricate portrait of Van Gogh’s iconic series                         ","Not surprisingly, Vincent van Gogh has proved a rich seam for the Exhibition on Screen gallery series, with one of the most commercially potent of modern painters providing material for previous films including Van Gogh in Japan and Van Gogh: A New Way of Seeing. Here, the attention is even more micro, though hardly niche: the series of sunflower studies Van Gogh painted in 1888 and 1889, one of which went on to command a record auction price in the mid 1980s and practically on its own send the art market into the financial stratosphere. Super-familiar though the sunflower paintings may be, this film does a pretty good job of drilling down through the intricacies of the series, from Van Gogh’s earlier “Paris” set, and then the seven pictures he painted in Arles, which provide varying versions of the famous flower-vase arrangement. The film takes us carefully through each of the pictures, showing them in situ and giving the curators the chance to chat, rather like the epic Leonardo tour the same producers released in 2019. This film, though, has the chance to dwell a little longer, sketching in biographical information and offering readings from Van Gogh’s own letters to fill out the artist’s thinking. There’s also an interesting insight into the “competitive gardening” of the era, and the sunflower’s place in it: Oxford University’s Stephen Harris offers a more enthusiastic explainer than you normally get in films like this. Director-producer team David Bickerstaff and Phil Grabsky are past masters at putting this kind of film together, and Sunflowers has the usual mix of smoothly impressive visuals and authoritatively informed comment. The analysis focuses mostly on Van Gogh’s artistic and creative decisions; given that this was such a tumultuous period for his mental health (including the notorious ear-cutting incident after rowing with his houseguest Paul Gauguin), I would have liked to hear more on how it may or may not have fed into the work. Be that as it may, this is a good option for those who are not quite ready to brave the museum, and prefer to try a little cinema-based social distancing instead. • Sunflowers is released on 8 June in cinemas.",Sunflowers,FILM
"435 ","Me, Myself and Di review – miserably unfunny romcom about Bolton’s Bridget Jones","There’s nothing quite so naff and depressing as a British comedy misfire, and Me, Myself and Di is the real deal: a miserably unfunny romcom about Bolton’s answer to Bridget Jones. Her name is Janet Brown (Katy Clayton), and she is a chirpy 30-year-old virgin who works in a supermarket stacking shelves. Janet is devastated when an internet date stands her up: “He took one look at me and ran off because I’m fat and ugly,” she sobs. “You’re not ugly,” quips her glam best friend Diana (Lucy Pinder), always ready to knock Janet’s self-confidence. The world lays indignities upon Janet and then film throws on some more. The character is so thinly written that there’s little for Clayton to do other than perform her with a kind of mouth-open gormlessness. Most of the film is set at an annoyingly anachronistic holiday camp in Rhyl where the two friends go on holiday for a week. Diana gives Janet a makeover for the trip; transforming her into Jeanette De Brun (“It’s French, dead classy,” she reasons). The comedy here is meant to be affectionate social satire, I think. But it feels snidey: a mickey-take of working-class characters hilariously mispronouncing “Tenerife” and “Les Misérables”. Saying that, it’s pretty crass about the upper crust, too. You know as soon as inefficient toff John (Tyger Drew-Honey) stammers a “hello” that he’s Janet’s love interest. He’s on holiday with his cartoonishly snobbish mother (Jenny Funnell) and sister. The silly, kids’-TV-ish plotline here is that Janet maintains the fiction to John that she is wealthy, well-spoken Jeanette from “higher Bolton”. He sees through the act, of course, and loves her for who she really is. The whole thing is pretty hopeless but I did laugh at one gag, when Janet uses the loo in John’s static caravan.

Hogg will be premiering The Souvenir Part II, the follow-up to her loosely autobiographical 2019 drama The Souvenir, which like the first film will feature Honor Swinton Byrne in the lead role. Barnard, whose last film was the 2017 drama Dark River, and who is currently working on the Apple TV mini-series The Essex Serpent, is due to bring Ali &amp; Ava to Cannes; starring Adeel Akhtar and Claire Rushbrook, it is described as “a contemporary British love story that explores the intricacies of age, class and race”. Meanwhile Rohwacher, who won the best screenplay award at the 2018 Cannes film festival for Happy as Lazzaro, joins Pietro Marcello and Francesco Munzi for a documentary, Futura, billed as an examination of “the different expectations and prospects for the future” of Italian teenagers. Williams and Uzeyman have joined forces on Neptune’s Frost, which Williams described as “the love story between an inter-sex runaway, a coltan miner and the virtual marvel born as a result of their union”.

"437 ","The Amusement Park review – George Romero’s absurdist nightmare on growing old                ","George Romero’s deeply odd, brief feature – an absurdist nightmare featuring silent-movie style melodrama acting – was made in 1973, long considered lost and now restored and rereleased. It was commissioned by the Lutheran Service Society, who were hoping for a film about the problems of growing old and the necessity of helping and respecting older people, and were reportedly upset by how Romero interpreted the brief. What he gave them was a very disquieting and upsetting fantasy about a distinguished, kindly old gentleman in a dapper white suit wandering around a crowded funfair, only to discover that the fair (like life itself) is for the young; the old people are there to be patronised, infantilised, bullied, ignored, robbed and terrorised. A mishap at a bumper car ride ends with a bizarre appearance by a traffic cop and an insurance agent who are all sure that the old person must be in the wrong. A sinister “see your future” sideshow tent astonishes a pair of young lovers by revealing to them their destiny as a poor, sick old married couple and the man is so enraged he assaults our white-clad hero – because he is old. A “freaks” display turns out to be a simple parade of old people. And so it goes on. The lead actor is Lincoln Maazel, who went on to star in Romero’s 1978 horror Martin (and was, incidentally, the father of the conductor Lorin Maazel); he gives a dignified and stately introduction to the film in the weirdly deserted fairground, and also a thoughtful coda just before the credits. These bookending sections show how this peculiar work was intended to function as something like British public information films on TV with their deeply disturbing little vignettes. Maazel earnestly tells the audience to get involved with volunteering organisations.

"438 ","Agony review – Asia Argento stars in atmospheric horror where house is the star               ","It might be something of a surprise to see a new movie starring Asia Argento, a leading figure in the #MeToo movement; Agony, directed by Argento’s ex-husband Michele Civetta, was actually completed in 2017. This atmospheric film hovers somewhere between a gothic horror and a giallo. Isidora (Argento) is a tightly wound Italian artist living in New York with her husband and young daughter. Plagued by strange visions of an occult ceremony, Isidora continues to unravel when she discovers that her mother, whom she believes is long dead, only passed away recently and has left her a vast estate in Tuscany. Isidora confronts her father, who confesses that he shielded her from the truth because of her mother’s debilitating mental illness. Isidora, along with her family, heads to the estate to oversee her mother’s funeral, and she is haunted by the image of a lady in red and begins to lose her grip on reality. It’s the old, mysterious mansion that emerges as the real star. Baroque fading wallpapers, ornate painted ceiling, the winding corridors and halls; they all carry whispers of secrets and generate a palpable sense of unease. The first half of the film is an especially impressive mood piece, contrasting the foggy, unknowable landscape with Isidora’s worsening psyche. Stellar support performances from Monica Guerritore, who plays the forbidding housekeeper Angelica, and veteran actor Franco Nero further enhance the conspiratorial atmosphere. Unfortunately, when Agony veers into the more explicitly horror territories, the garish colour effects cheapen the overall ambience. Poorly written dialogue also renders Isidora’s breakdown uninspired rather than moving. It’s a shame that, for all of its unnerving tonal registers, not to mention a gorgeous score, Agony winds up with a painfully predictable ending. • Agony is released on 14 June on digital platforms.",Agony,FILM
"439 ","Brabham review – bumpy portrait of old-school F1 legend                                       ","This is a documentary about Australian motor sports legend Jack Brabham that aims to finesse the usual greatest-hits highlights by including some darker material: family strife, on-track bad behaviour, behind-the-scenes fallouts. Brabham remains best known for being the only Formula One driver to win the world title in a car of their own construction, and this profile makes much of his engineering skills and constant tinkering in the workshop. He also raced throughout the sport’s most dangerous era – see the jaw-dropping BBC documentary Grand Prix: The Killer Years – with apparently barely a scratch, though there are some amusing shots of Brabham being forced to push his car over the line after running out of fuel on a number of occasions. Things get more complicated in the second half of the film: Brabham’s racing style comes in for some veiled criticism for its “elbow’s out” quality, and he was apparently known for deliberately running over trackside gravel so stones would kick up into rival drivers’ faces. His relationship with longtime car designer Ron Tauranac, a key figure in Brabham’s racing success, was also fractious, with the pair falling out; despite this, Tauranac took over the Brabham racing marque until selling it on to Bernie Ecclestone. And two of Brabham’s sons, David and Geoff, both racers themselves, talk of their father as a distant, emotionally unavailable individual. (His third son, convicted child rapist Gary Brabham, appears to have been edited out of the story.) All this is accomplished via the customary stream of talking heads from the sport’s glory years, though the film-makers – perhaps attempting to bolster their take-no-prisoners credentials – have an odd tic of including unflattering interview outtakes, such as former McLaren CEO Ron Dennis moaning at someone behind him ruining the shot: it’s a device that belongs in less conventional films. • Brabham is released on 14 June on digital platforms.",Brabham,FILM
"440 ","Nobody review – bone-crunchingly enjoyable geri-action from Bob Odenkirk                      ","Geriatric action stars, like geriatric millennials, might be having a bit of a moment. Bob Odenkirk, better known as slippery lawyer Saul Goodman in TV’s Breaking Bad and its spin-off Better Call Saul, unexpectedly gets to bust out some serious fight moves at the age of 58. That’s two years older than Liam Neeson was when he made Taken, and eight years older than Keanu Reeves at the time of the first John Wick film, though Reeves admittedly already had the action chops. Nobody, from screenwriter Derek Kolstad (creator of John Wick) and the Russian action director Ilya Naishuller, gives us Odenkirk as a nobody: a boring guy called Hutch with two kids, who works at some dull machine tools plant, while his more glamorous wife Becca (Connie Nielsen) brings home more bacon as an estate agent. When a couple of armed punks break into his house one night, Hutch is humiliated by his failure to protect his family. But like Kenny Rogers’ Coward of the County, Hutch has a surprise in store for us. Something inside him snaps when he realises that the robbers took his daughter’s kitty bracelet, and it seems that there is something in his professional past that has not been made plain to us. Hutch goes on an undisciplined emotional rampage, and winds up fortuitously beating the living jeepers out of half a dozen Russian gangsters on a bus: an entertainingly gonzo sequence. But a serious Russian mobster wants revenge on Hutch and this is the granite-faced Yulian, played by Aleksey Serebryakov (whom devotees of a higher-brow sort of film might remember as the desolate car mechanic in Andrey Zvyagintsev’s Leviathan.) It has to be said that Nobody rattles enjoyably and bone-crunchingly along and as for Odenkirk, this career turn more or less pays off. He never tries to be macho exactly, and spends a lot of his time flinching and scowling at all the cuts and bruises on his face. But his fisticuffs and over-the-top weapons mayhem look plausible enough. As far as action stardom goes, Odenkirk might yet be somebody. • Nobody is released on 9 June in cinemas.",Nobody,FILM
"441 ","Shiva Baby review – black comedy is a festival of excruciating embarrassment                  ","This debut feature from 25-year-old writer-director Emma Seligman is an amusing, self-aware, indulgent and transparently personal chamber piece, developed from an earlier short she submitted as her NYU thesis film. It could have been partly inspired by the party scene at the beginning of The Graduate, the one where smug oldsters tell Dustin Hoffman’s character he should be getting into plastics. Actor and online comic Rachel Sennott plays Danielle, aimlessly out of college and picking up cash with what she tells her parents is a regular “babysitting” gig; one day she shows up with them at a shiva (that is, the Jewish observance not dissimilar to a wake) expecting to endure only the usual questioning from relatives about why she is so thin, why she doesn’t have a boyfriend and what she’s going to do with her life. But to her horror she sees Max (Danny Deferrari), the wealthy married man with whom she has been having sex for money. Max, though venal and smugly exploitative, had also been becoming increasingly tender towards Danielle, believing her story that she needs cash for grad school. He too is aghast at their unexpected meeting in this unsexy setting: she is a very different, subdued, schoolgirlish and slightly brattish figure, from whose tutting relatives he indirectly learns that the grad school story is nonsense, and she has no plans, nor any pressing need for money, because her adoring parents (Fred Melamed and Polly Draper) are picking up every tab. To add to this festival of excruciating embarrassment, Danielle sees Maya (Molly Gordon), a young woman she once semi-officially dated, and with whom she may still be in love. This is a very intense, claustrophobic black comedy whose inner anxiety is underlined by Ariel Marx’s nerve-jangling score, which seems always to be leading us to some eruption of emotional hurt. And, in fact, there are two or three moments where the buzz of conversation is suddenly stilled by the raising of voices. The film is maybe a little callow, but it’s an undoubtedly impressive and accomplished debut. • Shiva Baby is released on 9 June in cinemas and on 11 June on Mubi.",Shiva Baby,FILM
"442 ","Lin-Manuel Miranda’s In the Heights could boost movie theaters’ recovery                      ","The eagerly awaited Lin-Manuel Miranda movie In the Heights has arrived with enthusiastic fans headed to theaters and HBO Max on Thursday and through the weekend. The film, which centers on a group of Latino characters in the Washington Heights neighborhood of New York City, has received largely positive reviews, and signs are that it is set to reel in big audiences, following a slew of other popular releases such as A Quiet Place Part 2 and Godzilla vs Kong hoping to draw people back to theaters this summer. In a poll of 1,300 moviegoers by the ticketing company Fandango, 96% of responders said In the Heights, which follows Miranda’s successful Broadway musical, would be the first film they go to post-pandemic, while the Jon M Chu-directed film is the top-selling show for this Friday and Saturday. If the film can turn out viewers, it will be a boost for an industry hit hard by the pandemic. Movie theaters were among the last places to reopen from lockdown in most states, and in New York, to take one example, most are still limited to about one-third capacity. In an interview with NBC, Miranda, who co-wrote the film with Quiara Alegría Hudes, the pair wanted to highlight Latino characters and culture, which are both frequently overlooked in Hollywood output. “We’re making up for lost time,” Miranda said. The film is based on Miranda’s 2008 musical of the same name, which preceded his global hit, Hamilton. He told NBC he and Hudes wanted to create non-stereotypical Latino characters: “Quiara and I stuck to our guns and stuck to what we felt was important in the storytelling of the show.” The first quarter of 2021 saw a decline of 90% in movie theater ticket sales, CNBC reported, but with 75% of North American theaters now open, the last two weekends have set pandemic-era records for tickets sold. Over the four-day Memorial Day weekend North America theaters brought in $100m in ticket sales – less than half the $232m over the same period in 2019, but an encouraging sign for studio executives. The Guardian critic Peter Bradshaw gave In the Heights three stars, describing it as “a sweet-natured film with Sunny-D optimism and a no-place-like-home ethic”, with “a pretty quaint image of street life, whose unrealities probably worked better on stage”.",Lin-Manuel Miranda,PERFORMER
"443 ","69: The Saga of Danny Hernandez review – Tekashi69, fame-hungry narcissist, unwrapped","Independent film-maker Vikram Gandhi tells a truly all-American rags-to-riches-to-documentary-fodder story, one intensely grounded in the terroir of New York City, about his Bushwick neighbour Tekashi69, AKA 6ix9ine, AKA Danny Hernandez. Those over the age of 30 who are not au fait with what the kids are into these days may be less familiar with Hernandez’s story, and thus why he might be deserving of a documentary, so here are the key facts. Raised in poverty in Brooklyn’s not-yet-gentrified Bushwick, he went from working in a bodega to becoming a rap superstar notorious for his facial tattoos, rainbow-coloured hair, sexually explicit videos and gangster attitude. After several earlier brushes with the law, including pleading guilty to using a child in a sexual performance, he was arrested in 2018 on a number of charges including racketeering, conspiracy to commit murder and armed robbery, so he flipped on his own crew, the Nine Trey gang, got a reduced sentence and was later released from prison into home confinement because of the Covid outbreak. Editorialising throughout via voiceover, Gandhi adroitly navigates the problematic morality of his subject, a fame-hungry narcissist with a traumatic childhood, some talent and an ability to charm. But that doesn’t mean Gandhi, or more importantly the people in Hernandez’s life such as Sara Molina, his childhood sweetheart andthe mother of his child, or the friends he betrayed, have to forgive him. The film throws a wide net and features many in Hernandez’s circle, from his tattooist and the lovely woman who dyed his hair, to his producer, who remains loyal to the crazy kid he first met. Having been a cinematographer on several other films, Gandhi serves up great street footage of Bushwick and beyond. He also has a Werner Herzogian knack for hilariously weird moments, like the one in the opening scene where he’s trying to get someone to open up about Hernandez, only to have the interview sabotaged by a woman shouting from a window above (very New York) that he shouldn’t say shit about 6ix9ine, that he didn’t know the guy, that he has nothing to say. Even viewers who might find 6ix9ine and his gangbanger nonsense repugnant can still find much to admire in this well-made film essay. • 69: The Saga of Danny Hernandez is available on Altitude.film",69: The Saga of Danny Hernandez,FILM
"444 ","The Hitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard review – Ryan Reynolds back in a tiresome sequel                ","Here’s the tiresome follow-up to the tiresome action comedy with the tiresomely (and unfunnily) muddled premise: bodyguards generally protect people against hitmen and hitmen generally don’t need bodyguards as they’re not publicly visible … but that wasn’t the point. Anyway, here’s the sequel with the extra-clumsy double-possessive in the title. Ryan Reynolds is back as Michael Bryce, the former triple-A rated bodyguard, now haunted and traumatised by his professional failures, and by his association with the notorious assassin Darius Kincaid, played by Samuel L Jackson. Michael is stripped of his “licence” to practise bodyguarding and is now in therapy; but just as he decides to take a restorative European break by the pool, Michael gets sucked right back into the melee by Kincaid’s badass wife Sonia, in which role Salma Hayek is once again phoning in her hellcat routine. So the wacky trio are back together again, Reynolds getting whatever laugh lines there are going, as he is bemused and depressed by the situation that this couple have put him in, though not as bemused and depressed as all of us in the audience. They find themselves up against Greek supervillain Aristotle Papadopoulous, played by Antonio Banderas with such an uncompromising refusal to do a Greek accent that at first I thought it had to be some kind of gag. The idea is that he will use a super-strong drill to damage the underwater junction box that holds the data for the European Union’s computer systems, as a revenge for the EU beating up on his home country. (This would have been topical around the time of the “Grexit” row of 2012.) So we have loads of Euro-locations and loads of car chase scenes through picturesque tourist cities, with cars lumbering down crumbling stone steps and at one stage even smashing through the traditional fruit-stall. There are also some weirdly pedantic references to the Goldie Hawn comedy Overboard, perhaps to pre-empt objections to possible plot-borrowings. To add to all his anxieties, Michael is also afflicted by feelings of inferiority in comparison with his stepfather, a legendary veteran bodyguard: a great big comedy cameo for a big name who is entirely wasted in the part. There are some almost-laughs here and there, but please tell me that we aren’t in for The Hitman’s Mother-In-Law’s Agent’s Bodyguard in 2023. • The Hitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard is released on 18 June in cinemas.",The Hitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard,FILM
"445 ","Running Against the Wind review – brothers fight for their future in Ethiopian sports drama   ","Opening with the impressionistic image of a young man sprinting across the desert, his figure blurred by the sandy blast of a dust devil, Jan Philipp Weyl’s film ruminates on life’s unexpected whirlwinds that can either uplift one’s hopes or blow them to pieces. Abdi (Ashenafi Nigusu) and Solomon (Mikias Wolde) are childhood friends who grow up in rural Ethiopia. Their paths diverge dramatically when Solomon runs away to the big city with dreams of becoming a photographer, only to end up on the streets, scraping for food and mixing with bad company. Ten years later, Abdi, who idolises the Olympic runner Haile Gebrselassie, also moves to the capital, where he continues training and even wins a national championship. After an emotional reunion, Abdi tries to pull Solomon out of his precarious situation, but fate has other plans. The film deftly explores the complexities of brotherhood, be it the bond between Solomon and his fellow outcasts, or the camaraderie among Abdi’s athletic team. Though perhaps not always assured in their performances, Nigusu and Wolde capture their characters’ first hug after years apart in a beautifully bittersweet moment. Shyly smiling at each other, the two young men suddenly and movingly revert to their childhood selves. Such intimacy, however, is overshadowed by dramatic contrivances: instead of focusing on the changing tides of the pair’s rapport, the film jumps from sports film empowerment cliches to full-on action sequence, making for an inconsistent tone. Quibbles aside, this is still an engaging watch that even gets a cameo from Gebrselassie. The deft camerawork showcases a dynamic Ethiopia – from tiny villages to the gritty underbelly of bustling Addis Ababa – and, let’s face it, everyone loves a good training montage. • Running Against the Wind is released on 11 June on digital platforms.",Running Against the Wind,FILM

But there’s a disconnect between the naive but well-intentioned storytelling and the explosive swearing that ensures a 15 certificate and places the film out of reach of the younger teen audience who might, otherwise, have been its most receptive.

"447 ","Nobody review – Bob Odenkirk is a blast in action man mode                                    ","Bob Odenkirk, best known for playing a gutter lawyer in Better Call Saul, is not the first name that springs to mind to claim the aggrieved everyman action slot recently vacated by Liam Neeson. But from the opening shot – battered face cross-hatched with scratches, shackled hands effortlessly snapping open a Zippo lighter – the question is not the casting, but what took Hollywood so long to weaponise the ineffable coolness of Odenkirk. He plays Hutch Mansell, a sad sack number-cruncher at his father-in-law’s factory and husband adrift from his distant wife (Connie Nielsen). Snappy editing gives a flick-book summary of the daily disappointments of Hutch’s life and Russian director Ilya Naishuller combines a showily kinetic verve with a crackle of wry humour. When thieves break into his home, Hutch chooses de-escalation rather than baseball bat retaliation - the right thing to do - but he feels himself diminished in the eyes of his family. The event awakens something within him, but it’s the realisation that the thieves stole his daughter’s kitty-cat bracelet that unleashes a long dormant lust for justice (deployed with knives, guns, grenades, fire extinguishers and his pensioner dad, sprung from the retirement home and armed to the dentures). Hutch finds a worthy adversary in “connected, funded sociopath” Yulian (Aleksey Serebryakov), a Russian in a shiny suit that looks like it was flayed from a live shark. And if this all sounds a little John Wick-a-like, that’s perhaps to be expected – the films share a writer in Derek Kolstad, Hollywood’s go-to guy for crazy-violent, hyper-adrenalised popcorn thrills. It’s a blast.",Nobody,FILM
"448 ","Don’t Look Back review – smartphone morality shocker fails to connect                         ","There was something almost camp about death in the Final Destination series, the invisible hand that toyed with us as it liquidated its characters. Franchise originator Jeffrey Reddick tries to recapture that high-concept magic in his directorial debut Don’t Look Back, also about a lethal force stalking a group bound by calamity. But here he bleaches it of humour and adds a nagging moralistic component – possibly with an eye on the faith-movie market. This time, karma is the invisible antagonist stalking six “bad Samaritans”, who fail to intervene – one committing the cardinal sin and whipping out his smartphone instead – when a local philanthropist gets beaten up at the park. But for Caitlin (Kourtney Bell) her paralysis has personal reasons: it triggers flashbacks to the recent home invasion in which her father was killed. Not that that excuse placates the victim’s brother, Lucas (Will Stout), and hostile public opinion. When one of the group makes a sudden upper-storey window exit, there seems to be some supernatural Jeremy Kyle coming to pass judgment on them all – or so Caitlin believes. With Don’t Look Back very much feeling like a ropey first draft of Final Destination, Reddick’s gimmick here is fuzzy compared to the franchise’s ruthless focus on the feasibility of outsmarting death. In Don’t Look Back, Reddick tries to set Caitlin a similar fiendish brainteaser, rooted in serial appearances of the number 27, but it is thin gruel plot-wise. The least we can ask for are some virtuoso demises – but with the film only half-heartedly invested in the inter-group dynamics and the individual stakes involved, they are disappointingly vanilla and unimpactful when they come. Karma, it seems, operates mostly by unlucky falls. It’s simpler for Don’t Look Back to preach fire and brimstone on the smartphone dilemma – which, when virtually everyone in the digital age is guilty of voyeurism to some degree, feels rather early-2000s and un-nuanced. The directing is serviceable, but some rote imagery – especially the ominous crow of death – also likes to hit us over the head. Reddick should have concentrated on giving the characters that kind of treatment. • Don’t Look Back is release on digital platforms on 14 June.",Don’t Look Back,FILM
"449 ","Shock Wave: Hong Kong Destruction review – one long tick-tick-boom symphony                   ","The “2” in the original title of this film would suggest this Hong Kong-action thriller is a sequel – or more likely a prequel given its ending – to the 2017 film Shock Wave, which like this starred megastar Andy Lau and was directed by one of his regular collaborators, Herman Yau. In fact, there’s no connective narrative tissue at all between the films, apart from the fact that the hero in both works for the Hong Kong police department’s Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) bureau, or bomb disposal unit. Still, the end result offers a regular drumbeat of suspense-followed-by-explosion throughout – one long tick-tick-boom symphony, in fact – which makes for fitfully stimulating entertainment. Lau plays Poon Sing-fung, the EOD’s most reckless yet heroic debomber, who is best friends with his superior, Tung (Ching Wan Lau), and in a happy romantic relationship with pretty police officer Pong Ling (Ni Ni). The couple’s happiness is mostly represented in the early scenes by her looking simperingly at him while he laughs in a reckless yet heroic fashion. But one call-out goes wrong, and just when Poon thinks he’s saved everyone in a squalid flat, a cat in a booby-trapped microwave blows up and Poon loses half of his left leg. Nevertheless, he puts everything into building up strength in his remaining limbs in order to return to his old job, which not so coincidentally dovetails with Lau’s real-world support for the Paralympics and disabled athletes. Then the movie rapidly gets much more tricksy in its storytelling: a group of terrorists called Vendetta are sifted into the mix; they are led by a white-haired Julian Assange-like leader (Tse Kwan-Ho) and are hellbent on blowing stuff up and getting revenge for past slights. Has Poon, like Lau’s character in Infernal Affairs (the model for The Departed), been a mole all this time in the terrorist organisation? Or is he a mole posing as a mole? A bad case of post-traumatic amnesia Poon suffers after yet another explosion means even he doesn’t know which side he used to be on, or which one he wants to be on now. It’s all a bit otiose and a little stale, especially all the ersatz medical talk about brain injuries. Despite a few modish touches, this feels fundamentally very old-school, and not necessarily in a good way, right down to the repeated shots of people running away from fireballs in the background. • Shock Wave: Hong Kong Destruction is released on 14 June on digital platforms.",Shock Wave: Hong Kong Destruction,FILM

"452 ","The Viewing Booth review – seeing is believing in the Israel-Palestine conflict               ","Even though he tries to maintain a cool, scientific demeanour, Israeli director Ra’anan Alexandrowicz finally lets slip a twinge of despair at the end of this interesting geopolitical Rorschach test. Alexandrowicz sits studiously behind a monitor as he invites a succession of volunteers to enter an adjacent booth. There, they have a choice of 40 clips to watch, snippets of life in Israel, while he asks them to share their thoughts on what they see. Half of the clips are from rightwing Israeli sources; the other half are from B’Tselem, an Israeli human-rights organisation that aims to document abuses of power in Palestinian territories. Alexandrowicz quickly zeroes in on the pensive Maia, a Jewish American who supports Israel, but brings an insistent scepticism to everything she watches. He is the director of pro-Palestine documentaries such as The Inner Tour (2001) and The Law in These Parts (2011) – and believes her to be his ideal audience: a possible convert. From the sympathy she displays on watching flagrant abuses such as a soldier kicking a street kid, that seems like a realistic hope. But it’s quickly apparent that Maia filters everything through confirmation bias. When one child seems to misremember his own name in a B’Tselem video of a home search by Israeli soldiers, she wonders whether it has been staged. At the same time as interrogating the film-makers’ agenda, Maia is also aware of her own possible distortions, which stem from a desire to believe that Israeli actions are justified. Above and beyond the Middle Eastern context, this is the kind of due diligence – a state of permanent alertness about film-maker and viewer, their intentions and baggage – that our information-saturated age demands of all of us. Alexandrowicz brings Maia, with a sleek new haircut, back for a second session, to review the footage and her own initial reactions. But she doubles down, saying: “Sometimes when you question your beliefs and you come up with better answers, they reinforce your beliefs even more.” The director, on the back foot, just about clings to his sang-froid. Not just a valuable crash course in digital-age hermeneutics, this is a gauntlet thrown down to film-makers with an old-fashioned belief in the truth. • The Viewing Booth is in cinemas from 18 June.",The Viewing Booth,FILM
"453 ","Edge of the World review – swashbuckling white saviour biopic feels out of date               ","While the name James Brooke might seem obscure to many viewers, his exploits in south-east Asia, retold here in Michael Haussman’s adventure biopic, are not so foreign. After all, they inspired Joseph Conrad’s Lord Jim and Rudyard Kipling’s The Man Who Would Be King. Brooke’s stranger-than-fiction journey from ex-soldier in the Bengal army to becoming the White Rajah of Sarawak, which once attracted the attention of Errol Flynn, is especially ripe for the silver screen. Alas, Edge of the World fails to do justice to this fascinating and deeply complex chapter in British colonial history. The film begins with Brooke (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) arriving in picturesque Sarawak via boat, along with his cousin Arthur (Dominic Monaghan) and nephew Charley (Otto Farrant), both army men. Their presence is immediately met with suspicion and hostility from the local aristocrats, especially Prince Mahkota (Bront Palarae). Brooke’s courageous efforts during a pirates’ siege, however, lead to his being crowned Rajah, much to the dismay of Mahkota. As Brooke strives to establish the domain as a sovereign nation, his reign faces Mahkota’s bloody attacks, not to mention criminal charges from the British empire. Edge of the World cannot, unfortunately, resist over mythologising Brooke’s legacy; such an approach only strips the first White Rajah of his complexities and ambiguities. Sidestepping the hard question of whether Brooke is a white saviour, the narrative’s superficial view appears to suggest that he is a “benevolent” imperialist merely because, unlike his peers, he does not say racist things out loud. Meanwhile, Brooke’s actual policies and style of governance remain largely unexplored, overshadowed by a romance plot and endless depictions of gory native customs. As Edge of the World gradually veers into Apocalypse Now territory, the ties between Sarawak and Brooke turn woefully simplistic. Edge of the World might work as an ode to bygone swashbuckling classics, but Brooke deserves a much more nuanced biopic. • Edge of the World is on digital platforms from 18 June.",Edge of the World,FILM

"455 ","Superdeep review – spore-squirting Soviet horror ends up fusty                                ","Like Chernobyl with mould, this Soviet-era-set Russian horror-sci-fi follows experts racing against the clock to put the lid on a disaster inside a government facility: here it’s a top secret research station seven miles underground, the source of an apocalyptic outbreak of fungus. As with Chernobyl, the movie features strong 80s moustaches, lab coats, and characters frequently prefixing “comrade” to each other’s names. Exasperatingly, the missing ingredient is a well-developed storyline; nothing in the muddled script hangs together. I had the feeling I’d walked into the cinema five minutes late and missed some critical all-explaining first scene. What Superdeep does have going for it is a cracking hero: a brilliant young epidemiologist sent in by military top brass to gather samples of whatever is happening underground. She is Anna (Milena Radulović), a character who shares DNA with Jodie Foster in The Silence of the Lambs with a little of Ripley from the Alien movies. Rather than snap into bad-ass butt-kicker at the first sign of trouble, Anna takes on the forces of fungus with her brains. In fact, during the scary bits she looks terrified, deathly pale, breathing shallowly. In a film of laughably bad dialogue – I kept my eye firmly on her face (oh, and her Soviet-chic yellow roll-neck). Worryingly, on the way down to the research unit, one of the grizzled miners being evacuated growls: “It’s hell down there.” What Anna finds – without getting spoilery – is a spore-squirting Alien-inspired parasitical nightmare. To begin, there are a couple of genuinely repulsive horror moments, but things get silly very quickly. The film finishes in retro disaster-movie mode: emergency red lights flashing, alarms blaring – anyone who’s still alive crawling about in the dark and dust. Irritatingly the script engineers a way for Anna to do this in her vest and knickers. What a let-down. • Superdeep is released on 17 June on Shudder.",Superdeep,FILM

"457 ","Treasure City review – bizarre, oppressive and horribly brutal","A one-night-in-the-city movie from Hungary with an ensemble cast interconnecting and interrelating in bizarrely unexpected ways; the city in question is perhaps Budapest, though it was filmed in Cluj, in Romania. The keynotes are anger, confusion and despair, and to some degree the film could have been opaque or contrived but its malaise ultimately finds expression in a truly horrible #MeToo moment, one of the most brutally plausible and unsettling I have seen in any film recently. The cast are various: the organisers of a protest against the reactionary government have a row over competency, and an associate of theirs has a romantic moment with a Mohawk-haired teen son of a sourly depressed pastor and his angry wife. A woman has a furious row with a rude and supercilious sales assistant in a flower shop. Her husband is enraged to hear of a sad romantic escapade in the past and their 10-year-old daughter turns out to have magic powers. They have a link with an intimate and experimental “living room theatre” troupe whose deeply unpleasant director is a predatory rapist, furnishing this movie with the climactically horrendous scene near the end. And so it goes on, with the various lives playing out more or less simultaneously. This is an odd film, opaque and withdrawn, and with a muted and discreet kind of surrealism, particularly in its cafe scenes, that reminded me a little of directors such as Roy Andersson or Aki Kaurismäki, only without the emollient touch of comedy. Quite a lot of the movie is oppressively sexualised, in ways that create a charged and dangerous atmosphere, but also somehow unrewarding. Where is it all leading? That isn’t clear, though the abuse scene seems to grow like a dark flower from the estrangement and unhappiness that has gone before. • Treasure City is in cinemas and on digital platforms from 18 June.",Treasure City,FILM
"458 ","The Reason I Jump review – an empathic study of nonverbal autism                              ","Here is a documentary with something to tell us and something to teach us. It’s inspired by the 2007 book of the same name by the Japanese teenager Naoki Higashida, who has nonverbal autism: explaining why he behaves as he does, when and why he feels joy and fear and why he sometimes jumps, why he responds with great and uncontrolled physical activity. It was translated into English in 2013 by Keiko Yoshida and her husband, the British novelist David Mitchell. The original book was transcribed by Higashida’s mother by getting him to use an alphabet-grid prompt system, leading some sceptics to claim that the book was basically authored by her: a rendering of what she thinks her son is thinking, or even just a YA fantasy. But this film is actually a vigorous rebuttal to this, and makes an overwhelmingly plausible case that young neurodivergent people really can communicate through the alphabet-grid. The film shows young people with autism from all over the world, from the US to the UK to India and Africa, and brings us into their world, letting us appreciate how they are sometimes drowned by sensory perception and emotion, by memories that they cannot structure and contextualise the way others can. But the film also shows that though speech is effectively a fine motor activity that eludes them, pointing out letters on a grid is a gross motor skill that can be mastered – simply, they can point at letters – and so self-expression is possible. It is an intriguing and empathic study, which could help all of us to understand. My only quibble is that the voiceover representing Higashida’s narration is a little mannered and I would have liked to hear more specifically about the way some neurodivergent people appear to have a brilliant artistic sense (there is one such here) and their artistry does not consist of abstract emotional splodges but meticulously rendered drawings with just that sense of proportion and scale that seems to be the problem in other aspects of autistic people’s lives. Well, it is an excellent and educational work. • This article was amended on 21 June 2021 to correct references to neurodiverse people to neurodivergent people. • The Reason I Jump is released on 18 June in cinemas.",The Reason I Jump,FILM
"459 ","Friendship’s Death review – Tilda Swinton goes alien in a radical-chic Beckettian fable       ","In 1987, the late English critic, theorist and film-maker Peter Wollen directed his only solo feature film: an insouciantly baffling two-hander called Friendship’s Death, now rereleased. It was a cinema of ideas, rare then, rarer now, high-mindedly produced by the British Film Institute and Channel 4. Bill Paterson plays Sullivan: a hardbitten, boozy journalist holed up in a shabby hotel in Amman in Jordan in 1970, during the civil war and the “Black September” era of PLO hijackings. He is astonished – though, amusingly, never quite as astonished you think he ought to be – to be confronted by a hyperintelligent and ethereally beautiful young woman named Friendship, who hangs out in his room and reveals herself to be a creature sent from a distant planet to study humankind. She is played by Tilda Swinton, like a cross between ET and David Bowie in The Man Who Fell to Earth. There’s a fair bit of posturing and radical chic happening in this movie and it’s sometimes a little glib. But the droll double-act chemistry between Paterson and Swinton is unexpectedly great, especially considering the enigmatically childlike and lovably humourless demeanour that Swinton often projects. It’s not at all clear to me if Wollen or Swinton realised that this film is a comedy, but I think that this is what Friendship’s Death is: Beckettian in its way, but with something more emollient. Having crossly objected to the way Sullivan deafeningly hammers out his stories by banging away at the typewriter keys, Friendship taps out something of her own, taking up the machine when Sullivan probably needs it to file a story. “What are you typing?” asks the exasperated Sullivan. “My dream,” Friendship pertly replies. “… I dream of succulents, the flow of carbon in acid metabolism, hunters and gatherers …” Later we see Friendship alertly watching a football match on television, Arsenal v Spurs. (Could you watch first division fixtures in Amman hotel rooms in 1970? Live or just highlights?) “It’s hard for me to see the attraction of it …” she says. As a semiotician, Wollen couldn’t resist closing the film with a wordless five-minute sequence, a recorded message from Friendship, which the audience had to decode as best they could. I wonder if Paterson and Swinton could be persuaded to reunite for a sequel: Friendship’s Survival? • Friendship’s Death is released on 21 June on digital platforms.",Friendship’s Death,FILM
"460 ","Battle of the Bulge: Winter War review – a fight until the bitter end                         ","This stilted, herky-jerky tale of Yankee heroism – written and directed by, as well as starring, Steven Luke – seems to be a sequel to Luke’s earlier second world war saga, Wunderland, a work not well-reviewed nor widely seen. In this instalment, Luke’s wholesome, square-jawed protagonist Lt Cappa and his ethnically diverse yet strangely interchangeable-looking men are defending a field hospital just behind the frontline near Lanzerath, Belgium, as the titular Battle of the Bulge rages in December 1944. The larger goal for the allies, represented here mostly by Tom Berenger and Billy Zane talking in a tent as they play Maj McCulley and Gen Omar Bradley, is to take control of fuel supplies to the Germans who might be on the verge of winning the war. Plus, there’s a squad of American MPs knocking around with almost comically exaggerated accents who turn out to be German spies. Luckily, Cappa and his comrades sense there’s something off about this crew, especially when they try to commandeer their jeeps and suggest leaving the wounded behind to die. Apparently, Winter War was shot in Minnesota, Illinois and South Dakota, which would account for why nearly everything seems to take place in temporary buildings, and we see so little of the local Belgians that the Americans are ostensibly trying to save. The dialogue is risibly cliche-ridden and, although chock full of explication, utterly confusing in terms of explaining what’s going on. It all feels very dated and artless, like someone’s grandpa wrote the script 50 years ago and it was found in a drawer, then financed and made with a not inconsiderable budget for extras, vintage tanks and lots of old uniforms. The widescreen cinematography is actually rather lush, but more might have been better spent on editing and a musical score that actually syncs up with the action. • Battle of the Bulge: Winter War is released on 21 June on digital platforms.",Battle of the Bulge: Winter War,FILM
"461 ","Sherni review – Vidya Balan joins the hunt for a man-eating tiger                             ","After the success of his 2017 political black comedy Newton, director Amit V Masurkar once again aims to shed light on India’s contemporary social issues. Ostensibly a thriller, Sherni tackles sexism and the absurdities of bureaucracy, all in relation to the age-old conflict between man and nature. The title, which means “tigress” in Hindi, refers not only to the wandering animal at the centre of the film’s clashes but also the protagonist, forest officer Vidya Vincent (Vidya Balan). A taciturn government worker, Vidya’s fierceness shows itself in her astonishing resilience: determined to capture the man-eating tiger alive, she rails against her uncaring, opportunistic superiors and the local politicians who use the animal to incite villagers to violence. In the end, Vidya’s compassion bucks against an incendiary, bloodthirsty hunter who only wants the poor beast dead. Balan excels here with a subtle performance that avoids platitudinous girl-power poses. Underneath Vidya’s quiet exterior is a resolute refusal to cower to authority, and thus, when she hits a roadblock in her quest, the slightest crack in her composure feels shattering. Masurkar’s signature dark humour is in evidence in visual details: Vidya’s boss, for instance, has a gigantic photo of a tiger in his office, but is completely oblivious to the specificities of conservation work. But unlike with Newton, Masurkar is credited for co-writing the dialogue but not the full screenplay, and perhaps this is why Sherni lacks the mathematical exactness of Newton’s satire. In fact, the film operates much like the roaming tiger, meandering from political commentary to a study of women in a male-dominated field. These are important issues, but Sherni reiterates near-identical scenes of confrontation without delving into their causes, thus wasting the excellent cast of veteran character actors. Still, this is an engaging excursion into the trials and tribulations of environmental conservation, which rarely get fictionalised on screen. • Sherni is released on 18 June on Amazon Prime Video.",Sherni,FILM
"462 ","Scarlett Johansson criticises ‘hypersexualisation’ of Black Widow in Iron Man 2               ","Scarlett Johansson has spoken out against the sexualisation of Black Widow in Iron Man 2, the 2010 blockbuster in which her character first appeared in the Marvel Cinematic Universe series. Speaking in a pool interview in the run-up to the release of the standalone Black Widow film, Johansson said: “While [Iron Man 2] was really fun and had a lot of great moments in it, the character is so sexualised, you know? [She is] really talked about like she’s a piece of something, like a possession or a thing or whatever – like a piece of ass, really. And Tony even refers to her as something like that at one point … ‘I want some.’” Johansson appears to be referring to the scene in Iron Man 2 when, as Natalie Rushman, Black Widow meets Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) for the first time. After flicking through a series of pictures of Rushman, including one of the character in lingerie, Stark tells Gwyneth Paltrow’s Pepper Potts: “I want one.” (Potts earlier refers to Rushman as “a very expensive sexual harassment lawsuit if you keep ogling her”.) Johansson added: “Maybe at that time that actually felt like a compliment. You know what I mean? Because my thinking was different … My own self-worth was probably measured against that type of comment [but], like a lot of young women, you come into your own and you understand your own self-worth.” Johansson went on to say that “young girls are getting a much more positive message” and that “it’s been incredible to be a part of that shift and be able to come out the other side”. Johansson praised the “move away from the kind of hypersexualization of this character” in the new Black Widow film, which co-stars Florence Pugh and is directed by Cate Shortland. She said: “I’m a mom and my life is different. Obviously, 10 years have passed and things have happened and I have a much different, more evolved understanding of myself. As a woman, I’m in a different place in my life, you know?”",Scarlett Johansson,PERFORMER
"463 ","One in a Thousand review – Argentinian teen’s hoop dreams, hanging out and hoping","This is an LGBT urban pastoral from film-maker Clarisa Navas, set in a tough barrio in Corrientes province, north-eastern Argentina. Sofia Cabrera plays Iris, a teenage girl who appears to have been excluded from school – although that doesn’t make her lifestyle any more obviously aimless than all the people she’s hanging out with. Iris is obsessed with basketball and spends most of her days loafing around, shooting hoops, talking with her brother and cousins, and chatting with the neighbourhood kids, gay and straight. Then she chances across a charismatic older woman called Renata (Ana Carolina García), who has an elegantly wasted image; Renata has mysteriously been abroad for a while and apparently dances at a local club called Traumatic, where she appears to be on the fringe of sex work. Some are saying that she has HIV – although this may simply be spite. Iris and Renata are drawn to each other and soon they are in love. Navas conjures up a whole world in which there is apparently little or nothing to do but participate in an endless round of hanging out, hooking up, breaking up, gossiping and lying dreamily on a bed thinking about it all. She contrives many open-ended walk-and-walk travelling shots, in which Iris and Renata just lope around the neighbourhood, chatting and scouting locations in which they might kiss without being interrupted. Navas is clearly in command of a very distinctive, confident film-making language. This is clearly a story that means a lot to her personally, but I felt that the movie was spinning its wheels a little after a while; it is disconcerting that she relied on an act of violence to close the narrative. But this is engaging, intelligent film-making and Navas’s performers relax into the space that she creates for them. • One in a Thousand is released on 18 June on Mubi.",One in a Thousand,FILM
"464 ","Golden Globes: two members resign from ‘toxic’ Hollywood Foreign Press Association            ","Two members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), the body that organises the Golden Globes, have resigned, denouncing the organisation as “toxic” in a letter obtained by the LA Times. In their letter, Wenting Xu and Diederik van Hoogstraten said that “staying inside the association is no longer tenable for us”. They list a number of reasons, including that “the majority of the membership resists deep change”, new rules to improved diversity have been “watered down”, and that “fear of retribution, self-dealing, corruption and verbal abuse” are still central to the HFPA’s culture. They added: “The HFPA continues to accommodate a toxic environment that undermines professional journalism. The bullying of members by fellow members is left unquestioned and unpunished. The badgering of talent and publicists: ditto … many members continue to believe we are victims, an attitude that guarantees no self-reflection or change will occur.” Xu is a reporter for New York-based trade publication World Screen, while Van Hoogstraten is a producer and freelance contributor to a number of Dutch outlets including NRC Handelsblad and Het Financieele Dagblad, and is a former HFPA board member. The HPFA has been under fire since the LA Times ran an exposé on the eve of the 2021 Golden Globes, citing allegations of corruption and impropriety as well as the absence of any black members. The organisation was subsequently hit by an industry boycott and the cancellation of the TV broadcast of the 2022 Globes. High-profile figures, including Tom Cruise and Scarlett Johansson, have been outspoken in their criticism. The HFPA has struggled to form a coherent response, with its plans for reform receiving further criticism from influential industry groups such as Time’s Up. The LA Times reports that Xu and Van Hoogstraten have repeatedly complained to the HFPA, with one board member responding that Xu’s comments were a “hate campaign” and that she was “working … against us”. In their letter, Xu and Van Hoogstraten say they plan to set up “a transparent, professional and inclusive organisation for the current and next generations of reporters”.",Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA),OTHERS
"465 ","Dr Bird’s Advice for Sad Poets review – quirky teenage hero gets life lessons from a pigeon   ","Unhappy teenagers are each unhappy in their own way. But there is a movie template for the unhappiness of a certain kind of male of the species: that hypersensitive socially awkward outsider who sees right through the phoniness of the adult world and expresses himself with freakish maturity. Not wandering too far from the standard is 16-year-old James Whitman (Lucas Jade Zumann) the poet hero of this coming-of-age comedy with sad-serious bits. James has anxiety and depression, and he’s obsessed in a big way with his namesake, the poet Walt Whitman. The Dr Bird of the title is his imaginary psychiatrist, who he quirkily visualises as a pigeon (nicely voiced by Tom Wilkinson). The movie follows James as he searches for his older sister, who mysteriously disappeared after a blazing row with their dad Carl (Jason Isaacs), an angry navy veteran. The family dysfunction stuff is sensitively handled with some originality; Carl is nicknamed “the brute” by his wife, a frustrated artist, and the kids, who hold him responsible as the fount of all unhappiness in the family. The truth turns out to be a little more nuanced. Less interesting is the offbeat hunt for James’s sister, who he discovers has links with a cult. Cue a deeply unfunny Wes Anderson-ish sequence featuring David Arquette as a sleazy hippy cult leader surrounded by chanting acolytes. Director Yaniv Raz loads up on irritating stylistic touches: there’s a cowboy movie-style showdown James has with a kid who used to date his girlfriend Sophie (Taylor Russell); and the poster of Walt Whitman on his bedroom wall that comes alive. We don’t get to see so much as a scintilla of Sophie’s inner life. “I’m not some quirky character who exists to give you an epiphany,” she tells him. It’s a smart line but I’m not sure it’s true. Nor does the movie quite know how to handle James’s mental health: eccentric idiosyncrasy or Serious Issue? • Dr Bird’s Advice for Sad Poets is released on 21 June on digital platforms.",Dr Bird’s Advice for Sad Poets,FILM
"466 ","In the Heights review – a blast of sunshine, hope and hotpants","This adaptation of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s 2005 stage musical bursts on to the screen like a confetti cannon. Director Jon M Chu (Crazy Rich Asians) delivers a blast of sunshine, hope and hotpants. But unpeel the song-and-dance romance and escapism and there’s a socially engaged, issue-led drama under the sparkle and pizzazz. Of course it’s not unprecedented for superficially frivolous musicals to tackle serious issues: Cabaret explored the rise of fascism in Germany. Numerous Bollywood spectaculars have delved into the caste system, and West Side Story deals with the immigrant experience and gang-based tensions. It’s with the latter that In the Heights bears some similarities: both feature Latinx communities; both unfold on the streets of New York City. But while West Side Story is driven by conflict, at the core of In the Heights is a sentimental hug of neighbourhood unity – Washington Heights against the world, and the double-pronged assault of gentrification and discrimination. It’s from this, and from the engaging cast (Anthony Ramos is a particular delight; Olga Merediz single-handedly shifts the whole film up an emotional notch or 10), that the film derives its inviting warmth. Ramos plays Usnavi, the central character and the film’s narrator, a bodega worker who dreams of returning to his parents’ Dominican Republic homeland, but whose ties to Washington Heights – and in particular the lovely Vanessa (Melissa Barrera) – are hard to break. The messaging can be a little on-the-nose at times – a climactic electrical outtage gives the film the opportunity to assert that its characters are not, in fact, powerless. But perhaps a more potent political statement is the way that Christopher Scott’s choreography claims and owns every square inch of the block. Reclaim the streets (with fabulous shoes and glorious Latin dance routines)!",In the Heights,FILM

Luca, voiced by Room’s Jacob Tremblay, is a sea monster who longs to explore the world beyond the reef. He knows that once on land he will assume human form, but good kids like Luca don’t break the rules. Then he meets Alberto (Jack Dylan Grazer), an adolescent sea monster-turned-boy who has made a life on land. There’s kinship here with Finding Nemo and with Studio Ghibli’s Ponyo, both in the marine setting and in the fact that it plays to the younger end of the audience spectrum. But while Luca might lack some of the dizzying inventiveness that marks out top-tier Pixar, it’s packed to the gills with charm.",Luca,FILM

In common with his other films (Divine Intervention, The Time That Remains, among others), Suleiman appears in It Must Be Heaven as a droll, near-silent presence, bearing witness to the absurdities of the world around him. That world expands beyond Palestine; the film’s journey takes him to Paris and New York in search of funding for a movie that is deemed to be “not Palestinian enough”.

If anything, The Hitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard is even more obnoxious and lazy, with a screenplay that imposes a thankless “Mexican hellcat” cliche of a role on Salma Hayek, and which eschews jokes in favour of lots of shouty swearing. The dismal dialogue wouldn’t matter quite so much if at least the action sequences delivered a few thrills, but the whole thing is so shoddily put together it looks as though it was edited with a strimmer.

Higashida used his writing to answer the questions that the neurotypical world might have about the autistic experience. Jerry Rothwell’s approach to bringing the book to the screen is sensitive and creative, a sometimes expressionistic, sensually eloquent riff on the source material that draws in the voices of other autistic young people and their carers, and which continues the conversation that Higashida’s work initiated. The voices of neurodivergent people, the film explains, might not be articulated in spoken language: in India, Amrit finds her means of expression through drawing; in Arlington, Virginia, best friends Emma Budway and Ben McGann communicate through alphabet boards. Meanwhile, Rothwell uses the language of cinema – macro lens closeups, distortion, off-kilter framing and an evocative blend of sound design and score – to convey the autistic experience of the world.",The Reason I Jump,FILM
"471 ","Tyger Tyger review – spaced-out apocalypse chic in pandemic thriller                          ","Sometimes a film comes along that reminds you why you shouldn’t go to Coachella, Burning Man or any kind of rave-adjacent event filled with Gen Z kids or millennials. Not that this dystopian, near-future road movie is actually set during a music festival. It’s more like the sort of fare that might be projected in a movie tent at such an event, where people coming down off a bad dose of Molly lie about hoping the throbbing will stop soon. Unfortunately, this movie is the throbbing. The ostensible plot concerns some kind of pandemic knocking about (get ready for scads of movies with this theme coming out over the next few years) and rangy protagonist Blake (Sam Quartin) is worried she may have been infected by her greasy boyfriend Cole (Max Madsen). Nevertheless, her plan is to rob a drugstore to liberate a life-saving drug and pass it on to some kind of underground health maintenance organisation to save other people’s lives – as if Occupy ran Obamacare, maybe. But Cole ditches her and she’s left with a young friend named Bobby (Nekhebet Kum Juch) who lost her voice. Blake and Bobby eventually meet up with a junkie named Luke (Dylan Sprouse), who happened to be in the store when they were robbing it; for no very comprehensible reason, they kidnap Luke and drag him with them to a desert commune where more spaced-out young folk are loafing around and avoiding the apocalypse. Although several characters are meant to be either smackheads or sick, they all look picturesquely skeevy, like a heroin-chic fashion spread back in the 90s. This all might have been entertaining in an on-trend retro way if the acting weren’t so dismally poor, the dialogue so banal, and the whole thing so listlessly dull as it sputters towards an outrageously dumb Usual Suspects-style twist ending. Also, the film-makers are lucky poor old William Blake’s work is out of copyright, otherwise his heirs (were any to be found) would have a good reason to sue. • Tyger Tyger is released on 28 June on digital platforms.",Tyger Tyger,FILM
"472 ","Unearth review – fracking horror finds something nasty under the cornfield                    ","If HP Lovecraft had joined Extinction Rebellion, this is the kind of idea he might have come up with: a cautionary horror story about fracking, which disguises itself as a 70s ensemble drama before erupting into something altogether ickier. While Terrence Malick loved filming American cornfields at the hallowed “magic hour”, this awkward hybrid prefers loitering at what you might call “morbid hour”, with Korean cinematographer Eun-ah Lee bathing everything in sallow, deathly light. The blight beneath everyone’s feet is creeping into their hearts. Set in rural Pennsylvania, Unearth is a tale of two houses: the Lomacks and the Dolans. Beer-chugging divorcee dad George Lomack (Marc Blucas) is struggling to provide for his two daughters with a failing auto-mechanic business; dollar signs light up in his eyes when a gas-extraction outfit called Patriot Exploration comes calling with an offer for his land. This is much to the horror of Kathryn Dolan (Adrienne Barbeau, on fearsome form), matriarch of the neighbouring clan, who is fighting to keep her land productive, and whose photographer daughter Christina (Allison McAtee) likes blowing off some steam amid the corncobs with pent-up George. The film takes considerable care delving into these dynastic undercurrents, complete with a doomy biblical undertow. “If you make a tree good, its fruit will be good. You make a tree bad, its fruit’s gonna be bad,” augurs Kathryn. So makes it all the more jarring when Unearth explodes with little warning into full-on suppurating-wound, tendril-spouting eco horror for the final 20 minutes. No real explanation is apparently deemed necessary of the infection vector at hand: evil fracking. Directors John C Lyons and Dorota Swies go at the transition with gusto, including a highly disturbing episode featuring a toddler, and a nauseating demise for Barbeau worthy of her former husband, John Carpenter. But completely dropping the diligent previous character work, it becomes a directionless mess, flapping rampages through arable fields. Like the drilling operation, this was a script in sore need of a clean-up operation. • Unearth is available on digital platforms on 28 June.",Unearth,FILM
"473 ","Circumstantial Pleasures review – watchable weirdness and Covid prophecy                      ","Lewis Klahr is an American artist, collagist and animator who here presents a watchably weird curation of six short pieces made between 2013 and 2019. He’s cutting and pasting images from magazines and comic-books that float, bounce and pinball around the screen. The faces of Xi, Trump and Kim Jong-un will shuffle in and out of the frame like something by Terry Gilliam, and all to an accompaniment of experimental music by Daniel Rosenboom, Tom Recchion and Scott Walker; the latter’s 2012 album Bish Bosch is used, with its strident lyrics such as: “I’ve severed my reeking gonads and fed them to your shrunken face!” Klahr’s images are often about capitalism and alienation and it’s notable how they appear to prophesy the Covid lockdown, especially the first film, Capitalist Roaders, with its images of stymied travel, scrunched and folded banknotes and people in medical masks. Perhaps the point of capitalism was that it was supposed to be internationally unfettered. In more than one film, Klahr uses the disturbing picture of the jihadi gunman who shot dead the Russian ambassador to Turkey at an Ankara art exhibition in 2016. Perhaps he couldn’t resist this image of the ultimate situationist art nightmare. Not all the films are animations. In one, High Rise, Klahr uses a single digital video shot from a train approaching Beijing showing the eerie sci-fi megacity landscape of tall buildings. It is truly desolate. Repeatedly, Klahr appears to be creating a microcircuitry of repeating patterns. And their meaning? Perhaps there is none, or none that springs easily to mind. This could just be the endlessly ramifying texture of modern life, or perhaps the texture of our media consumption of this modern life. It is opaque, sometimes eccentrically comic, but intriguing. • Circumstantial Pleasures is on Mubi from 23 June.",Circumstantial Pleasures,FILM
"474 ","Fatima review – holy mother miracle retold with unbreakable faith                             ","Picking fault with faith films on dramatic grounds is like objecting to explicit sex scenes for being “boring”. Believers may well be swept away by this glossy account of the 1917 Miracle of the Sun in Fátima, Portugal – witnessed by 30,000 people and already the subject of feature films in 1952 and 2009. But given the inherent lack of drama in the kind of unbreakable faith on display here, anyone wishing to tell the story needs to work much harder than this laboured treatment to wring any nuance, conflict or indeed true sublimity from it. To be fair, director Marco Pontecorvo – son of The Battle of Algiers’ Gillo – doesn’t disgrace himself on the latter front. There’s an undeniable sacred frisson as Mediterreanean winds caress the olive trees and invisible feet flatten the saltgrass, as the Virgin Mary first visits three young shepherds Lúcia, Jacinta and Francisco, and anoints them as her messengers. The trio quickly attract followers among a war-weary populace eager for deliverance. But others think Lucia (Stephanie Gil) is just seeking attention, including the rational-minded mayor, eager to get a public order nightmare under control, and her own devout mother Maria Rosa (Lúcia Moniz), worried her daughter’s presumptuousness will anger Him upstairs. The gathering Catholic freight train is recounted in flashback, as Harvey Keitel’s author puts up some token scepticism years later to the now Sister Lúcia – played with transfixing steadiness by Sônia Braga and who, in real life, died aged 97 in 2005. One question he poses her is why Mary would ask three young children to suffer. Indeed, insisting she knows what’s best for them, and that they keep the most challenging of her prophecies to themselves – including that two of them will die young – the Holy Mother comes across here a bit like the ultimate gaslighting parent. “Faith begins on the edges of understanding,” is the sister’s response. In truth. Fatima is too secure in its faith to subtly probe such mysteries. Pontecorvo shoots the film radiantly – including a quick CGI excursion to hell – but there is something spiritually complacent about his slickness.

What is on this buff oilman’s mind, though, is that he has just been put on extended leave following an industrial accident. His secret soon spills too, and Jack is so desperate to please his wife that he ignores safari-park protocol and lets them get too close to the fauna: a female rhinoceros and calf. “Wait, we shouldn’t be getting between them, right?” says Billy, a brief lapse into sensible ideas. One upended van later, with Jack’s leg gored, no mobile phone reception or water, and diabetic Lauren’s insulin levels running on empty, the Halseys find themselves in a world of hurt. If you can accept the western-centric point of view, all the ingredients are here for a dusty, merciless thriller tussling with nature in tooth and claw. But despite the horrific circumstances, Endangered Species remains inexplicably stuck in the perky comic register of a US sitcom. When it’s not attending to their trite family issues – Jack’s unease with his son’s homosexuality, plus Jack’s uptight control freakery in general – there is the Miss World-level lip service to Global Problems. “We did a project about cobalt mining in the Congo for cellphone batteries. Do you know how much violence there is, corruption, child labour?” says Noah to Billy, his musings floating out over the splendour of the veldt. A murderous CGI leopard, speaking for all of us, thankfully interrupts this conversation. A third act swerve in which man proves to be the most dangerous animal of all finally adds some real stakes and makes the realpolitik lectures finally click, thanks largely to a devilish turn from Jerry O’Connell. But there is something fundamentally naive and pious about this film. Even the final takeaway declaration on poaching oddly quotes the director MJ Bassett herself (though she did start her career as a wildlife photographer). Maybe the all-female anti-poaching squad briefly featured – based on real-life teams at work now – would have been a better prism through which to view the film’s ideas. • Endangered Species is available on digital platforms on 28 June.",Endangered Species,FILM
"476 ","Sing, Freetown review – astonishing study of creative pain and pride in Sierra Leone","Cinema is often connected to dreams and triumphs, and yet failure can make for a far more arresting subject. This astonishing documentary both demythologises the creative process and captures a tortuous artistic collaboration full of human messiness and complexity. With an evocative opening image of a man paddling a small boat towards the shore, Sing, Freetown is about returning, both physically and metaphorically. The image recalls the history of Sierra Leone as a territory where liberated Africans resettled after the slave trade was outlawed. Bafta- and Emmy-winning journalist Sorious Samura is also on his own odyssey. Weary of reporting on the poverty and civil unrest in Africa, Samura has come back to Sierra Leone, his homeland, to create a theatre piece that is positive about the nation’s pride and its rich history. Joining him is Charlie Haffner, Samura’s friend, mentor and founding figure of modern Sierra Leonean theatre. The pair encounter funding difficulties and resistance from the government. These are to be expected; what they do not predict is how the project would irretrievably puncture their relationship. Making art on the postcolonial margins is complicated. Logistical issues aside, Samura and Haffner feel not just their own insecurities heavily on their shoulders but also centuries of collective angst, guilt and hurt. The film acutely captures this intellectual and emotional turmoil: a particularly searing moment is when Samura speaks to the camera, as if in confession, about how his journalism is perhaps complicit in serving up Africa’s traumas to the consumption of the white gaze. Haffner bluntly says that his former student only makes documentaries for white people, even as he himself suffers from the spectre of a personal tragedy. All of this might sound like heavy stuff, but Sing, Freetown is a dynamic film with a deep understanding of the country’s rhythm, as well as the ebb and flow of the two men’s rapport. This is a hugely special, rewarding documentary whose ending manages to encompass both victory and loss. • Sing, Freetown is released on 25 June in cinemas.","Sing, Freetown",FILM
"477 ","Senior Moment review – William Shatner has still got it at 90                                 ","The basic terribleness of this film is beside the point. Everything in this film, in fact, is beside the point, save for the fact that it stars the genetic miracle of the modern age, the all-time winner of the Dorian Gray award for looking younger than your age, more impressive even than Paul Rudd … the legendary William Shatner. Shatner plays Victor Martin, a roguish old Viagra-popping womaniser who loses his driving licence after a prang. He winds up having to take the bus, where he meets-cute with a lovely lady close to his age range, cafe owner Caroline Summers, played by Jean Smart (last seen as Kate Winslet’s mum in TV’s Mare of Easttown). We actually hear what age Shatner’s character is supposed to be: 72. Fair enough. Shatner could pass for younger. But the staggering fact is he is 90. And you can easily spend the entire film hissing to yourself as you gaze awestruck at his beaming, slightly waxy but very clear face: “Ninety! He is 90! Is it special effects? Work done? A pact with Satan?” There is a fair bit of cringey stuff here, especially the gruesome opening scene in which Victor washes his beloved sports car and murmurs: “You’re a dirty girl … ” But it has to be said that sentimental regard for the great Starfleet captain turned admiral compels a certain amount of loyalty to this ridiculous nonsense. And, in fact, Shatner plays all the absurd comedy gamely enough, as indeed does Smart. The great Portuguese auteur Manoel de Oliveira continued making films until his late 90s. It could well be that Shatner will do the same. Why not a new Star Trek? • Senior Moment is released on 28 June on digital platforms",Senior Moment,FILM
"478 ","Edgar Wright and Kenneth Branagh to premiere latest at Toronto film festival                  ","New films from Kenneth Branagh and Edgar Wright have been announced as part of this year’s Toronto film festival. The festival, which is typically seen as a major launchpad for films aiming for Oscars, will return to an in-person iteration this year after last year’s was mostly online as a result of the pandemic. Branagh’s new film Belfast, which he directed and wrote, is a semi-autobiographical tale about a working-class family in the late 60s starring Jamie Dornan and Judi Dench. “It’s about coming home – a dramatic journey of excitement, emotion and humour,” Branagh said. Wright’s eagerly anticipated thriller Last Night in Soho is the story of a young woman who encounters a portal that takes her to 1960s London. It stars Anya Taylor-Joy, Thomasin McKenzie and the late Diana Rigg. “I always like to gravitate towards making a film in genres I miss, and there’s a certain type of psychological horror film that you got more in the 60s and 70s that have something of an operatic nature,” Wright said to Empire. “I’m using that kind of visual grammar.” The two films were announced as part of a limited initial lineup consisting of just nine titles. Other premieres include The Starling, a drama starring Melissa McCarthy, and Lakewood, a thriller starring Naomi Watts. There will also be documentaries about the singers Dionne Warwick and Alanis Morissette. While in-person screenings and events will return, a digital component will remain for those unable to physically attend. “We are confident in our planning for a return to in-person screenings as part of Tiff as both the province and country accelerate vaccination rollout,” said Peter Nord, the festival’s consultative partner on health and safety for the pandemic. “Canada’s first-dose immunization rate has surpassed the US, and recently reached the best rates in the world.” Next month sees a return for the Cannes film festival with major premieres including Wes Anderson’s The French Dispatch and Sean Penn’s Flag Day while this year’s Venice film festival is set to see the first screening of Denis Villeneuve’s Dune.",Edgar Wright and Kenneth Branagh,FILM-CREW
"479 ","Sweat review – the loneliness of the social media influencer                                  ","In theory, it should be possible to create a drama about a social media influencer and motivational fitness celebrity that isn’t all about the hidden loneliness and shame of her shallow existence. It should be possible to show such a person being a huge hit in public and perfectly content in private. But this movie from Poland-based Swedish director Magnus von Horn pretty much goes for route one, and despite some interesting touches, it promises much more in terms of shock and character insight than it ever really delivers, with some contrived and unconvincing plot transitions. Sylwia (Magdalena Koleśnik) has 600,000 followers for the Instagram account on which she obsessively posts, detailing every aspect of her day as a successful single woman, running colossally popular fitness events with her beefcake male assistant Klaudiusz (Julian Świeżewski). He clearly has a major thing for her, though at one crucial moment he shows a very implausible kind of restraint. She is living in a sleek apartment with her adorable dog, Jackson; there’s a new fitness DVD out and everything seems to be going well. But she’s recently gone viral with a video in which she tearfully confessed to wretchedness at not having a boyfriend and, far from praising her emotional honesty or caring for her mental health, Sylwia’s sponsors are hinting this is a downer and they may cancel her contract. To make things worse, Sylwia has a creepy stalker hanging out outside the apartment block and it is the birthday of her widowed mum Basia (Aleksandra Konieczna), who is hosting a party at which all the family are invited, including Sylwia’s beamingly pregnant cousin. There are some good scenes in the mix here: particularly when an old schoolfriend of Sylwia bumps into her at the mall and starts miserably confessing the grim things that are happening in her life, so different, of course, from Sylwia’s ostensible glamorous success. But this film isn’t really sure where it’s taking us and how, or if, it wants to surprise us, and the key scene with Klaudiusz doesn’t work. • Sweat is released on 25 June in cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema",Sweat,FILM
"480 ","The Man Standing Next review – a thrilling scramble for political power in 70s South Korea    ","This is a suspenseful but fiendishly complex political thriller from South Korea, which was the country’s submission for best international film for the most recent Oscars, though it didn’t make the final five shortlist. That doesn’t necessarily mean it’s not a solid film, but viewers whose introduction to Korean cinema was director Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite, which rightly won all the big prizes the year before, should be warned not to expect anything quite as audacious or accessible here. In fact, director Woo Min-ho’s drama feels aimed more at a domestic audience, covering as it does the tense days in 1979 when a military coup and an assassination determined who would ultimately come to power. Although based on actual events, a disclaimer at the beginning warns that some dramatic licence has been taken to tell the story, which was in turn based on a novel. At the centre of the story is President Park (played by Lee Sung-min), who has been the top dog for 18 years. His de facto second in command is the head of the Korean CIA, Kim Gyu-pyeong (Lee Byung-hun, excellent), a narrow-faced civil servant who shuttles diplomatically between Seoul and Washington DC, where another compatriot, Park Yong-gak (Kwak Do-won), is testifying before a US congressional committee and threatening to publish a memoir that will spill the beans about corruption in the highest ranks of the government. That’s just the start of a complex quadrille of alliances and betrayals, performed mostly in darkened, panelled rooms, as the soundtrack provides a constant percussive beat spelling doom for several figures. There’s a long wait until something really meaty happens, in every sense, but the climactic killing in a restaurant, complete with spluttering arteries and swooping camerawork, is just about worth the wait. • The Man Standing Next is released on 25 June in virtual cinemas.",The Man Standing Next,FILM
"481 ","Michael B Jordan renames rum after accusations of cultural appropriation                      ","Michael B Jordan has issued an apology, in the fallout from his announcement over the weekend that he was launching a line of rums called J’Ouvert. The term signals the start of carnival in the Caribbean and is a cornerstone of tradition in Trinidad and Tobago; Jordan’s use of the word was felt by many to be cultural appropriation. Critics were particularly angered by the line in Jordan’s trademark filing that claimed the term has “no meaning in a foreign language”. An online petition to stop the trademark had already topped 12,000 signatures and the government of the islands also expressed deep concern over the plan. Singer Nicki Minaj, who comes from Trinidad, urged Jordan to change the “offensive” name on Tuesday; later that day Jordan posted an apology on Instagram Stories. “I just wanna say on behalf of myself &amp; my partners, our intention was never to offend or hurt a culture (we love &amp; respect) &amp; hoped to celebrate &amp; shine a positive light on,” he wrote. “Last few days has been a lot of listening. A lot of learning &amp; engaging in countless community conversations ...” “We hear you. I hear you &amp; want to be clear that we are in the process of renaming. We sincerely apologize &amp; look forward to introducing a brand we can all be proud of.” The term “J’Ouvert” originates from the French for daybreak; its relationship with the start of carnival in the Caribbean dates back to the 1800s. At the start of the week, the minister of trade and industry, Paula Gopee-Scoon, told Trinidad and Tobago Newsday the intellectual property implications of the filing were “of extreme concern”.",Michael B Jordan,PERFORMER

The film’s writer, Callie Khouri, told the Hollywood Reporter at a 30th anniversary screening that the project was in its “very early stages”. “We’ve got a book and we’ve got music but because of the pandemic, we haven’t all been together in a very, very long time. So, it’s still in its nascent stages, but it’s very promising.” Khouri, who won an Oscar for best original screenplay for the film, added that the musical will be “a completely different animal” from the film, which was directed by Ridley Scott, and that she had previously been reluctant to rework the movie. “There have been queries over the years, but I didn’t really want to see it. I just felt like [the film-makers] nailed it.” The film tells the story of two women who ditch their frustrating lives to go on a road trip which then turns desperate after Louise (Sarandon) kills a man who attempts to rape Thelma (Davis). It was a commercial success on its release and was nominated for six Oscars (with Khouri the only winner). In the years since, its feminist credentials have ensured it remains a cultural touchstone. According to the Hollywood Reporter, performer-playwright Halley Feiffer is writing the script for the musical, and singer-songwriter Neko Case will provide original songs, with Trip Cullman (a regular collaborator with Feiffer) due to direct.",Thelma & Louise,FILM
"483 ","The Filmmaker’s House review – a microcosm of British society pops round for tea              ","“I’m not bloody interested in serial killers, Rachel; I’m interested in ordinary human beings,” sighs veteran documentary-maker Marc Isaacs on a Skype call to his producer, who tells him programmers are only interested in sensationalist themes nowadays. Isaacs sticks to his guns. As the title implies, this inventive but flawed effort barely leaves his London terrace home. What’s less obvious, at least initially, is whether it is documentary or fiction. The eventual answer is a bit of both. Having chronicled so many aspects of Britishness in his documentary career, Isaacs contrives a sort of microcosmic state of our multicultural nation here: a gentle clash of cultural attitudes and boundaries. The dramatis personae are craftily assembled. There is a Slovakian homeless man, Mikel, whose request for a drink becomes an extended stay. Isaacs’ Colombian cleaner, Nery, who has recently lost her mother, happens to be in that day. As does his builder Keith, a textbook old, white, overweight Englishman with a passion for football and a dodgy heart. By “coincidence”, just as Nery is dealing with the cat bringing a pigeon into the house, Isaacs’ niqab-wearing Pakistani neighbour, Zara, pops round with a gift of food during Ramadan. The conversations and interactions between these people are revealing and entertaining. Their contrasting attitudes towards home, hospitality and family are thought-provoking. But there is a “structured reality” feel to proceedings which leaves us doubting their authenticity. (No serial killers turn up, but there is a brush with mortality.) These people appear to be non-actors playing themselves, but not always convincingly. This is especially true of Zara, whose readiness to explain and criticise her own culture feels implausible. Isaacs himself is a playful, self-deprecating presence, but just as the story falls between stools of fact and fiction, so his own positions as generous host, privileged employer and dispassionate observer make for a certain awkwardness. It doesn’t quite come off, but it’s a laudable attempt. • The Filmmaker’s House is released on 25 June in cinemas and on digital platforms.",The Filmmaker’s House,FILM
"484 ","Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds review – delightfully retro canine capers                 ","This animated feature, executed mainly with 3D CGI rendering, offers a new, feature-length version of the novel The Three Musketeers but, as the title suggests, with dogs playing the leads. Yet the film is only partly based on the narrative DNA of Alexandre Dumas’ original book. The rest derives from the vintage 80s cartoon series Dogtanian, created by a Spanish production company, which told pretty much the same story but with shonkier, though immensely charming, traditional cel animation. That series was so endearing partly because the characters were pleasingly expressive in design terms, and largely faithful to the book’s iconic original characters. The Snoopy-like Dogtanian (voiced here by Tomás Ayuso), for example, a character design that persists from the series through to this film, is the talking beagle character at the story’s heart, and is recognisably similar in personality to the ingenuous, chivalrous hero in Dumas’ book. And the dog-breed characteristics of the three other Muskehounds map satisfyingly on to the original characters: effete, couplet-rapping Aramis is depicted as a foppish spaniel. Dogtanian’s love interest, Juliette (Karina Piper) is a lithe, golden coloured Afghan, the king a King Charles spaniel, and so on. This breed/species stereotyping extends throughout the Dogtanian universe with supporting villain Milady being incarnated as a slinky Siamese cat, transformed here into an ace sword fighter in a slinky cat’s catsuit, as it were, just to make her a little more empowered than the simpering, begowned schemer of the 1980s version. And here, Dogtanian’s duplicitous rodent sidekick, Pip, however, is somehow more grating and repellent, maybe because of the voice casting or the fact that he anachronistically moonwalks when excited. As with so much anthropomorphic animation, nothing explains why some species can walk upright, talk and rule the world while others, particularly horses, are still roughly the same as our real-world horses. The designs for the backgrounds in the current film perhaps lack some of the finesse of the character work, but are serviceable. All in all, there’s something delightfully retro about the whole package, particularly as it sticks doggedly, in every sense, to the raw fundamentals of Dumas’ story. • Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds is in cinemas from 25 June.",Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds,FILM
"485 ","Bare review – naked dance film conceals more than it reveals                                  ","While the sight of naked flesh has always been a sensitive area in cinema history, male frontal nudity elicits especially visceral responses. In a still male-dominated industry, it is woefully normal for female bodies to be seen as mere objects of desire. In contrast, a penis on screen still triggers shock, discomfort and even a vulnerability that some viewers, along with censors, find hard to confront. Through chronicling the months-long rehearsals of a modern dance piece called Anima Ardens, for which every male dancer performs in the nude, Aleksandr M Vinogradov’s documentary aims to remove the taboos attached to the male form. Bare could have been radical, or at least intriguing, but it really is dull. This is partly due to the abstract nature of dance director Thierry Smits’ work. With an elusive ideal of masculinity in mind, he asks the dancers to perform like beasts and emphasises unsophisticated movements. At times, the troupe clearly feel frustrated, as if the piece exists in chunks rather than an emotional whole. The film’s structure is similarly unfocused. Beautiful shots of the dancers’ naked bodies contorting into abstract shapes are punctuated with millisecond-long inserts of words such as “MASCULINITY”, “WEAKNESS” and “666”, flashing on a blank screen, and snippets of classical paintings that depict male nudity. Such hollow flourishes undermine the arresting physicality of the dancers’ movements. The film’s most uncomfortable moment, however, has nothing to do with nudity. In an early audition, a dancer questions the presence of the camera and shows concerns about being filmed naked. Only then does Smits explain that a documentary is being made. That this fact was not disclosed beforehand is particularly questionable. Ironically enough, a filmed performance of Smits’ piece, also directed by Vinogradov, is available for free on Vimeo; if anything, it’s a more illuminating and poetic work on the male form. • Bare is released on 28 June on digital platforms.",Bare,FILM
"486 ","Ultraviolence review – still no justice in follow-up doc on deaths in UK police custody       ","Twenty years in the making, Ken Fero’s Ultraviolence is the follow-up to Injustice from 2001, a documentary that is the most important British nonfiction film of my professional lifetime: a radical, passionate work about the ongoing scandal and tragedy of deaths in UK police custody, largely of black men. That film challenged the consensus and earned Fero and his co-director Tariq Mehmood nothing but obstruction from the authorities. The police federation threatened him with writs and the terrestrial broadcasters nervously shied away. Nowadays, it is precisely these establishment figures who have learned to make blandly respectful noises at the mention of Black Lives Matter and George Floyd. But for decades, Fero has been telling them that it’s been happening right here, in the UK, under their noses. Between 1969 and 1999, a thousand people died in police custody without prosecution, and the situation has carried on in the 21st century. Injustice talked about the heartwrenching cases of Paul Coker, Christopher Alder and many more: black men whose initial arrest on some minor matter of disorder spiralled into ugly violence, brutal subjection techniques, death and cover-up within the walls of the police station. Fero has here given us an update: grimly, it is a case of more of the same: more deaths, more protests, more waffle from the Independent Office for Police Conduct, more press conferences, more stonewalling that leads the angry grieving families up endless flights of the Escher staircase. Now, the film itself is undoubtedly a bit raw and rough round the edges: it does not have the smooth gloss of a bigger budget film on a safer subject. In its way, Ultraviolence is protest cinema, underground cinema, with big rhetorical gestures and Godardian intertitles that come straight from the 1960s. And on a personal level, I can’t sign up to George Galloway as an expert witness in the way this film does. But the new video footage Fero now has, taken from police station CCTV, is horrifying.

"487 ","Sweat review – behind the scenes of the Insta influencer                                      ","We’re used to seeing social media stars from a particular vantage point: the ring-lit, face-on front camera of their mobile phones. Swedish writer-director Magnus von Horn’s shrewd second feature, about a fictional Polish fitness influencer, Sylwia (Magdalena Koleśnik), constantly readjusts its angle. Michal Dymek’s frenetic, often handheld camera examines Sylwia in extreme closeup, looking at her sideways and tracking her from behind. She is beautiful, adored and alone. She doesn’t have friends or sex or “eat cake”. Yet the film is not a straightforward send-up; it shows compassion for Sylwia and her search for self-definition – for her loneliness and her labour, its drudgery and its physical strain. Von Horn understands the gap between Sylwia’s authenticity online – mediated through the safety of a screen – and the intimacy her followers feel entitled to in real life. After a video post in which she cries about being single goes viral, an old classmate opens up to her about a miscarriage, while a middle-aged man, Rysiek (Tomasz Orpinski), stalks her outside her apartment.

"488 ","Triumph review – RJ Mitte grapples with sporting ambition in the wrestling ring               ","With actors with disabilities often confined to supporting roles, Triumph could have been a breath of fresh air. Centring on the rarely seen athletic journey of a character with a motor disorder, this underdog, coming-of-age sports movie has a big heart but lacks the competency to execute its aspirational premise. Mike (RJ Mitte) is a handsome high school freshman with a particularly disarming smile. He dreams of joining the wrestling team; however, because he has cerebral palsy, the obstacles are numerous. Not only does Mike endure jeers and bullying from other students, his caring but overly protective father also attempts to dissuade him from participating in organised sports. In the face of such hurdles, Mike fortunately has the unwavering support of the tough-but-fair Coach Cutting (Terrence Howard) and his new best friend/star athlete Jeff (Colton Haynes). With each arduous session of training, Mike not only grows as an athlete but also acquires timeless life lessons. Inspired by the teenage years of screenwriter Michael D Coffey, who grew up with cerebral palsy, the film does strive for authenticity, especially in terms of casting. Best known for playing Walter White Jr in Breaking Bad, Mitte has the condition himself, and infuses a rather thinly written character with a lot of tenacity and charisma. In fact, though based on truth, the story feels more like a sports film checklist, restlessly jumping from one cliche to another with little emotional weight. In contrast to Mitte’s committed performance, Howard pretty much phones it in with a near monotonous line reading; the cinematography is also particularly distracting, with a penchant for a halo-like effect that obscures the characters’ faces and proves especially ill-suited during wrestling sequences where the athletes’ bodies become blurry rather than powerful. This might work as an OK family-friendly watch, but good intentions are not enough to make a good movie. • Triumph is released on 28 June on digital platforms.",Triumph,FILM
"489 ","Sparkling: The Story of Champagne review – a fine aperitif for the summer                     ","Irish film producer and distribution executive Frank Mannion makes a genial host and guide to this polished survey of the highest of high-end sparkling wines; it’s entertaining in itself to watch Mannion gulping down giant goblets of the vintage under the guise of interviewing the heads of various champagne houses. There’s very much a wine-tour atmosphere to this documentary, particularly in the first half as Mannion wanders from one vineyard HQ to another, most of them located in gleaming perfume-factory type cubes perched oddly in the French countryside. If you ever thought champagnes were pretty much the same, whatever the label, well, this parade of beautifully turned-out old school champagne-makers will put you straight on the difference between Veuve Cliquot, Pol Roger, Bollinger, and the rest. In the middle section, Mannion’s attention turns to the beverage’s successful attempts to market itself internationally – “Champagne Charlie”, AKA Charles Heidsieck of Piper Heidsieck renown, appears to be the key figure here – as well as the way champagne has smartly inserted itself into top-end entertainment and sporting events, from James Bond to Wimbledon, to keep its glamour ratings high. In the final third, the focus changes to British attempts to get into the sparkling wine game; and if Mannion throughout is generally happy to let business owners do their marketing spiel at considerable length, in this last bit it goes into overdrive: it’s practically a longform advert for English sparkling wine estates such as Bolney, Wiston and Hush Heath. And although the “B” word – Brexit – doesn’t get a mention, there’s still an edge to the jolly home counties joshing of the French wine-makers in the British gun sights over who actually invented the stuff. (Slightly less jolly is the chuckling over global heating that may give British vintners a bit of assistance over the next few years.) Be that as it may, this is a warm-hearted, pleasant film, full of enthusiasm for its subject; a fine aperitif for the summer. • Sparkling: The Story of Champagne is released on 25 June in cinemas.",Sparkling: The Story of Champagne,FILM

"492 ","Fatima review – miracle movie plays down the transcendence                                    ","“Not everything unexplainable is necessarily transcendent,” insists Professor Nichols (Harvey Keitel), an atheist doing research for his latest book. “I can only give you my testimony,” replies Sônia Braga’s Sister Lúcia. Marco Pontecorvo’s gentle historical drama takes the real-life Portuguese nun’s account of the Miracle of the Sun in 1917 as its inspiration. Against the backdrop of the first world war, he focuses on the perspectives of 10-year-old Lúcia dos Santos (Stephanie Gil) and her younger cousins Francisco (Jorge Lamelas) and Jacinta (Alejandra Howard), who claim they have been visited by the “Angel of Peace” (Joana Ribeiro) in their hometown of Fátima. Lúcia is treated with scepticism by those around her, including her mother, Maria (Lúcia Moniz), and the town’s secular mayor (Goran Visnjic). Most of the film takes place in sepia-tinged flashback, which creates an atmosphere of dour sobriety instead of evoking any sort of divine radiance. Pontecorvo seems particularly interested in conveying the gravitas of Lúcia’s spiritual burden, which is anchored by Gil, who is full of quiet intensity and impressive conviction.",Fatima,FILM
"493 ","Fast & Furious 9 review – Vin Diesel back at the wheel of an overheated vehicle               ","Vin Diesel’s street racer turned special agent Dominic Toretto has declared he’s “not on call any more”, but with Charlize Theron’s cyberterrorist Cipher still at large, and in pursuit of a mysterious satellite device with the ability to “reboot the world order”, he might not have much of a choice. Worse still, his estranged little brother, Jakob (John Cena, “the useless one” to Dom’s golden boy), has teamed up with self-declared “spoiled rich prick” Otto (Thue Ersted Rasmussen) and is after the device too. Grainy flashbacks to their father’s death in 1989 create context for their bitter rivalry. Prior acquaintance with the eight previous instalments of this colossal action movie franchise isn’t necessary for enjoyment of this one – the film’s muscle cars and maximalist approach continue to serve it well. A set piece in the fictional Central American country of Montequinto, involving exploding landmines and an unlikely voyage across a rickety rope bridge, is a wild ride, but subsequent car chases in London, Edinburgh and Tokyo provide diminishing returns, stalling the almost two-and-a-half-hour running time. There’s a tongue-in-cheek attitude towards the silliness of the series’ death- (and logic- and gravity-) defying stunts. “How are you still alive?!” gawps tech whiz Tej (Ludacris) as buddy Roman (Tyrese Gibson) emerges jelly-legged from a car wreck. It’s a question I’d also like to ask after their trip to space in a modified Pontiac Fiero.",Fast & Furious 9,FILM
"494 ","Witch Hunt review – a downright offensive attempt at political horror                         ","An unfortunate effect of Jordan Peele’s masterly Get Out is the recent slew of horror flicks that have also attempted to double as explicit social commentary, yet end up either ineffective or tone-deaf. The slavery horror Antebellum is a prime example, as is the cringey trailer for the forthcoming Karen. And now we have this extremely clumsy film that hinges on the premise of a modern, dystopian US where magic exists but is outlawed. The film opens with the literal and metaphorical definitions of “witch-hunt” being typed across a blank screen, so all hopes of subtlety fly out the window. The story explores a young girl’s growing pains amid the legal and social persecution of witches. High schooler Claire (Gideon Adlon) tries to fit in with her prejudiced friends while hiding her own fearful secret: her mother is a part of an Underground Railroad-like system that helps the witches cross into Mexico for asylum. Initially resentful of the operation, Claire confronts her own intolerance after developing a friendship with two orphaned young witches whose mother is burned at the stake. Like a lot of low-budget horror movies, the VFX aren’t great; this would not necessarily be a problem if the film had crafted an atmosphere of actual suspense. Instead, random horror elements – jump scares and the like – are inserted into a story that would have worked better as a thriller. The political commentary is on even shakier ground: the film appropriates images of real-life oppression against people of colour, such as border patrol buses taking the undocumented to detention centres, but the witches are invariably white women – it is not only careless but downright offensive. Though examining how women’s bodies are controlled and surveilled by the state – there’s a scene where Claire is subjected to a medical examination for witch moles – such points ring grossly hollow. All in all, this is a horror that’s neither clever nor scary. • Witch Hunt is released on 5 July on digital platforms.",Witch Hunt,FILM
"495 ","Lapsis review – sci-fi satire targets the gig economy                                         ","This sensitive but flawed sci-fi comic dystopia walks the strange new frontier of the modern gig economy that has also been explored by Ken Loach’s Sorry We Missed You and Nomadland. It takes place, like Boots Riley’s Sorry to Bother You, in an innocuous present tinged with an Instagram-filter of light futurism. And it is driven by a similar sly ideological fury as Sorry to Bother You – only it is even more absurdist and, crucially, not as funny. A rare case of an actor whose real name fits the role even better, Dean Imperial plays Ray, an old-school denizen of New York – complete with wifebeater and tinted shades – forced to seek out lucrative new work in order to put his brother Jamie (Babe Howard) into a clinic to receive treatment for a weird fatigue syndrome called Omnia. Despite being a technophobe who shuns the quantum computing revolution sweeping the world, he accepts work as a contractor laying “quantum cable” in remote areas for comms giant CABLR. Signing on to the app that assigns him routes, grinning and bearing the patronising tech-empowerment speak (“Challenge your status quo!”), Ray starts getting dirty looks from his co-workers when he reveals the username that has been assigned to him: Lapsis Beeftech. Director Noah Hutton (who has a documentary background but makes his full-length fiction debut here) makes the main play an almost dadaist joke. Dictated partly by the budget, no doubt, it is that this 21st-century hi-tech revolution looks so lo-fi: the contractors literally unspool cable in the wilderness, re-supplied by drops from drones. Even the spindly legged robots who CABLR force them to compete with look like something you might have bought in the 1990s Argos catalogue. It’s more eccentric than funny, though, and the limited plausibility eventually blunts the edge of the social satire Hutton is aiming at. Instead, during a middle section that consists of little more than Ray trudging down forest paths, the director leans too much on polemical rants about exploitation from his co-workers. The fuzzy premise picks up momentum in the last third, as, thanks to activist colleague Anna (Madeline Wise), more is revealed about the history of Ray’s controversial avatar. Lapsis is admirably fired-up film-making, and certainly original, but – like many revolutions – gets bogged down as it fusses over the details. • Lapsis is released on digital platforms on 5 July.",Lapsis,FILM
"496 ","The Place of No Words review – a dying father’s magical travels with his son                  ","This film is a charming family affair. Director Mark Webber stars with his wife Teresa Palmer and their son Bodhi, in a magical realist story that feels at once awe-inspiring and intimate. A dying father struggles to communicate to his young son about matters of life and death and, through storytelling, the parents concoct a fantastical tale of a Viking father-and-son duo who go on adventures and encounter mysterious creatures, all while wearing enormous fur coats. The film ingeniously alternates between a cramped hospital room and the vast, lush imaginary world where the father is no longer confined to his sickbed but instead roams around with his son on heroic quests. Patrice Lucien Cochet’s cinematography is especially inspiring in the Viking portion: the sombre grey sky, the rocky paths, the patches of green moss, all come beautifully together and add an austerity to the quirky details of this magical world. The childlike nature of the quests is endearing, as the pair waddle through a farting swamp or cross paths with monsters that sneeze massive snots. The visuals in these segments are impressive, yet the content is wonderfully attuned to the kind of impromptu stories that parents tell their children before bedtime. The film’s weakness lies in the “reality” sequences; in contrast to the engaging playfulness of the magical scenes, the scenes between the grownups are overly maudlin. Bodhi Palmer is still the one adorable constant: within a relatively freeform story and in the company of his parents, Bodhi doesn’t even seem to perform. He just is, and it is a joy to watch. • The Place of No Words is released on 5 July on digital platforms.",The Place of No Words,FILM
"497 ","White on White review – a damning snapshot of South American colonisation                     ","Colonisation does not come off well in this sparse and striking drama, set in snowbound 19th-century Tierra del Fuego. It’s a sombre study of the corrupted values and decayed morals that enabled a genocide; it centres on a photographer who considers himself superior to the coarse white settlers around him, but is really part of the same system. This is Pedro (Alfredo Castro), a middle-aged loner who has been brought to this end-of-the-world location to take the wedding portrait of Mr Porter, the big landowner. But when he arrives, Mr Porter is nowhere to be found; only his bride, Sara, who looks little older than a teenager. In an early, uncomfortable scene, Pedro blithely “arranges” Sara into what he considers an attractive pose, pulling her wedding dress off her shoulders, ostensibly for the groom’s benefit: “He’ll like it better this way.” The scene is to be reprised even more excruciatingly later on, after Pedro takes a shine to Sara and sets up a more “artistic” photoshoot. Pedro doesn’t find much else to appreciate here. In Mr Porter’s absence, he is consigned to an extended stay among the (overwhelmingly male) settlers, whose exploits he dignifies with his camera but whose company he shuns – initially, at least. These Europeans are making their first inroads into this landscape: erecting houses, putting up fences, and killing and kidnapping the indigenous population. They are paid according to the number of human ears they bring back. “Think of it as humanitarian work,” one of them tells Pedro. Director Théo Court does a fine job of capturing the barren beauty of this landscape and using it to suggest the broader moral vacuum. There are contrasts between the blinding daytime brightness and pitch-black nights, human figures are reduced to ant-like presences in the vast expanses. At times, though, the storytelling is a little too distant, and the narrative momentum falters. Perhaps conscious of the issues of representation he is dealing with, Court invites us to come to our own conclusions rather than spoon-feeding us a point of view. • White on White is released on 30 June on Mubi.",White on White,FILM
"498 ","Embattled review – oddly compelling and nuanced cage fighting family drama                    ","Part classic montage-showdown sports movie, part southern gothic Oedipal family drama, this decidedly peculiar but oddly compelling film is the proverbial curate’s egg. The plot revolves around the fraught relationship between a mixed martial arts cage fighting champion named Cash Boykins (Stephen Dorff, a sinewy mass here of cut muscle, tattoos and barely controlled rage) and his semi-estranged 18-year-old son Jett (newcomer Darren Mann, more than holding his own). In possession of a much finer soul than his old man, high-school senior Jett lives in a modest suburban house with his waitress mother Susan (Elizabeth Reaser) who divorced Cash a while back, and younger brother Quinn (Colin McKenna, delightful), a sweet, cheeky kid who happens to have Williams syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects physical and mental development. Jett has a weird, semi-professional relationship with Cash, having been groomed to be the next MMA in the family by the domineering patriarch, but there’s deep reservoir of hurt between them due to the fact that Cash used to beat Susan and treated Quinn, whose disability he couldn’t accept, with appalling cruelty. Outwardly, Cash revels in obnoxious, macho swagger, indicated in the very first scene wherein he discusses his penis size at length. Plus, a good white son of Alabama, he loves to spout sexist, racist hate speech even though he’s currently married to Jade (Karrueche Tran), a biracial woman with whom he’s had another son. But screenwriter David McKenna and director Nick Sarkisov take pains to indicate Cash’s own past as an abused child. Still, that doesn’t stop him from pushing Jett to take part in an unlikely-to-happen-in-the real-world fight with him, for a pay-per-view audience, that’s filmed with brio but at numbing length in the last quarter of the film’s running time. Personally, I felt less engaged here by the fisticuffs than by the surprisingly nuanced and insightful portrait – viewed through Jett’s and Susan’s eyes – of what it’s like to have a disabled member of the family, particularly for a sibling. It’s here that Mann really comes into his own and displays an acting range more impressive than his stunt work in the fight scenes. Also, Donald Faison is utterly charming as a paraplegic veteran turned special needs teacher who represents a possible suitor for Susan. • Embattled is released on 5 July on digital platforms.",Embattled,FILM
"499 ","A Perfect Enemy review – devious Euro-thriller with the manic pixie dream girl from hell      ","“Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.” That’s the Saint-Exupéry zinger with which star architect Jeremiasz (Cold War’s Tomasz Kot) closes a Paris lecture, after describing his conversion to designing buildings with a social purpose. But the unsound psychological foundations, and the cost, of perfectionism are the theme of this well-written, devious Euro-thriller. Grabbing a taxi to catch a flight back to Poland, Jeremiasz lets improbably named twentysomething Texel Textor (Athena Strates) hop along for the ride. She’s so intent on chatting that she leaves her luggage on the street, and both of them end up missing their flights. Jeremiasz settles in for a two-hour wait in the Charles de Gaulle airport extension that, in this reality, he designed, but inevitably bumps into Texel again. He tries to give her the cold shoulder, but, after she makes an alarming admission and insists she tells him her story, he consents to being her captive audience. Both Strates and Catalan director Kike Maíllo – eager to make this dysfunctional fabulism fly – overplay a bit in the opening stages. But the film soon settles into an engrossing power game, as Jeremiasz tries to work out what this manic pixie dream girl from hell wants from him. Recounting how she once apparently successfully wished death on a classmate in the Netherlands, she admits to being possessed by a destructive spirit: “the perfect enemy”. Forming a perfect cornice with Jeremiasz’s preoccupations, it’s not the only hint that their pasts are directly linked. Strates, who physically resembles Carey Mulligan in Promising Young Woman, makes Texel into an almost endearing antagonist: rascally, obsessive and haunted. Maíllo, making his English-language debut, effortlessly sustains the tension and sprinkles in some dinky visual touches, like the architectural model of the airport in which miniatures of Jeremiasz and Texel, and ominous blood splatter, appear. Thriller perfection is not too far away. • A Perfect Enemy is available on digital platforms on 5 July.",A Perfect Enemy,FILM
